Well at least it was
That's awful but at least it shouldn't rip out anything from the ports Unlike that time that time that MSI had the galaxy brain moment where they put a completely useless sticker on top of the fan of their GTX 970's which more than a few people damaged in removing the sticker as it pulled the fan out of its seating
surely just a cardboard or paper with the same info in the box on top of the board wouldve worked better
Good idea bad execution They just need to spend the 0 01 on better labels
this is literally the job for the manual tf asrock
They went 's it
Great job asrock you had one job and it would be better if you didn't even do it Hey asrock next time put sticker on CPU socket and then put plastic cap over it thumbs up
People are missing the point The stickers exist to prevent returns Ryzen 7000 has an absurdly long post time for first boot 5 10 minutes Even jays2cents had to call and ask if the board was dead The stickers are there precisely because people don't read the fucking manuel and would just keep turning it off every 30 seconds instead of just waiting Still Asrock what the fuck Use masking tape or something that actually peels off the fucking dimm slots
Well it's Asrock
Holy crap That's frustrating enough on a fast food sticker This is unbelievable You'd figure they could have at least used something laminated That's unreal
That s hilariously bad
powerwash it should come off easily
I feel like the mem installation guide thing is a ok idea execution is just bad might as well stick it on the back of box would be better
Who was the brainiac that vouched for this
My G
Good idea wrong execution
wtf is this crap lol
holy shit is that real wtf were they thinking
A piece of paper taped at the lock thingies would have worked the same and wouldnt create this mess
thats like buying a car and having the interior glued with plastic
Fail for Asrock I mean look at it the glue and paper are inside the contacts Send it back
Oofababoofa
Marketing liked those designer mockups nothing else matters these days
This would be an immediate return to store for me Fuck that Down the line you may have issues might have memory stability issues etc Imagine trying to do an RMA later and arguing with Asrock that the sticker glue in the dimm slot wasn't your fault Nope sent that shit right back Companies need to be rewarded for their stupidity
Paper based stickers over the ram slots Who the fuck approved that
Good idea horrible execution
Post it on r asrock
wow that is the dumbest idea I have ever seen
just send it back it's so dumb
Solclean is a great sticker and goo remover that leaves effectively nil residue We use it at work preparing brand new cars for sale
I only give Asrock a pass because they meant well but yikes
They could have just used a weaker glue
I do like this idiot proofing thing but that kind of sticker could of been shrunk to a more simplified diagram with the option to cleanly remove it Not everyone reads manuals so if this idea is done right the example given is not it can be helpful for some cough prebuilders
they could've used a foil at least so it doesn't break like that
Bro that's a STICKER Why would they ever do that like seriously Ever
Put the sticker on a plastic shield like for cpu Then have the shield clip into the slots Its already super expensive board fuck the oh its slightly more expensive this way dont put a sticker at all if thats the reason
Almost smart Great idea bad execution
Pro tip to mobo makers or whatever the fuck who put's a sticker on the DIMM slots If you're going to put a fucking sticker on the DIMM slot make sure you're not using paper Use a fucking plastic or something harder than paper that can be remove all at once But if you can avoid putting a damn sticker on the DIMM slot then plaster the whole fucking package about the fucking information about the DIMM slot so you can avoid putting a damn sticker on the DIMM slot Jesus Christ
Oh Asrock Never change
I'd send it back for a replacement then a full refund if it happened again
Who even came up with this nonsense lol
Is that some new type of warranty void sticker
It should just be plastic film instead of paper and this wouldn't happen But as rock is the worst motherboard company the past many generations so it doesn't suprise me they fuck this up too
Blow dryer and a lot of patience getting the little bits from your first attempt or just return it
Ya'll really suck at pulling off stickers
Stickers solid AS Rock
Update I hope people see this Got a reply in r asrock from a asrock moderator stating that future batches of AM5 motherboards from asrock will not have this sticker Fantastic news
You know you are supposed to peel it from top to bottom right
Well shit I always hated Asrock My Mobo had a similar sticker but it had a metal sheet like texture and weaker glue
Just take it off newbie
I HATE PAPER FUCKING STICKERS
What if the issue is it needed to be pulled from the top not the bottom
buying ASRock motherboards that's your own fault son
Serves you right buying a x670 board
I know it's a relatively minor shitty thing to do but some are making a big deal over nothing Warm it up with hair dryer before removing and or use shipping tape to remove I've had Asrock B550 I mobo kill my 5950x from resetting UEFI to defaults so sticker is nothing
Wow what an awful idea by whoever implemented that Hopefully it doesn't leave behind too much sticky residue on the memory slots Pretty frustrating to buy an expensive new board and see that
It s a sticker You can remove it Stop complaining
Said it before take a cloth take WD40 put some WD40 on the cloth Press cloth on sticker WD40 will dissolve the glue inside the sticker can remove it easily Its non conductive non corrosive If there should be visible traces of WD40 be left take window cleaner and another cloth and remove them Bet the glue on the sticker wasnt supposed to be that strong Or the sticker was supposed to be made of foil instead of paper
You could have or perhaps SHOULD have stopped but you continued on Deal with it
Heat up before peeling
Hair dryer first
Awful
But why Seriously do those new Boards don't have a manual
This could have easily been a pamphlet included in the box Or a piece of
nice idea poorly executed
there's so many ways they couldve done this better a proper sticker for one Putting a piece of paper thin foam over it and sticking it to the dimm slot plastic bits A plastic clip that spans the width of the slots and has a sticker on it
ASRock said You paid for extra work for yourself
heat it up a bit first
Oh good a delicate paper sticker across 8 individual 's kid that just started working there
Wash with a litre of vodka
Truly thanks for being an early adopter Feedback yo AMD should help sort out the early release issues like this
This is really stupid but for the people in the future who face this issue use a hair dryer first to make easier to remove to sticker
Certified asrock moment
Its ripped I thought it was just shiny skull
This is the second pic i have seen this happend did someone reach out to asrock or gamernexus yet
I would try a hair dryer to heat that sticky shit up and try and remove it that way or RMA
WOW this really is a bad idea I wonder if all of this particular motherboard have the sticker A tiny piece of the sticker could get stuck in the dimm slot and cause contact problems and you wouldn't even realize it
well now you can't say you didn't watch way cheaper square corner paper sticker than vinyl polyester sticker
Next time dab some 99 isopropyl on top of the sticker with a cotton ball and it should come up much easier
This is a RMA this crap
I'd probably just return it and buy from a different company You bought an x670E Taichi You could probably get at least a decent MSI or Asus board with no sticker over the RAM slots for the same price
Why would ASRock do something like this Smh what id do is get a hairdryer to pull up the rest of the sticker just make sure you don't heat up the board too much
Just soak it in some water it'll come off
Oh Assrock
It's literally packaging printing 101 to use vinyl stickers where it needs to peel easily They weren't thinking or were too focused on the cost savings with paper
Paper stickers and everyone who uses them should burn in a fire Not like a very hot fire where there will be some pain and then it is over but i somewhat cool fire where they will suffer for a long long time
Could at least be those plastic stickers that don't leave residue
Nah good idea but terrible execution They cheaped out and went with paper stickers instead of plastic This same concept would work fine with a plastic sticker that doesn t break alert when you try to unpeel it
What in the hell
It's not a bad idea it's just a bad execution They chose the wrong kind of sticker
I remember when everyone was saying that Asrock is shit and now somehow everyone is buying it
Call the authorities wtf is this LOL
Big yikes
well thats annoying
gif giphy wVcNP3TnXbl84
Nah the worst idea ever is buying Asrock in the first place
I thought it was a reflection but what the hell
return it and charge 250 dollar for each lost business day that's hilarious
Great idea bad execution They should have just made those made of paper and longer And the ends of the paper add some adhesive Then just stick them into these ram clips locks and indent the middle Problem solved
There are better ways than using stickers but ASRock went with stickers with strong adhesive They could have used paper card that clips onto the DRAM slots or even better stick the paper onto the ESD bag or protective cover
Why not just label them 4 2 3 1 or 2 1 2 1 I looked at it again while writing they label it anyway so why Also why is 2 the primary slots Also you know the manual or just anything other than a shitty sticker
r crappydesign
when the ripping speed exceeds speed of sound this happens ppl need to chillax when they are overzealously trying to save 05 seconds by removing the sticker at lightspeeds just to finish their build quicker KAPP
Asrock used to put a sheet inside the box for this information wtf happened
It is to make sure you are very familiar with the sticker
Well that's new I have a Z690 Taichi and it didn't have those stickers on them
What a nightmare
I suggest blow drying it a bit before removing Works with other glued taped stickers as well
IPA and
Wait till you flip over the CPU socket cover and find the shipping label
return this shit as defective until they get the point
That deserves a water hose beating to the old twig and berries
This is becoming as popular as glass panels on tile floors Just use a hairdryer ggez
Excuse my ignorance but am i seeing gears in the bottom of the image
Are they only on the Asrock boards
Should have used paper should have used plastic should have used the correct glue you should slow down and be more gentle Fuck all the above Stupid idea Stupid execution Never put any adhesive or and compound into a slot that could leave a residue of any kind It s a motherboard ffs If people can t figure out which slot to use by reading the damn manual then they shouldn t be buying motherboards We aren t stupid
for the price they are asking paper stickers with cheap glue shouldn't be a thing on memory slots looks like a last minute rush to prevent calls RMA
It's not a bad idea The crappy stickers are the bad idea
And I am getting a refund
Literally just use a little bit of heat from a hairdryer and the adhesive will peel right off with it Leaving nothing behind
Absolute idiots for doing this Feels like the prebuilt IO sticker BS all over again
yeah this is odd
If they were at least made from solid plastic Damn this cheap paper stuff
Buying ASRock That's your first mistake
The even worst idea was to buy AsRock
Should have been plastic backed stickers
They should've just printed the instructions on the PCB right by the RAM slots so this wasn't needed Oh they did So why did they put a sticker over it face with raised eyebrow
Always use a heat gun when removing stickers where you don t want it to tear a hair dryer would even work Having said that putting this sticker here is a terrible idea on their part I could come up with a handful of better ideas that don t involve stickers
It's like cheap bubblegum from the 90's just eat it with the paper
I don't think this is at x670 thing looks like an ASRock thing Both the Asus hero nor extreme have those
Hair dryer itll soften the glue yes thats a dumb idea of them but when you pay a lot of money for something take more care of it than just ripping the sticker off
There should b psa or something saying use hairdryer to soften a glue then peel
2nd worst idea ever First worst is only two PCI slots and split x16 between them because they decide to burn all the lanes on non existent gen 5 storage and fifty USB ports
That sucks and all but Im confused by the socket cover How am I supposed to install the processor BEFORE removing the cover
Next time try top to bottom peel
Board looks badass though
What good is a guide if you can t reference it during installation
Whyy It's silkscreened on the board right next to and besides if you know what you're doing you don't need it and if you don't know then you need to look into the manual anyway And who puts in 1 stick into an X670 board Surely if you can afford it you can also afford to run dual channel
SAME BOARD SAME THING I took a picture and was about to post it After 20 min of cleaning out ALL the paper from the ports the person that decided this was a good idea should be punched A sticker there is not a bad idea but the glue they used was way too strong
I like Asus and MSI motherboards
Just spray it with some water
I cannot believe how many people have had this happen in the last 48 hours Someone at ASRock should lose their job for deciding this was necessary Which dumb tech youtuber has a relationship with ASRock so we can spam their page and tell them to make a video about it like the entire world is on fire and make sure the thumbnail for the video is hot pink with a dumb picture of their face making a frown
You can easily remove that residue with some alcohol to be fair
Get some strong tape such as duct tape place over the residue and use it to peel it off
Bruh
They should just label the tabs Make that universal it would be so much easier
Moisten it with isopropyl alcohol Wait for it to dry a little bit and pull it off
Good idea poor execution Should be like post it strength adhesive on postcard like cardstock
The sticker is a good idea the material used is a bad idea
You didn't apply water first
I would be so mad haha
AsRock is a group of fuckin morons
Asrock is terrible Tried it before never going back
A great idea horribly executed
asrock lol
Imagine buying from the brand who has the highest rated motherboard failures on the market due to poor VRMs
Lol why the hell are there GEARS on the motherboard They must think we're children
FSSanxious face with sweat
Screams loudly
Good Idea Bad Execution
Great idea the worst possible execution
That s almost worth an RMA
They should have used a plastic sticker instead of paper Try sticking tape to it to pull it off
it was fine in the manual
Whoever thought this was a good idea must be fired I mean it
Every complaint I've seen of this has been ASRock and somehow that doesn't surprise me in the slightest
Just add salt and sand
i dont see what the shit
Those are designed to trap particles and dust mites that would otherwise reach the connectors and interfere with 6000MT s speeds You may not like it but those stickers ensure peak performance
Are they stupid or what the hell
Just push the ram through
That would really piss me off
ASRock
RMA it
RMA return Maybe it will get them to stop doing stupid shit
Peel from top u dumbo
The idea is not bad the glue used is bad if they used one of the post it type there would be no problems
Geez Got this same board coming Pretty excited about it honestly
RMA it and hope Asrock sends you one without the sticker
The first mistake was buying ASRock
Are stickers only for US market
Try peeling instead of going full rip it off mode
Literally had to go over each socket with sharp tweezers to pick all the sticker pieces out And I was super careful while peeling it pretty much unavoidable and terrible idea
Its made from dielectric tape Pop the cherry and cram it in
To all the people who don't RTFM this is all your fucking faults
Some hot water and soap will get that right out
i'm always pro more things to peel but why would they make it paper
maybe just make glue very weak just enough to hold that paper or only holding a bit in middle where it's just little annoying to remove it
Great idea bad execution
You are supposed to peel it off
What do you expect on a 500 motherboard paper cardboard insert Nah you get a sticker that probably cost the same or more
tl dr don't buy asrock
Asrock moment
Oh god that's awful Surely they must've known that this type of sticker would cause problems Didn't they test this
Pro tip use a hair dryer to warm it up in the future will probably come right off
That must be manufacturer specific What an awful idea
I stopped peeling when mine started to go then started peeling from the other side realllllllll slow Still had to scrape paper
Sticker is not a bad idea now a paper sticker is just plain stupid Make it a damn plastic sticker to get those good peelssmiling face with sunglasses
Like seriously the info on there should be found in the manual
I wonder if that s asrock only or x670 wide They could also have just used a better quality sticker that wouldn t tear so easily
I ve been out of the game no pun intended for awhile Is this the expensive board
Just pour some Goo Gone on it and scrub it off
Was very confused till I realized it s not just a reflection
Now if any errors you would never be sure if it's part of the sticker doing its evil work Just to see your mind at ease Lol
The idea is good the execution and choice of material however is awful
First gen early adopter price
I'd love to see Linus tech tips rant about peel game like that
Man that is a beautiful sight Not to sound like an ass sucks for you and anyone who has this but you know damn well any and all who saw this and went yeah paper sticker should be fine at ASRock or any company in general is gonna get their ass RIPPED x200B If there is one thing a company hates it is RMA's from simple problems that they themselves created with a very small oversight And they deserve every single return for using a paper sticker
please gently pull at a 30 angle above and away from the stick to peel correctly
Imagine if bios forced you through a warning on each boot until resolved or force disabled requiring manually finding the option in setup not through dismissing warning instead No other warning would be needed
Don't blame the chipset blame the AIB ASROCK for doing this
God damn paper based stickers can suck it
What the fuck
RMA
asrock is garbage
Got an Asrock board with this sticker on it in the other room waiting for the build this weekend Thanks for letting me know I have to pull it off slowly and gingerly
Those idiots man facepalming light skin toneman facepalming light skin toneman facepalming light skin tone
Wht tf do you need a Memory Installation Guide I mean thats one of the easiest part
I bought an ASRock motherboard when I built my first PC 10 years ago with an i5 3570k Out of the box brand new it had bent pins and they would not RMA it I see shit like this from this company all the time online How tf is this company still around
Would RMA for refunds
Asrock board users make sure to heat up the sticker before peeling if off from the motherboard
There is simple solution make it wider so the sides of the sticker go to the edge sides of the slots and only add adhesive to those sides Putting glue over the ram slots is the worst idea ever
AsRock board checks out
ASRock huh I would have expected this sort of insanity from ASUS And other manufacturers are using this trick lately yes Think I'll hold off buying a Ryzen 7000 until they sort this kind of thing out and don't do it any longer I would have just looked in the manual
Or you man shrugging
lmfao it's AsRock what did you expect
Yes OP this is truly one of the worst ideas I ve ever seen
Seems like Asrock to me
Why a paper sticker instead of one of those cool Vinyl ones that is easy to peel off manually but doesn t fall off by itself
That looks horrendous xD
That or you have a wee taste of the tism
Exactly the reason i always way 2 or 3 revisions before i but new tech
I have an x670 from MSI no stickers on mine ASROCK thing
yikes
Well Ass Rock messed up
Ahhh that s painful to look at literally just have less adhesive points my god
LUL yeah they did not think this all the way Through
Yeah they did not think this all the way Through
Get a heat gun or a hair dryer Turn on the heat Point it at the sticker and wave it around for ten or fifteen seconds Try to peel off the sticker then
Oh god I thought it was glare But it was a TEAR
Use isopropyl alcohol to clean it without risk to the sockets
Can you clean it with alcohol or nail polish remover
steve you peel it wrong
Not necessarily a bad idea but a bad implementation It would have worked a lot better if it was a plastic sticker and wouldn't have torn
Terrible I can only suggest smth like Akasa TIM Interface Cleaner besides removing thermal grease it's a great thing to clean up such kind of glue and remaining stickers' paper The only thing I'm not sure about its conductivity so cleanup afterwards with strong alcohol and dry with air compressor
My Carrara didn t have that sticker
imho the first long boot time warning is a good idea I was very concerned when I first booted my 3700 x570
This is why I never bought Asrock Figuratively an ass of a company
Just got my X670E Taichi it had the sticker but it came off easily without any residue or issues at all The adhesive was quite weak as you would expect I did stick it to a piece of plastic and confirmed that it will leave paper glue residue if it bonds with plastic though so I guess I got lucky and the assembler didn't push hard when putting my sticker on
I just wanted to write that I got a ASrock X670 Steel Series with the dreaded sticker but it peeled off without any problems and no residue at all I didn't use any helpers like pliers hair dryer whatsoever
I don't have any experience with one of these but I do have experience with removing stickers from all kinds of surfaces Usually heat works best If you don't have a heat gun a hair dryer works pretty well Heat the sticker for 30 seconds to a minute and the sticker should come off much more easily
Sticker shock
Don t know why they would put the sticker right on the spots Just make it a bit bigger and let the ends stick on to the tabs How does something like this make it out of testing
Yeah I got the same problem at least the paper is very thin it's easy to remove without damaging anything But I agree that that is absolutely stupid
Rma face with hand over mouth
This requires a blow torch flushed facebeaming face with smiling eyes
You ain't kidding That's so bonkered it took me a minute to even realize what i was looking
First time using stickers
Dumbest shit I ever seen
Burn it with fire
Loath companies which use paper stickers So annoying
X670 in general is meh I built mine with the 7950x today and everything seemed to go well but found out after not being able to get it to post that a very small amount of pins were bent Now my 600 motherboard and 700 processor are dead
You paid 300 for this rolling on the floor laughing
Why in the world they use paper stickers for things like this I will never understand
My board from newegg did not have any stickers over the ram slots I accused them of sending me a open box return until I noticed it still had the zip ties attaching the foam
Rip
Chexpensive
At this point I would RMA it If the sticker doesn t peal away from the Ram slots without leaving material behind that s basically defective out of the box
Got dammit I spit out my water Lmao
That feels like it's your fault
What a throwback Young steve
That hair was glorious
What the fuck that Steve from Gamer's Nexus is like unrecognizable vs today Holy shit
I had two of those but 980s I think the reason behind it was to make sure people knew that the fans would NOT SPIN when not needed
Tech Jesus was so young
Steve's hair is so big haha
Don't need working bearings for Zero Frozr checkmate
I bought an MSI card last year and it still had that sticker
I had that cooler I don't understand why anyone would put a sticker that must be removed on hardware that goes inside of a system Put it on the packaging put it on the outside or just don't put it anywhere Still remember seeing posts on reddit from people who didn't remove it
Wow he says each 6pin is 150 but the 6 pin spec is 75 8 pin is 150
That was my first ever gpu but I got it off a friend so I never got to the see the sticker Was wondering why I didn't remember it
I had two last SLI of my life But I had to use it to make the most of The Witcher 3 Back when you had to be careful at which gpu you bought because some were really loud MSI's were the best Now every AIB's card is just fine I don't know why it also only had 3 5 GB or vRAM FFS but the 970 is still my favourite GPU
LOL Oh wait I was one of those people Man Steve's hair has certainly evolved
Could clip it in even
or any kind of sticker other than a paper backed sticker literally the cheapest shittiest kind of sticker you could choose
Or a plastic sticker or a paper sticker that is thicker than doesn't tear as easily or with not so much glue
Or just write it in the instructions manual
Could literally be fixed with a sheet of paper sitting there on top of the mobo with big letters WARNING INSTALL MEMORY THIS WAY Picture of diagram
Or better yet a cover just like they ve been using over the cpu slot forever
a cardboard that clips into the DDR clips so it cant move sideways win win
Or write it on the motherboard next to the
I don t know why they just didn t keep that info in the manual just like it is with my X570 Taichi And even if the manual is lost they are available online at the Asrock website
Probably stemmed out of users not reading even the first few pages of the manual I've seen maybe 100 users on r amd and r overclocking with RAM in the wrong slots for example
They could have just put a label on the motherboard that said see the user's guide And then in the pdf user's guide have that information
They could have used a plastic sticker instead of paper
or testing out stickers to make sure this stupid shit doesn't happen
Or print the board layout and info on the inside of the box lid that way you ve got an easy reference point for RAM info fan header locations ARGB header locations M 2 slot types 5 0 4 0 3 0 since that s getting more relevant as boards get bigger mixes of interfaces etc
As someone with an ASRock B450 Pro4 They did this in the past There was a separate leaflet in the box about the RAM compatibility
They should have said 2 and not used an adhesive at all
Sometimes I see stuff like this and am reminded how dumb the average redditor is Won't you think of the shareholders That 1 may make or break their next super yacht
Few people read the manual This is actually a good idea but they chose a shitty quality sticker
No one reads manuals They rather post their question on reddit and have others read the manual for them
Asrock with its Ass Ideas
That s why I don t buy asrock anymore
I mean they didn't have to do this at all which would've been cheaper
This time price optimization was not the problem just execution
There was a post in r ASRock yesterday about this My personal view is if I got this I'd probably consider just returning it If you can't get this crap out the sockets there's no telling if it'll cause problems For what these boards cost it's not worth the gamble return and get a different one from a manufacturer that didn't do this and I say that as someone who is running an ASRock board B550M Pro4 that I've never had an issue with
The directions for good masking tape also lists the limit for clean removal For example 3M 2090 has a 14 day clean removal time and their 2080 has a 60 day clean removal time I can confirm that if you leave it for years it leaves plenty of residue Just saying adhesives can be a little tricky That's not to say they didn't mess up Personally I'm okay with those transparent sticky blobs I think it's silicone They don't always remove cleanly but I can always use the big part of blob to pull up the residue Not using any type of adhesive is best though
My first thought if this board didn't post after 10 minutes would be that that shitty adhesive and paper got into the dimm slots and fucked it up
The stickers exist to prevent returns That's an excellent reason to send it back because of the stickers then Really drive the point home that no the dumbness of it really is absolute
You're missing the point It isn't about the existence of the sticker It's about using a cheap sticker that is nearly impossible to peel cleanly
Not as bad as the stupid fucking clips for the PCI ports on the TUF x570 boards literally impossible to take a card out once it is in the clip just bends So you need to fucking SNAP IT OFF buy slowly rocking the card left right up down etc Be better ASUS
Ryzen 7000 has an absurdly long post time for first boot 5 10 minutes How can that happen
I can think of a dozen different options that would have accomplished the same thing without infuriating the user
Why the long boot
Asrock The KIA of the PC world
They're way better than they used to be They used to be ECS quality level but are more closer to budget MSI now
What is the problem with Asrock I have an rx6600 from them running for about half a year now
Asrock is usually pretty good
Well it's dumb Asrock Indeed
Assrock
Could be worse Could be Assus
The Asscock is real
Just burn it off with a torch
Instead of spending a few mins with some rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball you'd wait days weeks to use your computer
They should make it cardstock and fold it into the outer two slots No adhesive
They should include it in a booklet how about that With all the other intricasies that come with the board
That would be harder to automate in assembly packing A bright sticker on the outside of the static bag on the other hand would have been sufficient
Contacts are below
Not sure if that's safe to use here if any gets in the slots the Mobo is likely done
Rubbing alcohol leaves no residue and evaporates at room
It's a bit late for that
Then hope that the glue doesn't stick to motherboard rolling on the floor laughing
The glue is not that strong it's the paper that's like super weird I guess it's of the same ish stock as price stickers that are designed to be hard to remove relocate in shop edit I mean the paper is hard durable on top but the bottom with glue is very weak
If s no it s the remove to guarantee use of warranty sticker if not s no that s a ram slot guide
Yeah I'm going to get some plastic toothpicks and maybe some alcohol wipes it will all clean up Annoying as f k on a top end board
I mean there was no indication of a correct way to peel the sticker Also looking at the remains of the sticker it's just a uniform paper backed sticker anyway
Wd40 has oil in it I wouldn't use it Instead a non greasy solvent is much better like isopropyl alcohol
You mean stop and not be able to install the RAM modules
People don't read the
Not sure that would help leaving glue behind would be bad still
Tbh I have no idea how to get hold of an asrock representative or someone from gamersnexus not sure they would even care I have reported it to the place I brought it from
Yeah I would say I was as careful as possible lifted the entire bottom edge of the sticker before trying to remove it was pretty slow but it really is the quality of the stickers you get in a kids happy meal Now if I had known it was this bad I would have used some tweezers and some alcohol But really it shouldn't be necessary
Hadn't even noticed that a sticker is so redundant and that point especially considering the user manual should have instructions as well Fuckin stupid
Whoa that brings back a lot of memories
Tbh I don't know how to contact asrock or any of the larger YouTube outlets Not sure they would be bothered with the Raptor Lake launch
This is in the UK
One of em' the cheaper boards are a probably month or two out from release at the moment
Yeah I have cleaned it up with some alcohol wipes and a toothpick Will post with what I did when back from getting kids to school
Maybe it's a bad batch or something to do with temperature during shipping
Chespirito
I was thinking the same thing when I saw this pic Pack that mobo back in the box it came in and send it right back while asking for a new one
Alcohol and a swab
Sure but that takes a long time and it's inconvenient Some isopropyl alcohol and tlc will get you there faster
And then you get a refurb
I would too just to inform the manufacturer of the crappy user experience
1 on the RMA The good news At least they didn't get it mounted first and all of the cabling routed
happy cake day
That's fucked up you know how those stickers are don't lie
I was more careful but it was impossible to remove it in one piece blob
I almost didn't recognize him Damn
I didn't recognize him at first cause of the hair
Jensen looking like a Lesbian but without the leather jacket
Still is
They still come with newer cards At least my 1650 Super Gaming X had that sticker
Yeah those fans wouldn't even Spin when needed after removing the Sticker lol Super quiet
Stick it inside the slots Same thickness as the ram But I guess that's more expensive to make out of cardboard compared to a sticker
Or have it in the user manual
It's Asrock They're literally known for being bottom of the barrel of quality
I have grown to expect nothing more from most of these companies lol
Yeah I've priced out plastic stickers considering they could use the same sticker for every 4dim motherboard they could probably end up paying 0 05 each and I'm basing that off of consumer facing services like stickerapp
Yup People are hating on the idea but it s a nice quality of life addition Unfortunately something was screwed up in execution will almost definitely be remedied on the next production batch what would be really nice is a quick guide printed directly on the board or even as a nice poster It s a PITA reading labels off an installed mobo when installing keyless connectors I wouldn t mind a quick reference pin out of the power reset hdd led block For that matter I wouldn t mind a jig you can position them all in plug at once
Paper over the DIMMs tab stickers that only touch the paper and then the SIDES of the DIMMs to hold it down Minimal sticker glue and it's only on the sides not the slots themselves What an absolute fucking disaster these over slot ones are
Yo faxface with tears of joy I read my manual front to back back to front 3 times while building my rig
They did for AM4 and a lot of people had issues with RAM stick placement and getting stable clocks and timings from putting them in the wrong slots
I mean maybe if my PC won't
But there isn't a picture and colored check marks You think we're animals or something
Dude now you're talking 50 cents in stickers No way they charge enough for this board to recover those kind of costs
Even worse They could have simply used a sheet of paper and a small adhesive strip Or simply fold the paper inside the 1 and 4 memory slots to keep it in place no adhesive needed Or use one or two of the clips which normally hold the sticks in place to fix it I mean the mobo is already wrapped in an antistatic bag and kept in place by the foam sandwiches inside the packaging Those instructions are not going cheaper and or even less dumb solutions they went literally with the most infuriating one
I always read the mobo manual whenever I get a new board You just never know what you might be missing otherwise
They seriously could have taped it over the latch releases and not directly on the socket This is just dumb
If people aren't reading the manual they shouldn't be building a PC lol
that's on the people imo although it's not a bad idea
People not reading the manual sounds like a them problem
Easy solution warm the sticker and it will peal easily
Good idea yeah but why not just place a small glossy paper there with the same information Also I believe the BIOS does indicate to you if you place the ram wrong by saying ram is not running optimally and you do need to go to BIOS to enable D O C P anyways
Yeah I kind of like the idea Obviously everyone should read the manual but you can tell that until you're blue in the face and people still won't And maybe new builders will read it but might just forget and not use the correct slots anyway Shit happens
I doubt someone buying an enthusiast board needs a memory installation guide
If people can't read the manual that's the people's problem not Asrock's
I feel like anyone that s building a PC will be reading the manual or already be competent enough to not need it I can t imagine what lunatic would ignore the manual and risk hundreds of dollars of pc components
Yes this is a shitty sticker My X299 Dark had this on it and it came off with zero issues
You need to read the manual for the motherboard i o that can have a different layout depending on the brand
They shouldn't attach any instructions to the motherboard with an adhesive Something like a card showing this info on one side and the power reset pins on the other would be adequate
I mean who's stupid idea was it to label the slots the most unintuitive way possible I mean why the fuck would you start at B2
They shouldn't have used a sticker at all Cardboard with adhesives not on the ports itself would have been a better choice
High level person decides they should add a plastic sticker Their designer makes a design and passes it to a procurement team who were told to order x stickers Someone places an order for x stickers and went for the cheaper paper ones Perhaps they weren't told didn't know what the sticker was going to be used for etc Packaging team gets the stickers and puts them on as told AsRock gets an influx of RMA's for putting paper stickers onto ram slots This is why QC at all stages is important people put in wrong orders suppliers provide the wrong parts mistakes get made If you fail to do QC those get picked up once it's in consumer hands
who cares if people don't read the manual thats their problem they probably dont read the sticker either
Sometime you should just let people fail instead of trying to engineer around their incompetence The manuals aren't long a 10 minute read with pictures
Paying support staff to tell people they don't really need to do an RMA and Zen 4 just takes longer to boot on first start is much more expensive than a sticker
Guess what people don't read manuals
You could just put the stickers on the anti static bags
I m not sure if you re in the position to assess dumbness if you re returning products because of a removeable sticker
Why did you remind me of this horror
I just rebuilt my system with a new asus x570 prime p Does this have the same issue Not looking forward to having to do that in the
RAM training
No idea but it reminds me of ages past when we had BIOS POST Memory Testing without Quick Boot
The new ryzen series tunes ram timings by trying the tightest timings it can first If it fails it goes to slightly looser timings It will keep doing this until it reaches stable timings It does this to improve performance Older series cpus generally just stuck with loose timings or took much larger steps to post faster I E super tight tight OK loose super loose The new ones are like super tight tiny bit less super tight ect until it can post reliability It's a good system but a lot different than what people currently expect hence the stickers in a place people will HAVE to read peel Doesn't excuse the shit quality stickers Come to think of it a tight hard plastic overlay w I th a sticker on that would have worked much better
I need to introduce you to Ssangyong motors
My brother got a high end motherboard from Asrock and it's actually very high quality with excellent features I remember it was quite literally the only decent option for mini itx I guess it's hit or miss
I got few cheap Asrock mobos from athlon x2 till am4 Tbh i had no problems I would go probably with them in the future
bruh
Kia makes great cars
Thanks Glad to hear that
So shit quality then but still want insane prices for their top end
I dunno they seem the WERE good a decade or so ago but since first gen Ryzen they became bad again being the shittiest mainstream brand right after Gigabyte
Its like going to a grocery store and getting their brand of a product Its still going to get you fed but the quality won't be the same
Their hardware is fine they have some great engineers It's their policies that are bad Like if you ever break the seal on the screws to repaste your GPU they will void your warranty despite it being illegal They don't care If the shop you bought your motherboard from closed in the pandemic and you have no proof of purchase too bad no warranty for you They also blacklisted GamersNexus Hardware Unboxed and others for being critical of them
Don't understand it too Have various boards over the last 10 years used in various systems They just worked
Thank you
It's about sending a message
You'd rub some paper and glue into various contact pins even if you peel it off bit by bit with your fingers and get intermittent contacts on the memory pins Intermittent contact on the memory is super fun to diagnose over weeks on end been there Even if OP does not get errors this way someone will have ths problem
Wouldn't cotton balls cause static damage
Yes
Make cardstock the same dimensions as the dimm slot and stick it in and use the clips to secure it
Indeed the contacts are inside the slot on the sides I have to say that having that same mobo the A2 memory slot was a bit wobbly for me I have checked it's fully seated and locked
Nah all of those removers are just isopropyl alcohol which is generally safe on any circuit board
Oh Christ you're right That makes a lot more sense It'd still an astoundingly stupid thing to do
both Is the warranty void if the sticker is removed s If the sticker is removed and pieces fall in the slots does that void the warranty not s
It's a bit silly anyone buying a Taichi board probably already knows how to install memory
Agreed those stickers are the worst and should only exist to put on people's cars who park very poorly Congrats on the new system
Yeah I have some alcohol wipes that will clean safer than WD40
It's non corrosive nor is it conductive It's perfectly solving the issue Don't hate on me because you don't like the solution
Well did you get all the stuff out and do you ram slots still work
The number of people who don't read the manual is very high System builders put big DO NOT USE stickers over the motherboard HDMI ports for the same reason
Hi I'm from ASRock x200B Even before I saw your post I have alerted my HQ over this matter yes I encountered the same as well So sorry for this we are investigating the matter
I would send it back
No contaban con mi astucia
Bingo I hate when people jump to RMA for things they can easily take care of themselves I agree that they shouldn't have to ideally but it's like come on man
What if it voids the warranty You only need a tiny paper piece in the slot and the ram wont work
A why does he sound entitled B why such a dick
Thanks homie Appreciate you
He's probably still on an FX cpu he doesn't even understand what's going on
I misinterpreted this so hard I thought this was a result of shoving a ram stick in through the sticker
I didnt even know the channel existing in 2014 lol
Steve Nexus and his gaming friends Paul Hardware Jay TwoCents and Linus Techtip
Dude needs to use conditioner
It looks gross and unkempt these days
You could even make it out of the exact same material as the sticker just put it in the port with no glue
Might bend damage pins Also cardboard gives off dust
That would potentially risk damaging one of the pins in the DIMM slot and DDR5 is super sensitive to any dirt or contaminant on the contacts
Who's gonna read a user manual unless it's your first time building a PC
You sir make the most sense
Yeah like the cheap ass TIM they use sometimes that makes delidding so popular
It is also printed on the mobo next to the slots which makes this a little confusing
i don't see the people that skip reading the manual reading some sticker that's in the way They'd just rip it off complain about the residue and write a bad review
The RAM stick placement hasn't changed in over a decade as far as I can tell
Gonna make me head home and check my memory later tonight lol wondering why it won't even boot past 3000Mhz even though it's rated higher
It's not just that on the sticker There's also a warning that first POST can take several minutes due to memory training
People can't read haha
just a random question it probably has it's reasons but would it cost significantly more to just wire the dimm slots in a way that the configuration does not matter Like some kind of switch who goes like ah you use slot 0 and 1 lemme patch one of them to the second channel to make you go faster
Having the paper fold and the adhesive on the sides of the dimms
It's part of the joy I have with a new platform and a unique board I will be assembling my X670E Taichi and 7950X tomorrow or Saturday into a dedicated system for testing need to really nail down all of the Linux changes I need to make on my main rig before making the move So I get to build with it twice
Latches and static free foam piece
When I first built my PC the manual was essential I couldn't imagine people neglecting it
i dont need no manual
First time i read it After that i don't need read it until i need or encounter problems
How it should be Maybe Reality is different and mobo manufactures have to deal with the RMAs
For picking parts sure if you want compatible parts the first time I'll count the spec sheet as an excerpt from the manual For assembling paying attention and NOT forcing things can usually get you a functional pc You have to be pretty special to really fuck things up
My first build was a 486sx25 and I still referred to the manual on my new ryzen build 2 years ago and I'll read it on my next build in about 2 years
I read manuals when shopping for motherboards I have quite a lot of manuals PDF on my phone and I keep all my physical manuals
Sounds good until it's your job to sell mobos and idiotproof them so they don't get returned Our hobby would be unsustainable for manufacturers without idiots and noobs so I for one welcome them
Pcs aren't that complicated to put together
peel And if you've gotten it ripped up like this high percentage rubbing alcohol 90 and a q tip can take the residue away
I don't read motherboard manuals then again I really don't need to There are lots of people who has enough skill to build a computer they know ram sticks go in every other slot they know where fans connect where ssds go etc most of that stuff is very intuitive So they don't read the manual and they end up installing ram in slots 1 3 instead of 2 4 easy mistake I bet there are people in this sub in this thread probably who did exactly that If a manufacturer can stop people from making that mistake with a simple sticker why shouldn't they They just need to source better materials
Someone just ordered the wrong style sticker ultimately I will use a heat gun to warm it up and try to remove it cleanly
Gee there's always fixing the damn boot times
Playing devil's advocate Does the manual have any official instructions for how to remove the sticker residue from the DIMM slots In the absence of official removal and cleanup instructions then suppose someone used a cleaner like Goo Gone which is what people typically use to remove stubborn sticker residue from things around the house Would that person's warranty be void Q2 Let's say someone does use the alcohol and Q tip method Suppose the alcohol dissolves some glue paper residue which then seeps down into the DIMM slot where the alcohol later evaporates leaving the residue behind inside the slot Did the system builder void their warranty by not blotting the liquid with a paper towel in time
If I peeled the ram sticker back and it looks the way this picture does I would absolutely return it and buy a different brand if possible I m not spending 1 2 hours with a qtip trying to scrub off the sticker shit from each dimm slot with only rubbing alcohol lmao I ve returned motherboard for the second pcie slots clasp being broken even when I have no plans to use it Why spend 200 on a motherboard and accept sub par quality It s like spending 40k on a brand new car and it shows up covered in shit and filth and the dealership tells you to just clean it and stop complaining
removable Yeah about
hope not easy way to find out though try to remove your card
And Kia has the Stinger then there s the Hyundai Genesis line that broke off What exactly are you saying
i got a high end asrock mobo and the bloody LED stays on EVEN WHEN I POWER IT OFF then when i changed the UEFI settings to have the LED go off the bloody thing doesnt boot properly never buying asrock again
bought my asrock board for my 4070 for 15 because it had a damaged socket 5 minutes with some tweezers and that board lasted me until I got my 1090k with 0 issues
I also really like the integrated sound card they use on phantom series
My current board is an ASRock B450 Pro4 and it's honestly been great
I think from Audi to make the cars more luxurious and normal looking and started improving Quality got a bit better and people were willing to take a chance because of the great warranty and better looks in the 2000s However lately they've been just pumping out cars and having engines blow catch fire or just die due to QC issues or just bad parts and design Somehow the Telluride and it's Kia cousin have convinced people they're a reliable luxury brand now but their frequent MAJOR recalls says otherwise My next door neighbor was stranded on a road trip in her early 2000s Santa Fe in the early 2000s only a couple years old at most when her engine blew and there were no Kia Hyundai shops or dealerships Took forever to find a place that would work on it so they had to finish their trip in a rental One of my current co worker's Sonata had the rod knock issue and fought with corporate to get them to honor the 10yr 100k powertrain warrant for 6 months even though there was an active recall for the same issue Dealerships and or corporate are straight up denying work saying it's a person's lack of maintenance causing this yet there are crates of the motors behind major dealerships explicitly to replace these engines that are KNOWN for blowing or dying even yes catching fire Check out any of the threads on r cars about them it's either glowing praise for Kia Hyundai are making beautiful fun cars on brand new models that haven't been on the road long or jaded customers talking about how shitty their QC is how hard it is to work with a dealership to finance or test drive sporty models or issues getting warranty work done I don't trust them and I drive a VW haha
this comment sounds like it was posted from someone who owns a kia
Did I say that they are bad
Thank you
You can remove these stickers easy enough by simply placing a cloth which is damp in rubbing alcohol onto the sticker surface loosening the glue You could probably peel it up in a single piece no residue after about 5 10 minutes
Have gone to get a plastic pic and some more alcohol wipes rolling on the floor laughing Will report later
For many people it's about confidence They aren't experts or feel comfortable enough to know they've eliminated any potential problem They see it as always a what if What if that weird thing that's going on somehow someway is caused by sticker residue or paper bits in the memory 't handle that and will RMA
I wouldn't RMA it myself but the sticker that leaves residue on RAM slots is the actual come on man situation here RMA is fully justified and maybe even encouraged as it may lead to ASRock fixing this issue and learning on it
The more people RMA something for an asinine reason and the manufacturer is stuck dealing with it the less likely the manufacturer is going to go out of their way to do something that pointless in the future Why did we have to give our warehouse tech guys so much overtime and double time last month Oh they needed the extra hours because of the stupid pointless stickers we stuck on the ram slots Why are we putting stickers directly on the motherboard components
I don't think removing that sticker should void the warranty But I wouldn't go straight to the swap from where the picture is now I would peel carefully from the top right corner after dabbing the whole sticker with a damp cloth damp with alcohol let that soak in for a minute and then peel After that if there is somehow any few little bits left on the surface I would pick them off with a tweezer If it feels like there is residue after touching with my finger I would then go to the swabs or even better lint free cloth
Happy cake day
lmfao
lol oh geez that'd be fucked up
Or just not put it in the motherboard Just make an online setup guide or something Stick a qr code in with the mb and call it a day
I d put the same sticker on the foam to the right of it
People who want to verify something which is smarter than just assuming you know what you're doing
Some motherboards like A1 B1 some like A2 B2 On Intel I don't think it ever mattered but I know quite a few people who had RAM problems with Ryzen that had it fixed by using the slots the manual told them to use
Happened to a lot of people I know
I'd imagine there is a reason that's inefficient or impossible Since nobody has done that it seems despite it sounding like a simple solution
as others already told you the dual or quad channel design requires specific traces to be designed into the various layers of the motherboard's PCB Making a multivalent design is not like designing an ethernet card which can automatically detect if a cross or patch cable is connected which means swapping only a single pin inside a connector it would require adding another level of complexity to the RAM CPU interface design which will degrade performances and or increase costs too much Since we are talking of data exchange timings in the order of magnitude of nanoseconds every small adjustment can have enormous impacts oh well this trace is now 1cm longer what could happen congratulations your ram latency just doubled
The length and layout of the traces mater and would just complicate the design without much benefit or even worst performance
The important part is the part he already ripped off At the bottom is a table with the training time the DDR5 Sticks need after the first install or after you cleared the CMOS It can take over 500 seconds with 128GB RAM installed before you can boot So if the bootup takes very long you dont worry
Short answer yes It would be better to go for 1 dimm per channel instead
you could color code them but they are even too cheap for that
There are boards which use 'T topology' layouts for the memory traces where the which slot you use matters less because the slots all have the same physical wire length to get from the slot to the CPU But those are exceedingly rare most boards use daisy chain slots so the advertised memory speeds they print on the motherboard box are possible on the 2 slots closer to the CPU with shorter traces but the slots further away do not perform as well because of the longer trace length
It's already designed like that The compromise is that when that workaround is triggered it has to run slower
No It's really not possible due to the sheer number of controlled impedence traces used between the DIMM and CPU and how they connect to various pins on the CPU
its called 2 dimm slots instead of 4
This would likely require some sort of multiplexer for all of the pins to jumper it over to the other channel's trace Which unless incredibly robustly engineered could probably introduce signal noise increase the impedance resistance of the trace and introduce a new component that can fail I like where your head is that though It isn't impossible it's likely too costly and not worth it considering the alternative is to just put them in the right slots lol
Just let me use the 1 slots instead of the 2
I think if it were possible it would exist by now
Circuits are pathways that are either connected or not connected If you want to have a signal go on path 1 instead of 2 you turn off path 2 turn on path 1 Since you can't have two paths cross each path needs its own switch and each memory channel has 64 paths So you need 128 switches per DIMM That adds so much complexity for no reason
That would make the board prohibitively expensive The RAM traces are a significant part of a motherboard design and it's already complex with no weird stuff added
remember when games came with a physical thick manual that also had stories game info in it yeah manuaslare worth reading
A YouTube video is all you need untill you reach the part where you need to plug the front panel connectors but even then most motherboards label these connectors on the board itself and in my case the front panel was just 1 connector that contained everything so I didn't need a manual at all
Well why do you think some devices don't have manuals nowadays And annoying tutorials after the first start
My PC came with a manual Jokes aside I've literally only used my motherboard manual to check which ports on the back are USB3 without having to lean behind the pc and look For me a motherboard is a motherboard is a motherboard
Exactly I can coast through most things and then sometimes just grab the manual to see if I messed something up or verify The Lego clicks together
Sure but the noobs and idiots should read manuals to compensate for their lack of knowledge Takes barely any effort and makes the entire process much easier
If you have some knowledge of it yes Otherwise it's very easy to mess stuff up
I prefer to use tape to pull off residue
It's not boot times plural It's boot time And it's a feature not a bug
That assumes a sticker like this isn t easy to remove for a normal human being without using external tools and that we were talking about something such as warranty I m not a warranty lawyer so I do not care What I do care about is how a piece of sticker that is fairly easy to remove can cause so much butthurt on people that spend untold amount of time in their hobby Or to people that do not even own such boards with such a sticker
You know the pins are inside the slot and not on the top right You could probably just shove your RAM right thru the sticker and it would still work
It's not that hard 15 minute hot rinse cycle in the dishwasher will take care of it
Naah then I'd have to reseat my CPU cooler to even reach the clip I'm too lazy for that plus that was always my least favorite part of a build
That similes are pointless
Wait are you saying kia is bad besides the stinger Or Hyundai besides the genesis Bc I thought both of those brands made really decent cars
Kia EV 6 too
Still overall garbage cars I see plenty of relatively new Elantras and Sonatas with rod knocks I was following a maybe 3 year old Sonata that was burning so much oil it was leaving a blue trail behind it like an 80 s Benz diesel My girlfriend bought a cheap ass 2012 Forte that had its engine replaced at 100 000km I wouldn t buy one Including a Stinger or Genesis
That's just a shorted SMD in the soft power on circuit dude can happen to any
That's insane I'm happy for you Also less e waste
This times a million A Hyundai owned subsidiary was also caught using child labor in a sheet metal stamping plant in the US lol
People forget that Ford and GM lied and hid known faults that cost thousands of people their lives for years Kia only had the audacity to not be American and then try to improve
And you re not even mentioning the theft issue It s a really bad idea to own one right now especially if you live in a big city in the US
they hired a BMW M division head to make their N models if i remember well i do own a 2022 hyundai tuscon now and since like 2018 i know their quality is pretty good for their price i'd rather buy a yaris GR if i could afford it however or a rivian p
Can confirm I leased two Hyundais one had faulty brakes that had to be fully replaced early it its life and the second one had a faulty engine that had to be completely replaced after being discovered by a tech during a routine oil change A buddy of mine had his entire steering column replaced on his leased Hyundai The vehicles look nice but their build quality is suspect
I don't but in the last 10 years they have really increased their quality
You could probably just peel it off gently and not rip at it like a ham fisted goofball
I have mine being delivered tonight Will definitely try this out
But why go through all this trouble in the first place Nobody will look for a solution when they just received their components and are enthusiastic about building their new system It's just a bad implementation from Asrock There are multiple ways to have done this better and they chose the absolute worst
It's a brand that comes from their most popular classic product name WD 40 stands for Water Displacement 40th formula A jack of all trades penetrating oil for which there are many better suited more specialised solutions
Ah demm good luck soldier
That's a great way to remove a sticker that no one buying a brand new 500 motherboard should have to do
Thank you friend
And then you get a flood of RMA's of people who didn't read it And after they have RMA'd their second or third board they will RMA the CPU and RAM too Eventually they give up out of frustration and maybe they will RTFM at that point
It would absolutely compromise signal quality and wouldn't permit the same memory speeds
Small correction a patch swaps 4 pins You reverse the orange white orange with green white green
This Even with DDR4 you could get enough RAM with one DIMM per channel With DDR5 you can get even more capacity per module Dual DIMM per channel needs to die as the default configuration and only be offered on boards tailored to maximize RAM capacity
They have done that in the past a lot Nowadays you are right they are mostly uniformly coloured
Then you upset the people who want big ram numbers tho but i guess you could figure out a way to make slightly taller memory sticks who can house double the nand chips
Or just offer 2 slots for most people and the ones who need more memory can use dimms with more chiplets As far as i understand putting 2 dimms on the same channel is just some interleaving which could be done on the die aswell no
We the poor bastards from poor thirld world countries got the pirated games without any manuals And our english level was cat dog coca cola Playing those games was like investigating a piece of alien civilization D
Pirates from Microprose for the C64 was the absolute pinnacle of game manuals and I will die on this hill
It isn't because people don't read them or to save the environment even The reason things no longer come with proper manuals is because they wanted to save that money increase their profit margins Same reason apple and Samsung aren't putting charging blocks in phone boxes anymore However a single sheet flyer or that sticker on the outside of the static envelope would have done the job
It just depends on how strong the residue is If it'll come off with tape awesome The couple pics I've seen of this make me think that residue might be too much for
Then just have it output an image or something sheesh
Wanting to receive a new product that doesn t require me to do their work for them makes me a baby They ve added this sticker to save themselves time so people don t try to return their motherboards They ve pushed time it takes them to deal with returns onto our hands in the form of dealing with this sticker I ve purchased dozens of motherboards Never once have I had to spend time cleaning any part of it by hand with q tips If this is the case why would I accept inferior treatment from this brand when I can just take my money somewhere where I won t have to deal with this
I see no one smiling I think you mean metaphors
I own two Hyundais Had about as much problem as my previous Hondas which was little The worst part of Hyundai is the company itself and their service The cars are okay
Nope Not saying that at all All I am saying is Hyundai and Kia are considered low quality vehicles yet they have high end models too The cars aside Kia and Hyundai s service and how they handle issues is generally terrible
That s the point I was making
huh this isnt about amd or intel
Well Kia and Hyundai are still trying to deny as many of the recall and warranty repairs as they can for the rod knock issue Their fix wasn't to replace faulty parts or re design it was to convert the engine knock sensor into a light that basically says Hey your engine might blow soon if you don't replace the oil really soon or take it in for service Then when the engine does blow or a piston cracks a block they reluctantly replace the engine
wait why are people stealing hyundais I mean I love my accent but I can't imagine anyone wanting to steal the thing
LOL this is also true if you're very very careful you could probably manage it But these paper based stickers are legitimately shit so some solvent assistance will make it easier Heat would be even better but probably wouldn't want to risk that
Sure but if you already have bought it and it's sitting on your desk ready to assemble this is exactly what I would do I'm not one to complain about from my perspective relatively minor issues But obviously some people are
Now they'll risk RMAs when some pieces of this sticker fall unnoticed into the RAM slots
i mean we're up to 32gb dimms now if u need more than that get a damn workstation class board
I think it already does it with the chiplets but it has been a while since I looked at a block diagram of ram
I admire your patience it's infuriating that you need to waste your time explaining your reasons why you're in your right to return a product
Dealing with a sticker
It would honestly be a waste of my own time to return the board as I don't have a microcenter near me Could they have done better Sure but it's just a sticker
Why would you use a q tip Just use a piece of plastic scrape it off If you aren t a handy person who already owns plastic razors or don t have a deft enough hand to use a razor scraper just use a credit card You can spend 3 minutes removing the label or 10 minutes getting an RMA 10 minutes returning 10 days waiting The sticker was a nice idea with a flawed execution that will almost definitely be remedied by in the next manufacturing batch You are allowed to return something for any reason but this seems especially petty 95 of the burden is self induced
I see no one smiling I think you mean metaphors No I meant what I typed which was similes
My dealership replaced the entire engine for free The dealership we've dealt with is good Decent cars for the money
Huh I haven't heard that at all Is that compared to the industry as a whole or compared to toyota and honda Bc those are very different standards lol I mean my experience with them has been very positive compared to ford and vw though I got sold a lemon vw by a chevy dealer so idk if I can fault vw for that Edit I get your original point now tho
Oh Misunderstood my bad
Intel makes motherboards for OEMs I repair them as part of my job They even make AMD motherboards
Seems like everyone has bad engines now Wonder how long this 2 0 TDI will last
Because someone found out how to hotwire them in a few seconds with a USB cord It s gotten really bad in some areas city by me is reporting over a 600 increase in thefts
I'm not one to complain about from my perspective relatively minor issues But obviously some people are It's a minor issue that could easily turn into a major issue very quickly There's a pretty big difference there
I stand corrected facepalm

I may be a bit unfair I ll concede it s me comparing Toyota and Honda to them yes I know Toyota has set standards in quality management Kaizen which has become the basis of LEAN manufacturing And yes the vehicles are one thing The service I get when dealing with issues is something else that makes them stand out it s still inconvenient when is your car breaking ever convenient however they do their best to minimize it I ve owned a sonata had some issues with the transmission and the dealer gave me such a hard time trying to get it repaired under warranty so I went to another to much the same issue Ultimately they conceded and fixed it service manager basically said dealing with corporate is a pain for the repairs
Ah ok intel chipsets I'm pretty sure its not a broken motherboard many other owners of the same board have the same issue with the LED staying on after the PC is shut off
Mine has 140k now Only work I've had done was timing belt and when some jackass contractor t boned me turning into a gas station Still getting a combined 40MPG and 50 on the interstate around 70 75MPH
is this for new models I don't see how you could do much of anything with the USB port on my 2014 but I'll delete the port if that's the case
Could Has it actually happened to anyone Seems highly unlikely to me
ultimattt I have been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty
Not chipset the entire board is made by Intel The circuit is particularly sensitive in most designs some take the power LED from the PSU pwr good signal but ASRock and OEM systems use a different design where the LED is connected through the SoftPwr circuit or through an EC controlled by that circuit depending on OEM One of the top causes of a no power condition on laptops is this same circuit just behind charging circuit failure where a rather similar style fault causes the system to claim it is charging but isn't and the battery discharges too deeply and the system just dies In other words it's not really an ASRock specific issue it is the nature of the beast

I m not sure how the hack is done but I ve seen an article saying it s certain models from 2010 2021 so it might be possible on yours I don t think removing the USB port would help it involves the ignition a usb cord is just the right size to be a key If it s push start I think you re good At an increased risk of a break in either way though if you park in the wrong area
Look at the picture this thread is based on it basically already DID happen The potential probability of it happening should be alarming enough to anyone involved in choosing this awful selection of sticker at a minimum given how much labor time it could cost them in terms of otherwise preventable RMAs and or returns from retailers
Sure thing 2015 Tartan Prancer
lol are you fucking serious it's not a hack but physically hamming a USB cable into the ignition is enough to turn the tumbler
Just don't be STUPID greedy The bar is that low now
They both use TSMC now and AMD gets a better price from them so it's not like it's very hard for AMD to undercut It just makes it more obvious they are greedy if they don't
This hinges on the price target AMD had in mind in 2020 and 2021 when making these designs and whatever changes they were forced to endure during that time If AMD was expecting the market to be unwilling to bear higher prices we may well see decent prices from AMD simply because they can still make huge profits at lower prices However if they were aiming at exploiting the inflated market then we are good well and screwed
AMD has tried multiple times to price cut Nvidia only for people to say how they'll wait for the Nvidia price drop instead I don't think they're going to cut the price by much knowing Nvidia has had no issue cutting their own in the past Nvidia has outsold AMD with cards that were more expensive and worst performing before ray tracing was even a thing People love to forget how AMD has tried this just for it to backfire every time They will do what they have been doing slightly lower prices but not so low that it causes a price war with Nvidia
Even if AMD beat every GPU in Raster RT aside from the 4090 Ti it still wouldn't be enough Nvidia's mindshare is through the roof But I do agree this is AMD's golden opportunity in the DIY market They may not care as much since their real money maker is server side but we'll see
AMD have recently said they are still dealing with substrate shortages So when it comes to production they may have to choose what they can make MCM CPUs are most likely the most profitable choice with ever increasing number sold for servers plus there are obligations to make console APUs And then laptop APUs and dGPUs need to be produced With enough production AMD should be able to grow in both markets but it is unclear how much they can actually make
They already tried it with Hawaii and previous generations the results are what the current situation is There's always something frame pacing blower cooler 780 ahem hairworks rtx h 264 low bitrate encoding that would be touted by nVidia adjacent media and bloggers as something that is really really needed by all gamers
Last time AMD was on a roll re graphics card people would still stick with nvidia cards bc that s all they know Best of luck to AMD but honestly it s just like fighting with Intel again but somehow fanboys are even more entrenched
don't be greedy lol I don't think you understand how this works The market is going to pay what it will pay AMD will price as high as they can given recent market trends and the understanding that this luxury item can sell for way more than they had sold it for in the past There will be budget GPUs but they will likely be a year late and perform about the same as the release versions Depends on how release pricing sells They hired 23 more employees in 2021 Who do you think pays for that
People want cheap AMD to buy cheap Nvidia AMD would be stupid to feed into that undercutting circle hate it all you want but it's the hard truth at least 6700 XT's aren't that bad price wise in my country so I could always grab it if my pessimism will prove me right
1978 you have a computer in your house 2020 yeah this puppy set me back a bit 2030 you have a computer in your house
I'm pretty sure my next monitor will be an OLED panel with Freesync I love my current monitor Gsync don't get me wrong but like many others I'm not happy with the way NVIDIA is going This is a good opportunity for AMD to get a little more aggressive At least I've partially gone AMD in the meantime
AMD Will I desecrate all the goodwill I accumulated from my buyers for short term profit Also AMD Of course I will
make your GPUs cheaper so I can buy Nvidia GPUs when they have to lower prices to compete
It doesnt matter how AMD prices cards people buy Nvidias shit even when its 500 1500 bucks more Just like 6600XT for 300 360 vs 2060S reskin aka 3060 for 500 550
Lol I see type of post everytime Nvidia raise prices It's almost like people want competition so they can buy Nvidia cheaper People brought 1200 LHR 3080 that's why 4080 is 1199
lol this is such a stupid post if amd ordered certain amount of wafers form TSMC to make gpus a year or half ago on this process node they cant possibly sell ten times that The node is probably all booked up now already so increasing that wafer count is gonna take a long time Kids have never understood how ic manufacturing works or how long it takes never will
They already did it with RX 6000 this is really fucking dumb
also put DP2 0 on your RX 7000 cards when the competition hasnt
This is such an innocent post Production capacity is not easily changed they'll put the max price they can to sell all of their production
They should be pricing GPUs to maximize profits If you look at the Steam hardware share only a small percentage of people are using 6900 0 18 or 3090 0 5 The people who buy the top of the line cards are rich Going by the share above they're literally top 1 ers 6800 is even smaller at 0 16 and 3080 at 1 7 and 3080 ti at 0 74 When the majority of consumers don't buy the top tier or 2nd highest tier anyway there's no incentive to go into a price war Majority of gamers are gaming on 1060 or 1650 and one increasing share is 3060 so people are buying the budget GPUs which will still be for sale New gen budget GPUs will take months before they are released which is what the majority of gamers will actually buy
We know your upcoming GPUs will performe pretty good We don't we also know you can produce them for almost trh same as Navi2X cards Again we don't Give us good performance for price ratio and save PC gaming as a side effect They do and have and people still buy Nvidia If you want to break through 22 adoption rate in Desktop systems now is your best chance I'm sure AMD bought a certain amount of allocation at TSMC for both cpu and gpu 7000 series They will price their product accordingly to move that exact amount and make as much profit as possible AMD are not your friend Just dont buy stuff if you can't afford it It's not a difficult concept
To all the Nvidia customers who said AMD is for the poors
Nah the reality is people want AMD to compete so that Nvidia can lower prices so that they can buy an Nvidia GPU That is what people want IMHO AMD should price them competitively not lower or higher
Bought a 6900xt and a 5800x almost 2 years ago Best purchase ever Didn't have half the issues I had with my 2070 super performance is incredible 300 FPS at 1440p in Modern Warfare on 100 render resolution speaks for itself Software is way smoother easier and cleaner looking than using 3 programs you need with nvidia NVENC is Nvidia's only selling point in my eyes that they have an edge AMD won a long time ago Nvidia and Intel slept on R D DLSS and FSR shouldn't be looked at as selling points Sadly people are just scared of change For instance Windows 11 is amazing people are still scared to switch
The sad truth is if AMD lowers their price nvidia will follow then y all will buy nvidia
AMD 75 100 cheaper than Nvidia then seems you guys not happy with only 50 cheaper
AMD exists for Nvidia not to be a monopoly thereby breaking the law and government taking control They'll be greedy I guarantee you AMD's marketshare won't move and Nvidia will remain controlling 80 of the market RDNA3 won't be more than 10 cheaper than competing products at the 4080 and lower price segment If they were Nvidia would not be charging what they are
AMD We make more money with the servers market You can always choose Nvidia
I honestly think AMD would stand to benefit more from milking the GPU market and use that margin to knock out Intel in CPUs while they're down
All new 7900XT 24GB at 1499 All new 7800XT 16GB 1099 All new 7800XT 12GB 799 Cheaper than Nvidia and under cut 100
Nah them dumb mfs still gon buy nvidia lol
The fanboys will bail out Nvidia every time AMD didn't break Nvidia's dominance even with Evergreen HD 5000 and Northern Islands HD 6000 when Nvidia had Fermi FERMI for crying out loud Yes that Fermi which was more expensive hotter higher power and lower performance and where even the 500 series rework didn't help it Best AMD managed was 45 When Nvidia announced Kepler 600 series which was better than Fermi though not by much AMD had Southern Islands HD 7000 which was vastly better and you know what happened AMD lost market share The fanboys will bail out Nvidia every time
Please don t beg these companies to be the good guy I want AMD to come through but they are still a company Under cutting on RDNA3 if it s as good as rumours are hyping it up to be is gonna be very risky AMD spend millions on technological research to help produce better more innovative technology and they want that research to pay off in returns The market is dead right now and it s hard to say how well any good and well priced GPU will sell I honestly think a well priced good quality and top performing 1440p 4K native card will still sell well in this climate but AMD will do what they think is right for their business whilst also attempting to take market share I hope we benefit from better pricing but don t bank on it Keep in mind even IF they do price them high like Nvidia prices can always drop if sales don t get going This goes for both AMD and Nvidia
900 for a 4070 4080 12gb is a slap in the loyal customer's face 1200 for a true 4080 is also a slap in the loyal customer's face do not support this sort of greed and deception
The AMD equivalent of the real 4080 16gb one will probably be 999 99
If they just repeat the pricing for the x800XT and x900XT tier GPUs last generation that would be great
I highly doubt there will be more than a few percent of difference like the last gens And then Nvidia still has NVENC CUDA etc
November second comes Lisa comes on stage and shows one graph that shows 7900xt matching 4090 in rasterization then a price 999 Lisa then thanks everyone for watching and walks off Mic dropped
Forgive me but isn't AMD already doing that since at least the collapse of the cryptocurrencies It's especially noticeable in the low end where Nvidia didn't cut its prices because it can sell an RTX 3050 for more than an RX 6600 and people will happily buy it
It s not about stupidity being greedy or being consumer friendly It s a business where the only real factor is profit They will need to make calculations and predictions and habe to go with the route that is promising the most profit They have this duty to their shareholders if they don t think about most profit they could face legal trouble
this time it wont be about money just about winning gamers hearts
People want performance If AMD can't deliver the same or better performance at least in rasterization nothing will change no matter what Nvidia charges unless they go absolutely batshit
I'll probably be downvoted but the people in the comments who claim AMD is on par with Nvidia are very far from the truth Even without mentioning RTX or DLSS the driver support is probably the worst it's been in years Bugs take months or even years to be fixed and overall performance in 3D accelerated productivity tasks such as blender lags far behind Nvidia So maybe if you only play with your computer and don't look too closely at the metrics you probably won't see a real difference but for me the recurring issues and lack of support on still supported hardware led me to switch from AMD to Nvidia for the first time in many years That alone is a valid reason for people to continue buying from Nvidia over AMD
kill Nvidia with a 200watt 7700 xt at 500 equivalent to a 3090 ti
This is extremely unlikely to happen AMD will always prioritize the CPU market the margins are much higher it is what it is and they aren't going to reduce margins on GPUs to gain makretshare Through the entire pandemic RDNA2 has been better value than ampere the makretshare has barely changed in these two years
I am definitely going with AMD this generation as long as they don't drop the ball
Just don't be STUPID greedy The bar is that low now
I'm hoping we're in for a good thing
It won't happen AMD has limited capacity and for a time now is selling everything they are able to manufacture They have no incentive to lower price They will be a bit cheaper Just enough to move everything they produce once again
Honestly was waiting for nvidia 4080 but at 1200 just not worth it I'm hoping AMD cares more about their consumers and releases decent hardware for a decent price
AMD just got my business with an rx6950xt last week First time ever buying AMD I got it at a great price and I hope when the build is done it will at least meet expectations If it does then Nvidia will never see a dollar from me again If the new AMD gpu's perform well then I will be ditching Nvidia on my other rig and upgrading that one too to full AMD Nvidia can take their greed and shove it
This is scripted Amd has lower prices Nvidia lowers theirs Everybody is
our expectations were low but holy fuck don't drop the bar to nvidia's level be the better brand also fix your live encoding performance please
Even if AMD somehow makes double the Nvidia's performance people will still go through mental gymnastics hoop to justify buying Nvidia Even now people will choose 3050 over 6600 which offers much more performance at lower price
I see many comments telling that AMD doesn't want to start a price reduction war with Nvidia because in the end they will both lose out While that's true if you look at earnings I think what AMD should fight for is market share and mindshare If they keep being the slightly cheaper alternative there is no incentive to buy AMD Let's face it Nvidia has way more mindshare and if the two competitors are close in pricing people will buy Nvidia People will talk about the RX480 and how it didn't work back then but I would argue that the RX480 580 in fact have improved AMD's mindshare Today everyone still remembers those as great value cards and praise them
Greed will always trump common sense Don't expect AMD to undercut Nvidia by anymore than 50 per tier
Rumor has it that 7900XT could be priced at 1599 and 7900 non XT at 1299
I'm going to retire my 3080 ti and get a Radeon 7900 I need the out of the box Linux kernel support that AMD has been providing I'm 100 gaming on Linux now thanks to Steam I was planning to keep struggling with NVIDIA modules and Linux but seeing team green market a 4070 as a 4080 with reduced RAM pushed me to my limit I haven't owned a Radeon since the first generation All In Wonder Radeon with a TV tuner My daughters PC has a 6600 XT and we've had 0 issues I have several friends that are NVIDIA fan boys who are also holding out for RDNA 3 AMD can make a lot of money short term or they can think long term and grab some market
My GTX 1070 is long due for an upgrade As a primarily Linux user AMD is ideal for me AMD has an automatic sale from me if pricing is reasonable this time around
don't be greedy AMD has never been greedy They have given away Mantle now Vulkan for free to be used on all GPUs in the world They have given away FSR to be used for both Nvidia and AMD AMD can be anything but greedy This is coming from a hardcore AMD graphics rendering pipeline fanboy
That ship has sailed
You are talking What are you 12
Sometimes it isn't a matter of greed AMD Okay we'll price our GPUs so low that we'll loose money for the next two quarters just for you Anon We'll also lay off a few hundred people to finance this
6000 series will be priced low for budget minded peeps 7000 will be premium for those who can pay Perhaps next year price might drop after 6000 stocks disappear
Honestly would still buy Nvidia GPUs if they are 30 or 40 more expensive AMD GPUs are essentially unusable if you want to do any kind of 3d rendering on a GPU and Nvidia broadcast is also a godsent however i like AMD CPUs
AMR already saved us Nvidia 3000 users with fsr2 1 being open Really rooting for team red this gen
I love how despite AMD trying to position themselves as the premium brand and market leader AMD consumers still want to keep them as a value brand
This is wishful thinking AMD could have done this since RDNA 1 They aren't going to They'll be very slightly cheaper than Nvidia in terms of price performance If you expect anything better than that be prepared to be disappointed
You guys are just a bunch of Nivida Card Buyer Want to be whining praying to a false god The truth is when AMD actually discounts their products to the point that nVidia feel threaten and decided to drop their prices you guys all are going back to nVidia
Frl tho I never EVER considered buying a Radeon GPU I know I know hate me all you want but I really like the performance that Nvidia provides But with the absolutely STUPID price of the new RTX 4000 I ve never been more hyped for a Radeon product reveal Now is their chance to make Nvidia stumble and show them we don t want 1699 cards
Nvidia zombies will always make an excuse not to buy AMD
We all wish AMD would do the right thing and give us products for less money but we know they will be in step with Nvidia's pricing They are colluding you can do that in a duopoly Both were sued for it once before and this time they tried to be sneaky by having AMD drop out of the top teir with the RX 400 series and letting Nvidia run away with top end prices only for AMD to enter back into the market with Nvidia's newly adjusted prices
Agreed wanted to write a similar post fuck nvidia
AMD will undercut Nvidia s 40 series by 50 100 maximum and not 30 40 that some believe they will Will AMD still be loved by gamers and PC builders or will their adoration turn sour Companies are passing the 40 75 higher costs of doing business from inflation supply chains and chip shortages onto the consumer It s a tax and someone has to pay it 50 100 cheaper than the 40 Series
How about you fix your god damn drivers
I back open source any day because I can turn to amd when I need it
Hopefully I don't have high hopes at all AMD always ends up disappointing one way or another
There's always something that hinders AMD's performance Their subpar ray tracing being one of those things lately My last card from them was the 7950 and I had so many driver issues hopefully they've improved
AMD you better release a banger now I so want to give Jensen the finger this time As a PC enthusiast for more than 20 years if it continues like this I'm considering to put gaming behind and forget about it altogether Imagine people that is not enthusiasts Game over
I Hope they can bring good GPUs to the gamers I had AMD for years now beginning with the 7870 then the Vega 64 and now downgraded to the RX560 because I had a console I tried Nvidia one time with a RTX 2060 but I absolutely hate the drivers It Just Looks old compared to the AMD driver
Crossing my fingers that they release a 4080 16gb competitor for 700 and a cough 4070 competitor for 500
AMD needs to fix their drivers and or the adrenaline software I'm a new PC builder and decided to go with AMD Love my 6800 XT but I have had to uninstall Adrenaline and use DDU to get my system to not crash constantly No AMD software and I'm running great I won't buy another AMD card though unless this is fixed
still waiting for a decent 75W passively cooled card to replace my 1650 Accelero S3 but AMD has so poor record in that class I'm not holding my breath for this Intel may win that class but in the next gen at the earliest
They need to do what they did with Ryzen 3000 not 5000 Embrace the fact that your competitor is better in some cases intel was better in gaming and make your prices low enough to where people won't care about it Their biggest mistake with ryzen 5000 was abandoning the budget segment and raising prices too much letting intel swoop in and pick back up a lot of the momentum they lost The biggest mistake they made with RX 6000 was pricing things too close to nvidia when there was still clearly a gap between their products The ONLY reason RDNA 2 cards still sold so well is because the pandemic hit and I'm convinced if that hadn't happened they would have been blasted by nvidia again Like you said they have a really good opportunity to increase adoption rate they just have to be willing to put their prices low enough to capitalize
Not gonna happen Outside of Europa and USA nobody considers AMD a viable options Its Nvidia or die AMD will prices there GPU accordingly to there needs and healthy profits with market where the don' t have high market share As has Nvidia seen AMD also saw that people would spend huge money on a GPU
Don't get greedy yet Give us one or 2 reasonable priced generations and save your greed moves when 50 of gamers use your GPUs Or even better just don't get greedy at all even if majority market share's yours Corporate greed just paints a bad picture overall
Already did Got tired of Nvidia drivers being broken for years being stuck at 60hz without a 3rd party hack
AMD has my money regardless
they don't even have an answer for CUDA
They're a corporation profit motive has to be their only goal They'll price it in accordance with the competition and what the market will pay Expect prices to be a bit higher than what you expect and higher than you're comfortable with Just because you aren't comfortable with it that doesn't mean others won't be They'll get those sales and probably drop prices if they aren't selling enough That's business
I am a AMD investor Please maximum profit There is no loyalty in the PC hardware business
Sorry no After 14 years of AMD graphics cards I have had it and I cannot recommend anyone to stay with AMD at their current state
So many apologists in this thread if AMD ever wants to gain market share and thus increase their total addressable market revenue and profit they HAVE to compete on price performance until they can beat in Nvidia at everything People saying oh in the past they did this and got to 50 at most blah blah blah poor AMD none of that matters if Nvidia beat them at marketing that s still their fault If they were missing a feature that people were convinced they needed even though they really didn t thats STILL their fault It s also besides the point because all those points in the past where they had a lead their share of the gamer market increased and it was certainly larger than their current position in the Steam survey At the end of the day they really do have what may be a once in a decade chance to really eat into the competitions market share They re going to have a product they can likely produce for far cheaper that can trade blows with the best the competition has to offer if not outright outperform them If they re fine always being small potatoes well then I guess they can just price it however they want but without miners creating demand I really do wonder how well they will do in a much more competitive market with lots of stock from last gen
They not gonna be cheap but still cheaper than nvidia i think They need money to achieve feature parity with nvidia Only then can they hold on to any market share gains they might get from a cheap generation If they remain behind in features making this gen cheap will gain them market share which will be lost if nvidia follows with a more competitively priced gen I like amd's stuff but if this gen was at msrp when i built my pc i would have picked the 3060 over the 6600 i ended up buying and that's due to the features it offers
Hoping that AMD have designed and priced these to generate profit through volume rather than margin is NOT forgetting that they re a company that wants needs to make profit You don t have to keep saying it guys I understood they looked to have made changes to be maximally efficient on die size which might be a good sign for pricing or might mean the new GPUs are a bit disappointing Or a bit of both Fingers crossed they re in the mood to attack Nvidia s market share now supply issues are less significant
Was there actually any type of benefit for the blower models Like less dust build up or something
Yeah but will these support machine learning needs Seems Nvidia is the only thing worth a damn right now for stable diffusion or whatever
Narrator They would in fact be greedy
AMD is a for profit company that has to do right by its stock holders They absolutely must price product comparable to its competitors or they can face legal consequences That being said there is nothing stopping them from having more SKUs in order to drop in product at a higher performance cost then their competitors
Yeah one banging mid range card at a decent price would be perfect cut Nvidia off at the knees
Lisa and jacket are relatives they dont care about market shares lul
My only worry is that like Nvidia AMD could have set out developing the upcoming generation thinking the crypto boom would still be going on The 7000 series could have been made for a higher price bracket and not just a 50 increase per tier Still I think they will be cheaper than Nvidia either way They really need to undercut them by a good amount to steal market share though
AMD if you read this Know that we know that your costs are lower If you try to match Nvidia's prices we will know that you're even greedier Don't be an asshole
this is exactly what I was thinking r pcmasterrace is full of memes about waiting for rdna3 because nvidia dropped the ball so hard with Lovelace everything is set up for AMD to take a shit ton of marketshare but they just have to NOT BE STUPID
Yeah this is their chance to just pull a Ryzen play on Nvidia Don't fret about gimmicks features too much Just price low and give good performance
Cousin vs cousin
They can t they re just leagues below what Nvidia is offering in terms of features and CUDA cores They ll be cheaper sure but they won t be much of a better value
AMD need to penalise Nvidia by pricing their RDNA 3 cards well enough to stop people buying Ampere and Lovelace Make Nvidia hurt with their overstock
Well let me put it this way they have to improve their FSR drastically to compete with Nvidia If they manage to push FSR big time and sell their cards for under 1000 then god bless AMD
They should fix their drivers first I tried a 7970 after having nvidias all my life and it let me down Dual monitor bugs specifically remember cursor corruption 10 years old then and problems in games like GTA V
lets hope x200B but did you remember how stupid RX6400 and RX6500 Price that card that AMD produce so cheap with No Encoding capability and how AMD ask for the price
Give me frames per dollar and I'll leave nvda and join red this generation And I hate change Come get this market share and enjoy my brand loyalty
As someone who had an fx 5800 ultra and switched to amd because of it I can say that amd has a bad reputation because they earned it At least in the gpu arena The drivers were awful forever They had some generations that didn t increase much but price and power consumption If you ever set up crossfire the driver quality basically amounted to theft The 2080 launch was horrible too but the upside is it was so absurdly expensive a lot of nvidia owners didn t get burned cause they avoided it From the sounds of it the 6000 generation has ok drivers and are solid hardware They have an opportunity here just due to pricing and games headed towards a bit of stagnation due to where consumer generations are Also I suspect the 4000 series is going to be leaning on dlss3 for a lot of the big performance numbers and I suspect that will be way farther from a a free lunch than dlss 2 is
Did you see the price of the 5000 series CPU's at launch AMD is going to screw you sideways every time We've been through this already over a decade ago when AMD was leading the pack AMD isn't adopting anyone with their half baked drivers and finnicky products I have clients dropping AMD after only a year or two of use and going back to Intel Nvidia Damn shame a new generation is going to have to f around and find out yet again I guess the plus side is I'm making a killing troubleshooting and fixing all these new AMD rigs over the last few years
they have a good chance to take marketshare from little enthusiast community but for mainstream i feel like the tech crowd just underestimating the power of Nvidia's marketing AMD tried for generations never really works
Don't expect them to undercut expect them to price it close They've done it with the pricing of the 6000 series they will do so again
100 true I either buy my first AMD GPU or no GPU again this Generation Last time I wanted to buy was a 5850 but no GPUs were available so I went with a 470
Almost the same price as rx6000 What TSMC has increased its pricing alot in the last two years and are going to increase in 2023 as well Don't know the rest of the manufacturing for the cards if that's the same or more expensive as well
Agreed but never really thought they would try n be greedy Time will tell but their prices if same will be in control of market
For now and will most likely be less then Nvidia always But let's say they have a better performance GPU and eat all Nvidia market share up well then bets are they will go up in price as well in long term AMD Nvidia Intel are companies they make things to sell and if it does not sell then pricing will go down That's the end of it People say it's ok with their wallets till such time the company is not making money then pricing falls
They still have to try to hit that peak in the supply demand curve If they price it too low you won't be able to find them or more likely the prices will rise anyways at the AIB partners and retailers and AMD will be accused of having fake prices What they really need to have done already is ordered tons of supply Which I think I heard somewhere that they want to sell more units than RDNA2 which was already their most successful lineup ever
Depends if they price them what they should be or price them as equivalent RTX 50
AMD needs to focus on offering a better value with their GPU's If the average consumer can buy one brand that does things ok but then another for slightly more that does all the same stuff AND other things looking at dlss here there's an inherent greater value offered even if on paper their rasterization performance is nearly the same I know it's fun to crap on proprietary tech but that's the best way for companies to profit off of their development of new things
Also if you want to shake things up with streamers please talk about your new encoders So many people buy Nvidia just for Nvenc Now s your chance you quietly updated your H264 AMF pipeline You have a great HEVC encoder that is support by OBS and YouTube And I really hope you re jumping on the AV1 band wagon And Nvidia didn t even mention Nvenc in their 4090 keynote Show off some clips of you new encoder Try to win over the streamers so we can break the Nvenc mindshare
Depending how their lineup plays out I think the real value could be fought and won in the low and mid tier Nvidia has very obviously taken what would traditionally be the xx70 chip and called it an xx80 If AMD come out of the gate swinging with an x700 class card that's actually priced where it should be at 500 600 and performing even close to the 900 card they could win some mindshare
They're limited by the same TMSC constraints nvidia is unless they're desperately looking to buy mindshare it's not gonna happen Until we get more semiconductor fabs up it's just a lower priced volume approach is not worth it
Unfortunately the rtx 4000 series are already selling out as pre orders we are a vocal minority when it comes to outrage about the steep pricing
It's insane that if they make their highest end desktop card 800 right now that's doing better than Nvidia just did I hope they have the sense to slam dunk this
All I want is a decently priced mid level card like 3060 or 6700 tier and I'm fine I can't afford a monitor the big cards drive anyway
Corporations are not your friends Their duty is to please their shareholders
They need to remember that those sweet sweet crypto miner profit margins they were getting the last 2 years are just us gamers now and we are quite bitter from being left to deal with 500 markups bots scalpers wait list queues etc
Agreed but the titles directly addressing companies are cringe
It would be nice but it probably won't happen
The innovation of zen was the scalability of using chiplets I'm not sure how much of a cost advantage the cache memory chiplets give for rdna3
You telling a corporation to not make massive profits
I guess nobody even talks about sub 200 dollar cards that aren't display output adapters
I doubt they actually have the option they can't purchase additional fab space on current nodes as it's all sold and almost certainly don't have the space required to produce enough cards to make much difference in market share
lol said the MamaSu lmao
Hell even Intel has a chance now
very surprised amd hasnt jumped streight into bed with evga
I'm still rocking my reference 5700 Got it for a steal through Newegg when the reference cards were canned Still performs like a champ in 1080 and 1440 especially with FSR
I think they are going to charge a bit too much to draw market share they would have to probably charge like 100 150 less per card for people to switch at similar performance levels If they win in performance it might be a little easier to convert people
I will not upgrade if they are greedy I will use my 3070ti until it dies if that s the case I would love more consistent high fps 1440p gaming but I m not going to spend an arm and a leg We can t let corporations get away with gouging us
But what of ray tracing performance I m still waiting for GPUs from all brands to have a specific level of performance because it s calculation intensive
I'm not concerned with AMD doing something stupid I'm concerned with the scalpers
Wider adoption without increasing profits means nothing a recipe to remains stagnant
i've never gotten amd's driver software to work right and it irks me im content with my 6800xt but if they dont bring an actual threat to nvidia this time then i may just go back to team green at least my old 980ti did what it was supposed to
I'm reminded of Sony's Playstation announcement in 1994 Sega had a long keynote at E3 announcing the Saturn would be released for 399 The Sony rep followed up with this v ExaAYIKsDBI
Not be greedy should come before than don t be stupid It s easier to deal with stupidity but greedy follow up by stupid decisions it s a bit too much to handle lol
I wouldn't expect anything too cheap since like the RDNA2 launch they are only going to release variants of the top die in this case Navi 31 The lower dies are being reserved for the laptop market which is something that AMD is probably way more interested in securing market share for them desktop graphics
Event has been delayed 4 days because the team at AMD saw this thread and have to reevaluate
these types of business opportunities don't come often amd needs to win us over
There's a balance to be struck here AMD has to have fair prices Not cheap because it hurts brand perception But also not outrageously expensive so that people see the new product as an attractive buy compared to the veritable flood of RTX 3000 and RX 6000 series C'mon AMD you can do it
I think the experts at AMD will know what the best price for the market is better than a random redditor anyways But yeah heres hoping for good
If history repeats itself AMD will come out slightly cheaper Nvidia will lower AMD lowers markets for older GPUs lower and it all trickles downward as time goes marching on Unless GPU mining cryptocurrency makes a come back
I agree More sales less profit AMD drivers are much better now AMD earned a lot of good will from gamers because of 3xxx and 5xxx series CPUs It is time for AMD to get more market share from Nvidia
Amd if you can match the last launch prices for your tiers you'll really knock it out the park
geezes Everytime I come to this forum cult mentality comes to mind AMD is going to CONTINUE to price their products so they get the highest returns possible They are for profit as much as any other for profit company Their Marketing team has truly crafted a thing of beauty FYI I will be purchasing am5 asap on release minute lol
Was super excited for RTX 4000 series but now my eye is towards RDNA3 Planning to get 7950x3d and RDNA3 to use SAM Only thing that kept me in the NVIDIA camp was NVIDIA REFLEX for Valorant but if AMD price performance is insane I can overlook REFLEX
Its hard for them to f'd this 't cost nearly as much as Nvidia's 4000 series They are also not going to reach the 4090 in raw 4000 series that made the competition's GPUs look like a potential better deal even when said competition hasn't even released those GPUs yet
If they want to crush nVidia completely out of the market they could run a few generations of PS5 Xbox Series X class APUs to knock out the low to mid level market segments They would cannibalize their own GPU sales but sell a butt load of CPUs while knocking out a close rival
The MSRP makes almost 0 sense I work in a tech store with insider info on this The pricing is very tight With almost 0 sometimes negative margin The Zen 2 market was able to happen due to intels catastrophical marketing 4 cores and you're good while intel still hanging on them having barely higher single core performances This paired with them being overpriced The zen2 was able to eat up a lot and i mean A LOT of enthusiast processor market share Nvidia is different AMD can't seem to get an edge on Nvidia Not gimmick wise not price wise and not even performance wise Their GPU department has been mid tier centric with some high end GPUs that get out squeezed by the games that are more willing to adapt for Nvidia drivers Not really sure but i think AMD Gpu drivers being open source might be a factor why it's popular amongst Linux users That's my take on it Neither Nvidia nor AMD has confirmed any of this so take it as an opinion not a fact
AMD did not hear this No hablo ingles
The pessimist in me believes that AMD will mostly focus on the laptop market since Intel doesn't offer anything that's close to Rembrandt in terms of graphics performance and gain GPU marketshare that way For the DIY desktop market AMD will just go with the Sell for 50 less at each performance tier strategy
Here's my hot take 3000 and 6000 was such a huge jump It's already 2x the consoles Monitors are still not going any higher resolution So there will not be much need besides nVidia super raytracing BS that gives little for twice the energy consumption and heat We won't need much more power for years Make um hurt cuz we already got the bag I have both amd right now for the first time Because they were so god damn cheap Both computers max out monitor res refresh rate Ya got nothing I need
With the reveals from NVidia things can just go up for AMd if they choose the right pricing strategy Nvidia is out of the top 20 most valuable companies and with those prices that are totally anticonsumer I do not think they will ever enter again in that top
AMD won't be stupid their retailers and recognized sellers on the otherhand will do like they always do add their premium pricing and make them not even worth looking at
I hope nobody is expecting a 4080 16gb competitor below 1000 because I don't think that'll happen
Well they are on TSMC 5nm which is technically slightly cheaper than Nvidia's 4N and still using GDDR6 it's all up to AMD and how much profit want to make
They would have lowered previous gen if they plan on undercutting 6600xt is 650 usd here
Intels new chip is delayed They don't need to worry at all
None of the triple and quadruple slot monster 4080s shown so far even fit my Louqe Ghost anyway so having a sub 300mm dual slot option like the 3080 was would make Radeon the way to go I won't switch case just because of this recent trend to make every card huge and full of RGB when both Nvidia and AMD have proven that it's possible to cool a card of this class with a dual slot reference length solution and I assume other SFF users with limited clearance feel the same This of course aside from the absurd pricing meager improvements in rasterization performance and VRAM downgraded memory
I wonder how much impact does the board of directors and shareholders have in determining the pricing Thats the real question as I'm sure they will demand max profits be had with disregard towards what and how the 'fan base' thinks and feels
The last time AMD tried to give consumers great value to drive adoption in the GPU space Radeon HD 4000 5000 era the masses didn't give a shit and bought GeForce regardless of price performance AMD isn't going to magically beat Nvidia mindshare just by pricing
Glas I got a deal on a RX6600 last month I felt like it was the best option for me
Let's assume AMD pulls through with good cards at good prices Who is the equivalent of EVGA on the AMD side of the market
Non gamers all around the world Please AMD give us a decent GPU that is around 100 mark that can run modern browsers
And they better try to get EVGA Do you imagine an EVGA FTW 7950XT Or a KingPing version I m down
AMD will be fine as long as they don't try and hike their prices to be similar to nvidia
Another scalpers season is coming brace yourselves
they are going to price as close to nvidia pricing as less dont expect miracle
The problem is there are a lot of programs that are tied to CUDA and streamers need a competent 't or cannot give
How much cheaper they do
Don t get greedy You re in for a rude awakening friend
At the end of the day anyone willing to buy a 4090 4080 16gb usually ends up going for performance Now if AMD can get close to the rasterization of the 40 series and they can also match them on ray tracing then nobody would buy Nvidia dlss3 or not
As you said now is the perfect as long as the chips are good I'm not sure how much good it will do if history is any guide But nvidia sentiment is quite negative right now so now is the time to strike No one should be under any illusions that they are going to sell them cheap That is not happening But that new 900 4070 in 4080 name should be 500 or 600 at most Unless they really fumble I think AMD could make a 600 card that beats it However i don't expect them to undercut that much Lets hope they can at least come in at 700 or less for a card that beats it Their last gen cards were 579 for a 6800 and 649 for a 6800xt If they can come in at 699 or less for a 7800xt that beats the 12g 4080 or better then real 16g 4080 i think gamers will be happy with that even tho prices will have still increased gen on gen Its not just gpu sentiment tho If AMD doesnt try to ream us on GPUs this gen i think that will earn them more zen4 sales as well and zen4 will be a better margin product win win as that would be more market share either way
AMD aren't the good guys anymore none of them are The cards will be slower and like 30 dollars cheaper Greed is rife now
As a huge Nvidia fan I cannot agree with this enough Please AMD crush Nvidia with good products and pricing
We need a similiar Ryzen Momentum but now for Radeon I hope they will keep the price under 999 for flagship It's absurd that nowadays we consider 999 as a good price What has the world gone to
Just fix the drivers
I m just hoping I can afford it
This might be the year I switch to AMD cpu wise anyways
Depends on manufacturing scale and supply If they re supply limited it s going to be close to team green
I would not expect AMD to undercut Nvidia by much unless they are able to produce a massive number of cards which recently they haven't been able to
With the Zen4 coming and if these new cards bring the same value with a lower non scalping price like NVIDIA I may finally build a full AMD pc after 10 years
With these nvidia prices I ll probably switch
I'm not paying 950 for a 4080 as long as AMD release a card for around 650 I'm in I've waited 2 years since the 3080 was released to upgrade but nvidia can get in the bin
Their ultimate goal is not to make money its to create value for stakeholders Customers are one of the stakeholders Creatimg value for stakeholders will also return the most profit in the long run They need to ignore shareholders who only care about quarterly profits and focus on taking market share for the long haul
I've been full team red for years and have mostly failed to convince my Nvidia fan boy friends to adopt the platform Help me out by making the 7000 series cards AFFORDABLE to the masses thumbs up
I would certainly jump on a 7900 xt if it s less than 1 2k preferably a flat 1k
If AMD wants to get on the good side of all the board partners who make the video cards AMD will have to listen to and negotiate with them on prices and flexibility Given many board partners build video cards for both Nvidia and AMD GPUs the board partners will want AMD's card prices relate to a combination of faithful Nvidia customers with money to buy the Nvidia cards regardless and performance capabilities to still allow the remaining Nvidia cards to be sellable If the Radeon RX 7900 XT devastates the Geforce RTX 4090 for example the board partners and retailers need the pricing of the RX 7900 XT to allow the RTX 4090s the board partners build to still sufficiently sell to get a return on investment As much as retailers and manufacturers will be rightfully angry at Nvidia for noncompetitive prices from Nvidia cards there are similar sentiments if AMD is able to undercut Nvidia and render most of the RTX 40 inventory unsellable Your money at the retailer doesn't go to Nvidia The money you give the retailer goes to the retailer who already paid the manufacturers for the product who already paid Nvidia for the parts In order for retailers to break even Nvidia would have to refund the product chain for a price drop on existing inventory if the retailers and manufacturers end up selling at a loss due especially if prices are set by Nvidia due to contract
There were too many stupid people buying 2k dollar 3080s and 1 5k dollar ps5s They proved that if products are being sold at a higher price people will still buy it I sure hope amd doent get too greedy but they would be foolish as a company to not learn from the last few years that there are people who will pay the price Even when they were priced under nvidia before people still wanted scalped nvidias
AMD need to undercut significantly to make any sort of difference Lets assume you're going for a 4080 16GB at 1199 or a 8800 at 1000 nobody is buying the 8800 if the 4080 is coming with DLSS 3 and has superior raytracing capabilities at that price point most people would spring another 200 dollars A 8800 at 700 or 800 is another question but I just can't see it
AMD please don't screw this opportunity up Narrator T
I have planned for 5600 cpu 6700xt build Holding to see next gen AMD gpu If it's reasonably priced power efficient and available soon I'll do 7600 and 7700xt instead
I'm interested to see what they do but I think unless they can find a niche the whole market is going to be rather saturated
expected nvidia to go up 100 across the board with their 500 increase on the 4080 and 400 increase on their rebranded 4070
maybe But just like on the Jay 2 cents video They may be keeping the market manipulated or how the Nvidia CEO said corrected to keep the supply and demand at a certain level to keep prices high
Does anyone here remember when Nvidia launched the GTX 280 and 260 And then had to slash their prices by over a hundred dollars when the 4870 and 4850 had better than expected performance and way better performance per dollar I remember I ended up loving my 4870
At the top end I'm not sure it matters However at the lower to mid range end pricing is going to be a massive issue because it's not Nvidia AMD are competing with it's consoles Many people myself included simply cannot justify spending more than a console on a graphics card AMD wins short term either way of course but longer term I can't see it being healthy for graphic card sales
Indeed
If they can leapfrog NVIDIA and Intel's media engines I'll be going with AMD again NVIDIA can now encode 8k60 so that's a minimum but I also want things like 4 2 2 hardware encode and decode and more bandwidth for higher resolutions and framerates If that happens I'll buy AMD again
Yes please AMD dont make a PCI E X4 gpu again
Hmm i don't with the combination of GPU shortages Nvidia and AMD were pretty much printing money
Seeing Nvidia deliberately price their new cards outside the realm of sanity to encourage people to buy the last generation cards that are still filling warehouses and then decide to price match them and manage to sell absolutely nothing would be exactly the kind of play I'd expect from AMD at this point
Linux user here I do agree we don't have much more stable options on Wayland lol
I'm actually rooting for AMD hoping they won't swing on the customers the way Nvidia did few days ago not only slapping up unjustified price hike TSMC increased their chip prices by 20 but it doesn't mean were should be paying so much IMO and even fooling us all that 4080 12GB isn't 4070 in disguise If they could nail FSR to be as good as DLSS 2 0 for now then I'd wave goodbye to Nvidia and never look back again And I've been waiting for long enough to get an upgrade looks like I'll be joining team red soon
Friendly reminder that they all use the same fabs For chipsets and for RAM and pretty much everything else
just be reasonable with prices keep in mind that TSMC has increased prices overall so don't expect cheap gpus they'll for sure be expensive because of the TSMC cost per die unless AMD has some ridiculous die size to performance ratio
Read an accounting manual the sole purpose of a company is to generate profit AMD will price their products according to their competition price performance wise AMD can't and wouldn't save us because they realistically can't neither produce enough GPUs nor cheap enough to force Nvidia to lower their prices They both use TSMC so the only price difference will be on how much efficient can AMD make their designs Making a VRM for a 450 watt card costs allot if they can squeeze performance for less watts it will be cheaper to manufacture I don't see AMD not going after the performance crown even if they lose they want to be damn close November 3rd we'll know more
Make the 7900xt 1000 7800xt 800 etc etc they got a chance to win over the market if they take it will really show weather they want earn people s respect or be known as another greedy company cuz back in the day radeon and amd used to be the budget option compared to intel
Partner with EVGA and come up with some old school crazy boards Multiple GPUs extra RAM all the thongs that nvidia banned partners from doing
Well she's Mr Huang's niece What are you people expecting
I unknowingly ended up going all AMD Steam Deck PS4 AMD Advantage laptop my wife's desktop is all AMD only my Nintendo Switch is looking at me like eyes
They're actually cheaper than nvidia already for similar cards The rx 6700 xt similar and in some games better in performance to a 3070 is 430
A lot of my workflow works badly on current gen amd video cards i need amd to step it up with the video encoders and companies to also favor amd more because right now I basically can t even go amd even if I want to as it slows down my renders
I'm ready to be disappointed I'm not ready to be THAT disappointed
It's time to invest
I had a very negative thought What if Nvidia priced their RTX4070 899 because RDNA3 top card barely beats RTX4070
Even if they price their gpus decently I don't think they're going to have that much Supply because then four is a lot more profitable and laptop gpus are also a lot more profitable so they're going to take their limited wafer capacity and focus on those two first and if there's any left over they're going to allocate them to gpus It makes the most sense economically
I truly believe AMD only continues to dabble in the GPU market purely to keep the duopoly alive If they leave Nvidia would truly have a monopoly and there are often checks in place to keep that from happening Sometimes as far as forcing a competitor in a duopoly to stay involved against their will
I love Ansel for game photography and cuda cores speed up workflow AMD needs more than just price cuts for me to consider switching Also the amount of friends that message me because their AMD card has driver issues or Black screens is just insane I'm more interested in seeing what Intel can do at this point
I've ventured on amd few times in the past but find their driver just not as stable overall as nvidias in general Any others have similar experience
Also a good streaming encoder n we gold
wall street hold my beer
Maybe we see 7900XT at 1299 and is 5 slower than 4090 I would buy it Probably at lower power too
Also create something that can compete with DLSS and doesn't look like a muddy mess DLSS is easily the biggest reason to go with an RTX card
Honestly if they would just release RDNA2 desktop APUs for a decent price they could easily increase adoption into the desktop market by having OEMs make well priced small PCs that allow you to push the TDP to like 60w This would easily be good enough for 1080p gaming on medium settings and could have a pricetag total for the small computer of like 400 500 Same goes for the laptop space The way they priced all their 6 series the OEMs are just putting them in their most expensive laptops WITH dedicated graphics It makes absolutely no sense except that they want to make even more money and their bean counters have decided the adoption rate wouldn't move the needle enough
Guys don't get too mad if the cards raise in price a bit Taiwan chip manufacturers are raising the prices up to 20 If AMD play their cards right and don't fuck it up they'll still have the most affordable cards though
I would switch to an Radeon card if the next releases are at a good price Even if they don t perform as well as an nvidia card shit
Mark my words AMD will increase prices too for now Once Intel starts shipping maybe their third gen GPUs and the market has 3 big players we'll see prices at a more friendly place
Real question have the cards improved since the 280x generation I had one then crossfired it threw 850 watts of power to them nothing I did would stop it from flickering and artifactong so bad The whole experience was miserable with their cards I wrote them off That being said i went with a 3800x for my las build and it has been nothing short of phenomenal
Rasterization amd already has that nailed Just hope the Raytracing performance is good they'll for sure have my money amongst many others to
I'm so hopeful I don't care about Ray tracing I don't care about 4090 level performance I want a nice 3090ti level card at 300w under 800 msrp With a 6900xt being 699 I absolutely believe they can hit that I believe they can even hit 3090ti performance at 250w which would be an absolute dream come true
I went from man it ll really take a Ryzen style Christmas miracle to get me to seriously look at the AMD cards To well fuck Nvidia I m 90 going to buy AMD It is theirs to lose and have me sit on my 1080 for 2 3 more years at this point
What amd could do to really hurt nvidia this time is start announcing the mid and low range first A good performance and well priced amd product can hurt both 4000 AND 3000 nvidia sales If for example 7700xt is powerful enough and well priced it can take sales from an old 3080 If nvidia is waiting to void inventories of 3080 to launch 4070 a good movement from amd could get them bad positioned and force the launching before hurting nvidia
It all depends on what the investors believe cked don't hold my beer
Im curious where did you got the 22 adoption rate I know Steam is not the while representative amount of gpu s in pc s but they are a good rough estimate And according to Steam s hardware survey AMD gpu s used are around 15 compared to Nvidia s 76 used and at the same time top 15 gpu s usage are Nvidia gpu s granted that survey also factors in igpu usage This info from Steam tells me that the AMd has a LONG WAY TO GO in order to increase their marketshare And if AMD wants to increase this they have to resoundingly convince Nvidia users looking to upgrade to go with AMD as their next gpu upgrade
If AMD don't snag a huge proportion of upgraders this gen they need to seriously address management The door is wide open and the bar is low For all intent and purpose they are marketing against a corporate scalper If AMD's RDNA 3 is priced to performance I'm all over their offerings this time round
AMD continues selling Cpus because chiplet margin is way higher
For anything 3d art and vfx I think rtx is more worth the money
AMD has already won by default tbh Nvidia forfeit when they dropped the ridiculous prices on us
I 100 expect 7900 XT and most RDNA3 lineup really to be faster than Lovelace across the stack but people want cheaper prices If it was as fast that would've been one thing But having the faster AND cheaper GPUs This will go down interestingly
since AMD and Nvidia don't have any other competitor regarding GPUs i'm sure AMD will price their GPUs just 10 15 under Nvidia but still raking in profits x200B Personally i see no point in chasing the latest techs now a day especially when inflation is sky high Needs over Wants at this point These companies think they are still in the mining pandemic
I don't agree with this statement ultimately user go for highest quality within their price range Quality is perceived and this perception is affected by several factors such as branding think iPhone Now pricing and quality are 2 different things where as pricing is an absolute value quality is relative to prices user perception branding packaging etc Pricing strategies models include cost based value based and competition based models While pricing strategies are set relative to the brand position in the market as well as it's market share Market share affects affects pricing and pricing affects market share Think Nvidia 3000 series Nvidia tried to force a price level lower than the market could handle thus demand increased which in turn pushed the prices higher due to the limitations in the supply chain While this was affected by several factors including silicon shortages ultimately production output of the board manufacturers and chip manufacturers will determine the amount of product ready for shipping on a specific time Thus naturally there will always be limitations on supply As an example would you wait 3 months to spend 400 on GPU or pay 50 or 100 extra today and get it now albeit a different brand with similar performance A company that is new in the market will tend to cut prices to get market share simply because they have a lot more to gain than to loose AMD is not in that position they are an established brand offering high tech equipment that offers ground breaking technologies and innovations In order for them to continue on this path they need to cover their R D and only the bottom line covers that net profit after tax thus it makes more sense for AMD to be pushing for better margins instead of market share to insure long term prosperity TLDR they are playing the long game like this
Most of the market does not own high end cards though So even though Nvidias prices are garbage even if amd has lower prices with high end cards it won't move the needle much if at all If they released a 250 dollar card with the performance of a 6900xt that might help increase market share But if we're being honest here we all know that isn't going to happen
1549 7900xt lesgo
Nvidia's launch is a sign that AMD will not be competitive coming this round These two companies are practially transparent to each other
Amd was always the lower prices with their CPUs for the most part They really should use this to take market share
PLEASE give me an excuse to switch back to AMD GPUs
If they give me a smaller more efficient and cheaper card that's a Day 1 buy I have to trust AMD sees the opportunity
Unfortunately whatever AMD's plan is regarding GPU supply it is already baked in What this means is it highly unlikely they will take market share this year Maybe next year when the 70 class and lower cards come around on the 6nm wafers there I think they have a shot at taking some market share All that to say I don't expect much of a pricing relief from AMD They will undercut by how much is still a very open question given how competitive they're expected to be this gen
AMD and Intel could Swipe huge chunks of market share from Nvidia relatively easily All they have to do is price their GPUs well
Unlike Nvidia AMD also makes boatloads of money selling CPUs so I hope they undercut Nvidia on GPUs to drive more CPU sales
They only annouced when they would be releasing the new GPUs to the market Which is Nov 3 But when will we get preview of the cards them selves
They already got me with Ryzen some years ago If they can put a decent GPU at low price I'm not even considering it I'll straight up buying it
The problem there is which depends on a bunch of things can AMD make enough GPUs to satisfy demand if not with cpu epyc and mobile being made do they have the wafer starts to make enough gpus to flood the market Will people be buying 2nd hand 6xxx cards that there is very little demand for 7xxx cards if there isn't then it's a case of only those desperate for more performance are upgrading they might like Nvidia decide to gouge and get as much as they can AS in if 60 of normal buyers are going to buy 2nd hand 6800 6900 cards then to minimise revenue loss for the 20 who are desperate for a 7xxx card charge them double I really hope AMD price them well but I've been incredibly unimpressed with prices lately Hell the Zen 4 prices are imo absolute trash as were Zen 3 prices but somehow they are normalised now Zen 1 had an 8 core at 329 Zen 2 had an 8 core still at 329 cheapest 8 cores I'm talking about here Zen 3 cheapest 8 core was 299 We're on another full node drop and a 6 core is 299 and an 8 core is 399 I'm not optimistic
do they have access to the same N4 5nm process Nvidia has Because if not there is no way they will offer a compelling product
YES Give me a good great sub 300 dol card and i will buy it I want the next RX 480 with AV1 enconding support
If every unit sells out instantly it is neither stupid or greedy
Never had an AMD card and if they don't fuck up this launch it's gonna be my first for sure
I literally have never owned a graphics card not made by EVGA going back to my 1st 12 years ago a GTX 540 ti I am building a brand new PC over the next few months My plan from the beginning was a 7800x3d and an EVGA 4080 When EVGA pulled out I said well maybe I'll get an Asus or MSI 4080 but I'm going to wait and see what AMD has to offer Now that I've seen what Nvidia has to offer I'm either keeping my 3080 or getting an AMD GPU The ball is in AMD's court If they do the right thing price wise and have a solid offering I'll for the 1st time not have an Intel Nvidia PC
It's not that easy for them unfortunately The wafer deals with tsmc are done years in advance look at today's news about 2024 26 This means that AMD have already locked in their supply production volume which will be a fraction of NVIDIA produces Even if rdna3 mops the floor with Lovelace there will only be limited cards made If the demand is high that will simply cause retailers to raise the prices regardless of margin or what AMD charges them If the cards are good they could easily end up more expensive than NVIDIA
I think we've already seen the plan for rdna3 since it basically mirrors Ryzen There isn't a get rich quick scheme here or any wild price swings they'll just execute by delivering a competitive product with slight price increases from last generation to ensure good margins It may not be as fast as the fastest 4090 but it'll be close and cheaper Potentially more expensive than the 6900 MSRP from 2020 but less than the 4090 Nvidia messed up by making a product to match the 2021 market super fast and expensive to build while it seems rdna3 is going to be cheap to build and hopefully will be highly competitive
I'm just hoping their GPUs will have better power requirements 450W for nvidia's 4090 is not something I'm comfortable running I hope amd can keep their best GPU at 350W or lower And I say that as someone who has a 1000W PSU Be silent model
I just want AMD to have functioning OpenGL in their drivers then I'll definitely be buying their GPUs just like how I've bought multiple AMD CPUs I know they're currently working on that problem now but I'm not holding my breath
Save PC gaming I can't imagine buying a console instead of a PC
the issue is if amd lowers their prices nvidia will lower their prices just enough so that people will just buy nvidia anyways
I have been 100 percent a team green EVGA buyer all my gaming life Wouldn't even consider an ATI AMD card before If AMD can even get close to the 4080 for a more reasonable price they have my money as soon as I can find one
What AMD card matches Nvidia 3090ti
That depends on what they can offer pure raster performance does not cut it anymore if it did people wpuld have adopted rdna 2 way more but they didn't AMD is lacking in quality encoders streaming quality massively handicapped ray tracing performance no bells and whistles like AI features for streamers and such Amd needs to go above and beyond this gen to force nvidia into a price war I personally traded my 3080ti for a 6900xt plus i got paid 250usd extra too since nvidia gpus are more valuable in asia i regretted that decision with driver issues and generally worse performance in allot of indie survival titles or older graphics moded games And ray tracing was only on par with my brothers 3060ti
Their problem isn't price to performance It's the terrible user experience Which is largely a software issue
This would be great AMD are amazing but many people dont buy them because of bad stigmas Reduced pricing compared to NVidia would open up more people to buy them and would ultimately improve the brands vision and respect
Bought an RX 6600 XT for virtualization and some light computing AMD should fix their drivers and start supporting people to increase their adoption Because currently people that want to use their devices even on Windows are running into issues with driver stability and even installing official
Agreed I haven t had a AMD gpu in 11 years recently bought a a 7900xt Feels good too be back
our expectations were low but holy fuck is a thing
Y price increase on 2 skus from Nvidia since the 4080 12G is really a rebranded 900 4070 on the xx70 die 3070 500 and the real 4080 is 1200 3080 700 AMD would have to go out of their way to not easily stomp that and gain some real market share while still having big margins
If they decide to just undercut each Lovelace card by just 50 I WILL LOSE MY SHIT 7000 Series literally has a major production cost advantage over Lovelace there's no excuse for AMD not to tell Nvidia and most importantly their fanboys that Radeon is not just a choice but THE MOTHERFUCKIN CHOICE of gpu this generation It's time for AMD to throw all debates of performance per dollar out the goddamn window once in for all Gaining market share is a far better long term strategy reaping benefits for years than maxxing out margins for a few months
Thing is we don't know the costs of all of this for either we just assume we are being gouged stuff it expensive and limited right now should be no surprise to anyone Also OP mentions performance for price ratio we don't have any idea yet what that is for the other guys IF their stuff is expensive well maybe their performance is over the moon to AMD sure don't be stupid but there is a lot going on here That said I hope they come out with no brainers I'm guarded
As a publicly traded company they can be sued if they don't do what's in the best interest of their shareholders Yay capitalism
Happy cake day
Just don't be Nvidia level greedy in other words The 4080 12GB is a sad joke at 899
Perhaps they are happy with a 20 discrete gpu market share winking face with tongueface with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughinggrinning squinting face
7600 xt that makes the 4080 10gb look weak for a superior price base every other card off that benchmark tier and work from there don't slot cards in between Nvidia pricing with slightly competitive prices go for the head shot win the generation even if there is 5 7950's that beat the fuck out of 4090 ti's and no one can get them grand stand on every metric
the high end gpus are also not monolithic that alone should give them an advantage over nvidia
Don't they use Sapphire to manufacture the reference card So I assume the final price is a negotiation of profits between the two
Being real we know nothing about price agreements between either of them and TSMC
I do wonder what Nvidia pays after they pulled that stunt a few years back trying to extort TSMC by threatening and following through going to samsung
its not so much a question of wafer price but allocation AMD for sure hasn't bet they could suddenly get say 50 of the GPU market so they didn't negotiate that many wafers from TSMC That also makes it useless for AMD to undercut nvidia by too much They couldn't supply the amount demand that would generate anyway
More than that AMD does not waste half their CU core space on tensor cores like Nvidia is doing with Ada They can literally double performance for the same die area as Nvidia at the same cost
Of course they're greedy it's in their nature Remember they raised prices on Ryzen 5000 while removing most of the in box coolers They dropped a good chunk of costs in HSF materials box size shipping storage space and likely a LOOOOT of shipping weight For all of those savings they still increased pricing from 3000 to 5000 and told us to go buy our own coolers
It's hard for them to undercut because their cards around 20 times less popular choice in some markets than Nvidia People afraid AMDs drivers people want DLSS and RTX If they will undercut they won t make any money
It's not just amd gets a slightly better pricing Navi is much more efficient and cost effective to produce than Ada The yield for Navi is better Way better the architecture allow more effective usage of given waffer Overall amd can make these gpu cheap cool and use way less power than Ada Amd can dominate even take 60 market share if they price their gpu aggressively Then next Gen amd can take the king and dominate in performance
You also probably won't have to buy a new power supply for a new AMD '
AMD is a large company they want to exploit the market to the best of their ability just like all the other players However they aren't stupid I hope that they look at this as a Ryzen 3000 generation ie you have arguably the best product available but are still priced aggressively to gain mindshare rather than a Ryzen 5000 generation where they know that their competition isn't really competitive so the prices in every tier creep up and they delay releasing better bang per buck SKUs like the 5700x and 5600 until the latest possible moment I personally think AMD needs to take this moment to continue to establish mindshare They need to provide a product that hits all three metrics price performance and stability software support for 3 to 4 generations before people start to look at them as being competitive or more advanced as nVidia That's what it took on the CPU side against Intel They also have a similar opportunity here Intel gave them a window by releasing like five 14nm chips in a row and making very little progress for those generations nVidia is giving them a window here with this absolutely absurd produ stack and pricing they have a 192 bit gpu labeled as a 4080 wtf
There is one thing people dont consider Corporate espionage Nvidia very likely know whats the performance of AMD upcoming stuff and priced accordingly
In r hardware I saw a poster talking about how great it was that AMD made the 5700xt at a reasonable price They were happy that it resulted in Nvidia dropping prices so that they could buy a 2060s for a reasonable price An annoyingly large amount of people just want AMD to be competitive so that Nvidia can be cheaper so that they can buy Nvidia GPUs
It's all those additions and proprietary things that have been marketed so well DLSS NVENC PhysX back in the day People seem to feel like they're really missing out if you go AMD because Nvidia gets most of their things and more since AMD seems to implement much more open source tech
100 accurate This post is really dumb and even embarrassingly ignorant RX6000 was EXTREMELY better performance per dollar Granted they could not ship enough but still The problem isn't AMD it's developers who can't won't get on the wrong side of Nvidia so AMD can't advertise their cards correctly combined with mindshare and a really dumb consumer base Even IT professionals are thoroughly brainwashed AMD simply can't do anything about that situation It isn't their fault though and people like OP feel like Nvidiabot plants
At the same time though even for a core gamer that ONLY cares about gaming and will literally never use NVENC Cuda nvidia broadcast etc all of those features add a considerable amount of value for some and it will likely reflect that in resale value If AMD isn't considerably cheaper than Nvidia for comparable units and you're not the gamer described above as well as planning to use the card to end of life rather than selling and upgrading a few years in or less it's unfortunately an entirely emotional rather than logical decision to go with AMD for your GPU The only thing they can realistically compete on is price Love nvidia or hate them they're not only usually having the highest raw performance but also just absolutely demolish AMD on software and side features If someone even casually wants to stream for example there's no real alternative to nvidia that isn't a significantly worse experience or configuration for example Same thing for anyone that needs Cuda machine learning etc FWIW I hate this not celebrating it but I think that people need to be very real here and AMD needs to hear it If AMD makes a 4080 12GB equivalent that is equal in real world performance but the exact same price that's unfortunately objectively a stupid purchase in most situations
It sounds like Nvidia can t drop the prices tho The margins are too thin for AIBs already AMD is in a good position because their cost for production isn t much more than 6000 series so they could increase and give AIBs better margins but undercut Nvidia a lot But I m still waiting for reviews more than anything else One thing is for sure I m never buying Intel again Went AMD Intel Wow 12th gen is so bad
Jensen has taken a huge dump on NVIDIA s mindshare if you follow the consensus in r NVIDIA
The blower cooler on the 290X was fucking trash though lets be honest
Hey what happened to Hairworks anyway Was it ever used beyond Tomb Raider and The Witcher
For me it has always been drivers especially OpenGL But I hear that is fixed now
The secret ingredient is corporate propaganda
AMD had great generations in the past The 9700pro 5850 and RX480 were all extremely competitive GPUs priced right that gamers embraced It just hasn't happened super recently but it certainly could I completely agree with the OP Undercut Nvidia and win our hearts back Ada GPUs are huge and expensive to produce AMD could screw Nvidia to the wall this gen I hope they do
This time it'll be the latest Cyberpunk 2077 special RT mod that nukes performance on all non RTX40 cards and makes almost no visual difference Digital Foundry will claim it's the best thing since god invented oxygen so everyone must completely ignore older Nvidia and all AMD cards and rush to the store to buy a RTX40
If the choice is between two similarly priced products but one is more feature rich with no obvious drawbacks why pick the other option
Those things you mentioned were valid points Nvidia got them AMD did not NVidia simply invests much more to mainly software features That's a fact
Tbf In my work area u basically need nV products since amd gives no shit about Ue or unity workloads or HLSL developement
Well encoding works well now who gives a fuck about hairworks blower coolers are horrible and neither AMD nor Nvidia uses them anymore so I guess the only thing left for AMD to do is to up their RTX game which they promised to do with Radeon RX7000 so let's see how this goes
that would be touted by nVidia adjacent media and bloggers Pretty lame way to try and dismiss a lot of valid complaints Maybe AMD should just do better
You didn't give a great example though AMD has been steadily gaining CPU marketshare from Intel and they're simply killing it in the DIY market
People stick with Nvidia because they objectively have the better products with a long list of advantages that wasn't the situation with intel I think it's slowly changing but it's gonna take more than a 10 price difference to sway people away
To be fair we constantly hear about how bad AMD drivers Vega 56 constantly crashed I want to support amd but that Vega 56 was a headache
nVidia fanboy here EVGA has headed for the door and so am I Fingers crossed for Team Red
If they don't significantly undercut Nvidia people will still buy Nvidia just like previous gen People will argue that the small premium for an Nvidia is worth it and they may be right
True but Nvidia might not actually have that much room to lower the 40 series prices If rumors are to be believed RDNA 3 might be a lot cheaper to produce than Ada so they could probably undercut them a bit while maintaining decent margins Whether the price difference will be enough to convince gamers to leave the Nvidia ecosystem is a different story though
People want cheap GPUs Most consumers aren't fanboys and will buy the more compelling product offering If AMD simply matches Nvidia in price and performance they aren't going to capture market share Maybe their goal isn't to grow the GPU division but to remain static We don't know what their strategy is But if it is to grow then they need to differentiate themselves from the competition somehow whether that's in terms of price or performance see their Ryzen strategy Another RDNA2 type offering won't cut it in a no longer supply constrained market
But if they didn't plan on doing the same thing as nvidia then they didn't plan to keep producing the 6000 series they planned to do what they always do to replace the previous gen so if they don't produce it anymore then they have nothing to compete with the 3000 series now if the 7000 series compete with the 4000 series in performance and they just increase the price to make profit Then they have nothing to compete with the 3000 series I think they would sell a lot more if the 7000 series compete with the nvidia 4000 series but they replace and price it as the 6000 series Or would people still just buy nvidia
you can get a 6700xt nitro for 420 right now probably best value atm
It all depends what features they can offer The raw speed of Nvidia is already damned impressive and if their ray tracing and dlss is all they promised then AMD has a lot to compete with and if they don t have that then they need to charge less You are right wanting the cheap AMD to get the cheap Nvidia Unless the AMD under 400 is way more competitive I am going to wait for Nvidia to drop their prices
Is oled useful when you have to clamp the color space to srgb anyway You either get accurately depicted colors in an extended color range but only for color managed applications while everything else like games has poorer color reproduction or you just clip the color space so everything else looks right Or something it's complicated and I don't fully understand it Basically unless an artist gives you an image set up in a color managed program like Photoshop using a color profile calibrated to the monitor then the image will not be more vibrant in a realistic way your monitor will be displaying colors in the extended color spa e OLED supports despite those colors not matching what you would see with your eye A human configures things like how the game looks or how to tweak the photo they do this in srgb space because 99 999 of people viewing their content are in srgb space so when you take an image designed inside srgb and tell a wide gamut monitor to display it it stretches the colors out a dull red in real life will look dull red on a srgb clamped monitor but will look bright neon red on a wide gamut monitor it's using an extended color space yes but its not more accurate its showing more colors but they wont match reality as close as clamping it to srgb I have a 10 bit wide gamut monitor and after days of research the answer was to use the amd drivers to clamp the output to srgb My monitor can display colors outside of srgb but there's effectively zero content you can find that accurately uses that color space
Buyers Will the vast majority of us still buy Nvidia even when AMD is offering faster products Yes Yes we will Happened several times in the past and likely will again
nvidiots lower your rdna3 prices amd so i can x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B the rtx4000 at a reasonable price
Gaining market mind share would be about maximizing long term profits
And increasing market share is a step towards that
Do you bleed your customers today just so Nvidia can claim them back tomorrow People need to stop getting into the marketing game if they can't understand business is more than just the current fiscal year Nvidia wants to bleed the customers dry and that signals to me that they don't have a future plan and need to cash in Maybe they'll figure it out later but not before they lose a significant market chunk Either that or they're just stupid and making their bad will public knowledge
They absolutely can keep the prices rx 6000 msrp stable or just correct them for inflation A higher Radeon market share would profit the ecosystem with better optimization from developers and it could be seen as marketing for the future If both brands ordered too much tsmc capacities falling prices would be just a matter of time anyways And if we are being honest nvidia does have a raytracing and proprietary ecosystem advantage even if it doesn't matter for every buyer
It's a valid point but it doesn't mean much The OP framed it badly with the greedy vs stupid and market share argument In the long term AMD will benefit from having more presence in the market and offering compelling prices is a way to achieve it That's a matter of projections based on production capacity and past performance
If AMD releases cards with the same performance AND price as NV they cannot possibly expect people to buy AMD If they are the same price perf the choice is NV If they are lower perf than NV at a competitive price the choice is either but most likely NV If they are same perf but lower price the obvious choice is AMD
AMD is a publicly traded company you know they have to do everything to maximize its profits or face repercussions from their overlords Capitalism demands it Capitalism demands consumers do everything in their power to get more for less money Capitalism isnt just defend company It is also defend customer What you are doing is giving excuses to the company Fair enough 50 of capitalism right there Good Now get the other 50 and DEMAND more for your money
Not they dont The dominant theory is Freeman's stakeholder theory You'd be right 20 years ago when shareholder theory was still dominant
That's not how managing a company works Differentiating a product to sell more of said product is how you grow a business Some investors are content with current performance and don't expect growth But most would like to see their investment grow AMD is not a market leader in the GPU space so I'd be shocked if shareholders opposed a strategy that would increase their market share and by extension long term financial performance AMD doesn't lose money by selling more of their product The returns would be the same more product sold at lower margins Once they've grown the business and taken a lead in the market in terms of performance and mind share they can then raise prices see their Ryzen strategy for an example
Am not downvoting you but my argument is that the market these days seems to be trading more on forward looking statements than anything else If AMD can produce a well priced competitor that is undercutting Nvidia and performs close to their cards then from a forward looking statement point of view AMD can claim that they are aiming to build sustainable market share increases quarter over quarter That by itself would work to boost AMD s share price at next earnings over bumper profits any day
3090 tis were selling out for 3500 while the 6900xt was 1500 max At this point AMD is unfortunately still what AMD was in cpu before Ryzen The average consumer just ignores a pc when they don't see nvidia graphics
As someone that usually buys Nvidia this is not the case for me
Some probably do Me personally in recent years I do feel Nvidia was worth a small not hundreds of dollars price premium due to DLSS and better driver quality With FSR2 DLSS2 is no longer a major competitive advantage DLSS3 remains to be seen
Yeah lots of people refuse to believe that AMD cards perform to their counterparts while being cheaper It is true that their drivers are wonky but it's usually still very good
Because NVidia cards give more value in other ways Better drivers better upscaling DLSS better RT performance better performance for professionals CUDA etc
RTX ON LETS GOOOO BABY smiling face with sunglassessmiling face with sunglasses
don't forget 3090 1499 6900XT 999 even during the shortage people were still buying 3080 3090 1600 2200 when the 6900XT was around 1300 which was around the price of the 3070 which people were also still buying
Maybe this is a EU only problem but did you forget the actual prices of AMD Nvidia cards This is the price history for PowerColor Radeon RX 6900XT Ultimate in Europe Estonia It only took them 2 years to get close to msrp I would've gladly bought the 6900XT for msrp or something remotely close and I am not going to pay full price now for an old card Now I'm just waiting to see what AMD will do and if that disappoints then I'll just get the cheapest used 6900XT 3080Ti
sadly I agree and this time the DLSS 3 0 is a nice feature
AMD mindshare has changed these past few years
Depends on the performance
The mentality that the company making the absolute fastest product is able to bring some of that performance down is what people normally see Like with car companies
People bought 1200 3080s In a mining Craze
More funny people bought 3060s for 1200 bucks upwards
Still people rather bought 3070s for 1800 bucks instead of a 1300 6900XT
I make less than the median income and not in a high price area like California or anything and I still got a 6800xt Certainly not rich here but I don't go out to eat or have lots of other expenses that people draw simply because my hobbies are different Putting money aside or making time for people or hobbies is a personal decision
Also don't convince yourself you need stuff you don't
Nvidia is focused in catering AI ML market and leave retail gaming market to AMD to handle
Not this time people ain't buying old 3000 rtx series stocks for new rdna3 as long as it matches price to performance
Why would they be so close when they're already much cheaper this current gen Here the 3090 is 1800aud vs the faster 6900xt which is 1000aud lol 80 premium still
What I would give for anti monopoly laws to extend to functional monopolies A duopoly in which one player has 80 of the market is functionally a monopoly even if legally it keeps the player out of the government's reach
Yep this is what they d say if they didn t have to worry about PR Why would they allocate expensive wafers to make gamurr cards when they could print money by making Zen 4 chiplets The margins are massive on the CPU side They don t have the brand value or software stack in place on the GPU side to get fat margins like Nvidia does
Because of mindshare and great marketing by nVidia
It's debatable that the 16gb is a true 4080 It's not the top die They have done this before in the past of course but compared to 30 series it's a massive downgrade I think everyone is focusing on the 12gb 4080 scam and ignoring the massive gap between 4090 and 4080 3090 to 3080 was what 2000 CUDA cores Now it's a 6000 core gap crazy
It's rare to see people like you that understand the fact that Nvidia has the market cornered in way more places than just gaming They could sell no GPUs to gamers and would probably still hold the majority market share due to the vast amount of other workloads Nvidia GPUs handle easily but AMD struggles with or is outright abysmal at Businesses and enterprises give no shits about the increase in pricing because they know what they're getting is the best for the work they're doing AMD is good at one thing rasterization I would love to buy an AMD GPU but I don't purely game and the majority of the market share has this same mindset Despite that hardware surveying still shows a vast majority of gamers are running Intel Nvidia A tremendous amount actually AMD is barely in the race You can downvote me all you want but I'm not fanboying I'm speaking publicly accessible facts Edit I'm actually hoping that AMD steers away from this single minded outlook on GPU performance as it's not all about frames win games I know this is an Nvidia slogan but that seems to be AMDs largest focus that's the mindset to have if you want to hand all the real money to your competition If AMD came out with cards that not only killed it in rasterization but also swept Nvidia under the rug in all the other categories that people look to Nvidia for then I'd change my tune but I don't see that happening with RDNA3 either sadly
People want performance they can afford AMD does deliver the same rasterization performance at all levels of sane consumer options Hell AMD even captures the shitty and not worth it bottom section all on their own
You are completely valid Not to mention the nvidia broadcast features plus the new cards have dual AV1 encoders There are perfectly valid reasons other than raster perf for buying an nvidia card over AMD
I forget the name of the tech but some AMD gpu's when combined with an AMD CPU boost their gaming performance by a decent degree Like 20 fps It's honestly the reason I'll be going full AMD next build That and the better prices
I thought AMD came out and personally made a Twitter post stating that pricing is going to be the same with RDNA3 as it was with RDNA2 If what you're saying is confirmed then it likely won't be worth it for me or anyone else who isn't already an AMD fanboy who doesn't care about the QoL tech and features you get with the competition to move over to AMD unless they can actually beat out Nvidia that win will require them to implement hardware level ray tracing deep learning too though as rasterization performance is nice but when it comes to real time rendering modeling and other forms of workloads that aren't strictly render X game AMD is light years behind because they don't have that kind of tech on their cards Hell even Intel whenever they actually launch the A770 A750 have that tech on their cards and are looking to sell at a MSRP over three times lower then the competition I know at this point they'll be a full generation behind but having access to ray tracing and DL technology alone would be worth it That's honestly the only thing keeping me from going AMD at this point though I don't want to sacrifice all those features just to have a card that MIGHT beat out Nvidia in gaming but is terrible for everything else Edit AMDs hand will eventually be forced to implement new AI tech that allows those features to be enabled at the hardware level on their cards as ultimately we're looking at the entirety of the industry starting to heavily utilize it Why continue to stay steps behind for the sake of designing a GPU that can only handle one of the many workloads that GPUs are used for across the industry That just seems like a very unwise move as they'll continue to fall behind
They are greedy but not as greedy as Intel or Nvidia when we're talking about hardware Absolutely not greedy about software products though
They are a billion dollar corporation Of course they're greedy
it definitely seems like 12 is an average age of the most users in this thread
That literally makes no sense Fsr 2 1 is helpful to everyone except for nvidia 3000 users since they get access to dlss 2 0
How often do you go into the drivers menu
Had the same issues with NV cards The Software is what actually will keep me with AMD GPUs it's just light years ahead UI wise
then why you think nVidia cards are too expensive They are the only CUDA provider in town Just pay up man Since when video cards for gamers require CUDA to function
I switched to RDNA2 6800XT after 17 years exclusively using NV cards and I won't go back I could get the card in summer 21 for 800 bucks which just wasn't possible for any Ampere card with the same level of raster performance the driver UI is so much better and stream lined with AMD I had zero issues so far
AMD will be a fool if they did that Undercutting that hard nVidia will retaliate with lower prices Eventually AMD will lost money with no market share gain That is a time tested fact from many previous generations
90 of video card buyers never use CUDA for anything else yet it is the feature they must have when shopping video cards They also argue online about this incredible CUDA cores as they actually know how to use
In a professional environment I agree for pure gaming however the offer almost the same FSR2 is on the same level as DLSS but doesn't require dedicated Hardware why should you implement DLSS which is harder to do and only runs on NV GPUs when FSR does the same and runs on any modern GPU It's a no brainer The only downside until now was the poor RT performance but I'm quite confident we will at least see ampere level of RT horsepower in RDN3 which is sufficient in most cases
FSR 2 is already on the same level as DLSS 2 and it's easier to implement runs on ever GPU from the last 3 gens
You realize how many years have passed since GCN I have a 6800XT and there have been no major inconveniences so far
They can still increase profits Just hopefully not 400 for a single tier in one generation 4080 12gb is actually a 4070 for a 400 increase over 3070
I'm planning the same combo but doing the 5800 CPU and 6700x gpu
I bet 6950xt is already close to the 4070 scam card I wouldn't worry about that
Corporate scalper the best precise description of Ngreedia
All of this quality talk and no mention of performance You mentioned perception packaging pricing branding and myriad other attributes and never once mentioned the word performance when describing characteristics driving purchasing choice
NVs N4 is just a customized N5 from TSMC so yeah they are both on the same node basically
At those prices 1400 for a 4080 and 1100 for a 4070 in Europe nothing except the tiny stock of FE cards will sell out instantly If AMD doesn't Undercut big time they'll miss a chance of a Lifetime
6700XT which is same speed or faster 6800 if you want a fat margin ahead
Well imagine in 2 4 years time of those prices a GPU will cost you more than your whole rig A console would be the only option then for normal earners
RX 6950XT would be the closest punch for punch
Well those cards are out there for more than 2 years if you are still surprised by RNDA2s bad RT performance its oyur own fault Older games that use DX9 or opengGLare also know for not running as good on AMD cards They have however stepped up their performance for such conditions significantly over the past months RDNA3 will likely have at least RT performance on Ampere level which is sufficient im already using RT on my 6800XT and games like Metro Exodus or Quake 2 RT are a blast to experience with RT
My favorite is The bar was so low it was practically a tripping hazard in Hell yet here you are limbo dancing with the devil
It's basically my reacting to every Microsoft Surface event in the last 2 years
There re also reports that RDNA 3 doesn t have much higher production costs compared to RDNA 2 They could probably have massive profit margins with a 750 6800xt a 500 6700xt etc
How are you on the AMD subredding and so dramatically misunderstand what rebrand means The 4070 isn't rebranded anything The 4070 has never existed There will undoubtedly be a card called a 4070 at some point and it isn't a card that Nvidia announced this week Previously 500 can you direct me to where I could have bought an RTX 4070 for 500 What you are calling a rebrand was leakers pulling bullshit out of their arses Did they rebrand the 800W power requirements too
I don't think the shareholders would agree with you
They need to undercut nVidia by more than 50 150 300 would be nice This is one of the very few instances AMD has had over the past decade that they can afford to seriously undercut nVidia The last time it happened was 4870 4850 and it was a major success
I also want to get a card that doesn't sound like its architecture isn't named after a porn star YES I KNOW WHO THE ACTUAL LOVELACE IS BUT THERE'S A PORN STAR THAT SHARES THE SAME LAST NAME
even undercutting by 150 is still barely anything since nvidia's prices are already so ludicrous
A shareholder would absolutely want the chance for their company to gain market share over upsetting existing customers Profit per unit is not the only way to achieve best interests This is surely AMD's chance to have another Ryzen2 moment but this time against Nvidia
This is sort of an urban legend Yes they can be sued if they don't do what's in the best interest of their shareholders They can also be sued for doing what's in the best interest of their shareholders They can also be sued for being aliens from the planet Krypton You can sue anyone for anything Nothing stops you They are unlikely to be sued successfully for that In general as long as the board of directors isn't oblivious or self serving they can do damn near whatever they want
They could very easily win the court case if they just basically say need to price low to gain marketshare get sales 99 99 of judges would side with them with how far behind Nvidia sales they are And amd could even point out that it's effectively the ryzen strategy vs intel that has done them so well in the cpu market
They just need a better pricing
Except some data indicates they don't have it Instead they have 10
7800XT at 750 would be bloody murder Come on AMD do it
AMD won't be winning a generation in the GPU market as long as Nvidia has DLSS CUDA and other stuff that a lot of people want regardless of cost Nevermind that most people buying a GPU PC don't even know that there's anything other than Nvidia
They also require less exotic cooling systems so it's a 3 pronged reason to their advantageous manufacturing costs
This Smaller chips are cheaper Smaller chips gets better yield Chiplets allows AMD to use partially faulty chips more easily AMD can produce for cheaper and will throw away few chips Don't Be Greedy
TBF it sounds like packaging is going to be more complicated getting 7 Chiplets onto a die without defects but we really dont know the relative cost of these things to make a fair call Never the less I certainly don't expect them to charge more than NV but I think they're going to slot into the large pricing gaps left by NV so everyone gets to make money and not step on toes or trigger a price war 7900xt for 1400 7800xt for 1200 6950xt for 950 they literally just announced price cuts so we know what's up and the rest of the RDNA2 stack down
Also AMD's top card is rumored to be sub 550mm 2 adding up chiplets The 4090 is like 800 mm 2 It'd be amazing if AMD can beat the 4080 16GB with their top card
Yeah MCM Chiplets is what gives me some hope here they should be able to mass produce to the point that they can undercut to a significant degree
Hopefully not crazy power requirements too Id rather not upgrade my psu
Isn't multiple chip design costlier If silicon wafers yields are high that is
Scott Herkelman CVP GM AMD Radeon was asked in an episode of PCWorld's Full Nerd if Sapphire makes AMD's reference GPUs and his answer was NO Thanks T1beriu for finding this So who makes AMD's reference cards It's actually PC Partner Group the company that sells video cards under the ZOTAC brand sapphire doesnt make amds reference cards
Usually the reference cooler is made by Coolermaster just like their CPU heatsinks As for the PCB I'm not sure But AMD dictates BOM cost so if they want to they can use fewer phases less input filtering outputs skip extras like BGA underfill etc
man them 6800xt midnight blacks were schweet
I'm sure they could buy some of that extra allocation from Nvidia
Nvidia is supposedly more than doubling their performance with those cores but there are strings attached to those gains lower prices to really win all of the marbles 1 5x 2x last gen raster performance with a DLSS 1 0 quality FSR meh Raytracing performance and a 1000 price tag ain't going to cut it
Maybe I got lured into nvidia marketing terms but I can and do see the gaming development moves towards frame generation and slowly away from frame rasterization In that case wouldn t tensor cores be more effective and efficient at that sort of task
Performance doesn't scale linearly also those Tensor cores are there for a reason they have lots of benefits GPUs isn't a single purpose product for just gaming Training AI models rendering lots of ways that a GPU is used besides gaming AMD is actually stupidly far behind Nvidia in that area even if they have the hardware the software is severely lacking But that's fine if AMD focuses on gaming of course but then we get to the point of the post AMD simply has to not be stupid and greedy I hope to god AMD nails GPUs for gaming because I could really do with cheaper Nvidia GPUs as well for Neural Network development
They've managed to gain mindshare with Ryzen CPUs in a way that they never did with Radeon which is weird considering that their FX CPUs came from a much more dire position than the likes of the 290X which was pretty good apart from the bad stock cooler
Tbf that was during a pretty huge shortage You couldn't find the 5600X for months for MSRP and it was being scalped to 360 So if they sold it for 250 it wouldn't have helped And once they started making enough they started discounting it And the price increases on the 5900X and 5950X were both quite small 10 and 7 In NVidia's case though supply is 100 not an issue they just want to artificially hold prices up
CUDA man I d kill for a proper viz rendering solution that is GPU agnostic
You are missing OP point or its a chicken and egg story They need to undercut to win market share back even if means less profit
GPUs are sold at fat margins They have plenty of room to undercut and still be profitable
By that logic Ryzen never should have won in price and it was a failure They need lower prices to push through those often inaccurate claims When Ryzen launched the sentiment towards AMD came from Bulldozer That was a MUCH worse situation than the Radeon detractors of today Those CPUs were objective bad They couldn't win many fights at the top for costumers They ran hot as hell and sucked crazy power to attempt to compete They were so hopeless that AMD didn't even offer DIY desktop CPUs at the mid high end for something like 5 years Heck AMD faced lawsuits because of deceptive marketing of their cores because the reality to consumers was so far from expectations Despite that nonsense AMD succeeded greatly with Ryzen They won with products that were close enough on performance sometimes outright better better on power consumption and better on price AMD didn't play it safe on profit margins there They were aggressive and got a crap load of people to switch Now they've upped the margins with a higher install base and better consumer sentiment Pushing through those sentiments will be harder if among the buyer to try their products is really costly
Immagine charging the same amount for way less features the driver fear and other reasons only AMD fan boys will buy them even if they go for 100 less nobody will buy them since when spending 800 on a graphics card you dont want compromises and will gladly pay more for Ngreedia just because its more known for reliability The reason that nobody talks about nvidia pricing is that if you have watched their direct 3 4 of the video was about enterprise and so the pricing is for enterprises not for gamers if AMD prices their line of gpu similar to Nvidia they will be absolute clowns
AMD doesn't have enough wafer supply to satisfy 60 of GPU demand Good prices and good products can only get their market share as far as they can actually produce
Or new cooling lmao
Absolutely AMD needs to exploit any misstep by nVidia they don't make many
Absolutely agree More Mindshare More sales in the future With NV disrespecting every pc gamer with low to mid range wage where the highend SKU costs as much as a whole pc without dedic GPU MacBook used car and charging one grand for their performance SKU mind you up until now every XX60 card had a 256bit bus a lot of potential buyers will strike if AMD can offer them a decent product I think their presentation date and the launch of the cards is precisely planned they wanted to know how good Ada will performe and they wanted to know how much NV is charging and by how much they can Undercut and still get a good margin Im srsly counting on a 500 600 buck bread and butter card by AMD
Ryzen 3000 was absolutely incredible for the price and performance 5000 series was too pricey but definitely delivered the best gaming performance
Ryzen 3000 wasn't really a case of having the best product available EPYC and Threadripper were far stronger For mainstream users like here on Reddit who mostly play games AMD didn't catch up until Zen 3
AMD is a large company they want to exploit the market to the best of their ability just like all the other players However they aren't stupid I hope that they look at this as a Ryzen 3000 generation ie you have arguably the best product available but are still priced aggressively to gain mindshare rather than a Ryzen 5000 generation where they know that their competition isn't really competitive so the prices in every tier creep up and they delay releasing better bang per buck SKUs like the 5700x and 5600 until the latest possible moment The difference here is that AMD had overtaken Intel in the minds of many consumers by the time Zen 3 came out thanks to Zen 2's success so they could afford to price the new CPUs at a premium They have not done that with Radeon yet they're still play catch up They did little to win marketshare and mindhsare with RDNA 2 It was largely overpriced and unavailable while not offering anything over Nvidia in terms of feature set just minor gains in rasterization performance
An annoyingly large amount of people just want AMD to be competitive so that Nvidia can be cheaper so that they can buy Nvidia GPUs Yes its very unfortunate Whatever my next GPU will be it will most likely not be Nvidia Their business practices just seem too greedy to justify any longer
I actually bought a 5700XT early 2020 because it had better performance per euro and hardware unboxed recommended it Turned out the driver issues with multi monitor setups people warned about did happen to me and I think that really harmed the success of this entire aggressive pricing effort because it was a big talking point at the time For me it's obviously just a sample size of 1 and after fighting with drivers for a couple of days I also had the fans on the GPU not spinning anymore from just testing other drivers and just returned it and paid like 80 bucks more for a 2070 super Guess this is more a story than trying to say AMD GPUs bad I think if their drivers and AIB models all were pretty flawless at the time the 5700XT could and would have made a much better impression Really hope the 7700XT can deliver 6900XT performance at 230W max and be sold for around 600 USD MSRP the lowered 6900XT is listed at 699 USD EU always gets the VAT which is around 20 depending on country on top of the US price so even the 4080 12GB which is essentially a 4070 is not 899 euros here but listed starting at 1099 euros here which AIBs will easily take up to 1200 euros or more Spelling all this out I do really think AMD while probably undercutting won't go that much lower sure both 4080 versions are dumb value but the upcoming gen should have really been 3090 performance at 500 bucks max sadly doesn't look like that's
Yeah Nvidia has all these dumb youtubers peddling their free review cards Raytracing actually cripples the framerate of nvidia cards but hey Raytracing is better bro Dollar for dollar radeon is the better deal not even mentioning the adrenaline software that I've been using to one click overclock my card and it doesn't even break a sweat
Does amd have anything to match dlss and other Nvidia exclusives They have ray tracing right
It's not This is a pattern that has been repeating for over 2 decades
G Sync
Exactly The eco system Nvidia built over the years is nothing like when AMD was up against Intel While Intel dominated market share a lot of jobs applications and professionals weren't reliant on using Intel CPUs only With NVIDIA tho it's a different story Too many applications MLs broadcasting encoding 3d rendering and even video gaming favor NVIDIA's cards It's very difficult for AMD to disrupt this chain of eco system AMD vs NVIDIA right now is a lot like asking if Blender will become the industry standard over Maya The biggest reason why Blender even though being a very powerful tool can't be the industry standard is because too many other applications render engines designers students companies already incorporated Maya as THE industry standard If they want to switch to Blender they'd have to abandon all those pipelines in favor of just Blender Which is batshit crazy for any company or workplace That's why Blender is only used among small size Indie developers rather than big AAA size companies AND since bigger companies often use Maya students must learn Maya over Blender So the cycle is complete x200B If AMD wants to compete with NVIDIA they MUST provide alternatives to existing NVIDIA's features If not AMD should just remain as the underdog for the rest of their life in gpu market only sewing modest profit instead of challenging NVIDIA
developers who can't won't get on the wrong side of Nvidia this is a misunderstanding of the relationship between developers and nvidia truth is there is nothing even remotely comparable to the CUDA ecosystem for developers whether it be AMD or not even on paper AMD would need to have something comparable to CUDA to give developers a reason to switch and in practice it would have to be something considerably better to justify changing their whole workflow and migrating all their projects
People who need those feature should always go with nVidia no matter the price because this is not something AMD will be able or care to compete Stop asking AMD for lower price video cards because those features will be there Why should AMD lower price for feature it is not competing AMD only wishes to capture gaming market and it has right to price its video solely on rasterization performance If you need extra features go with nVidia but for rasterization performance only go with AMD for best value simple as that Why pay for those features when you are just a gamer And why ask AMD for lower price when you need AI ML You can not buy AMD card anyway CUDA core is a MUST have for your work and AMD video cards have nothing to offer you Will you ML AI developers ask Honda to lower their civic price when you are shopping for a garbage truck And why are you gamers paying for a garbage truck when you need just a civic
We'll see about that on Oct 12th and November when the 4080 and 4070 12GB launch I hope this was enough to do Jacket Man has gone crazy
GTX 780 blower wasn't that great either but people only remember Hawaii blower for some reason
Why did you get a blower cooler Who buys the reference design
Entire 2xx 3xx gens were not that great It was a dark period before RX480 came out
Looked sweet though
I switched it back to my older GPU but my Phenom 2 X4 system was named lawnmower on the network And it wasn't from the noise of the CPU cooler That's not really a fair comparison though The 290X was much more shrill like a dental drill Lawnmower was a better name
Reminds me of this classic v u5YJsMaT AE
No one can deny that AMD drivers have been a mixed bag for years Hell I remember during a good chunk of the time GPUs were made separately by ATI even just getting drivers on their site was a huge pain in the ass Things have improved a lot and AMD has considerably better Linux support something I suspect is going to become very important over the next few years
I went from dual HD5770s bought one at launch another a year later for half off to an RX480 at launch and I'm just waiting for that next
DLSS 3 0 is actually a clever thing people who buy top end GPUs rarely care about real performance they care about the number they see in the top left corner of their screens or right side depends on the preferences So this ersatz SVP for games gives them exactly that they can claim victory over peasants in benchmarks meanwhile real life latency of such soap opera magicks is the same as it is without it enabled or even worse if it requires several frames prerendered in advance
Digital Foundry the same outlet that tried to justify rtx 2000's ass raytracing by saying it looks good on a CRT display
Freesync used to be a legitimate system selling feature for AMD before Nvidia adopted it Gsync compatible As it stands the only real selling point for Radeon is excellent Linux support and more VRAM per dollar The VRAM thing is a mixed bag since the applications that benefit the most from 16GB of VRAM AI rendering tend to benefit from Nvidia CUDA
Because they usually won't be similarly priced and for most users have equivalent features AMD tends to support cross GPU compatible features and Nvidia actively does the Nvidia is the leader in a 2 competitor 'll charge
Even a slightly more expensive product with notably more features actually used implemented features much better drivers SW quality history The choice is obvious
Those things you mentioned were valid points Nvidia got them AMD did not Nor did the games
Even if they don't actually improve their RT itself 7950XT will be minimum 3x better than the 6900XT simply by virtue of having 3x the TMUs should really be minimum 6x better since 3x TMUs 2x clocks That's all assuming no improvement at all which I'd be surprised if that's the case even a modest 20 improvement per TMU that still adds up to 720 6900XT to 7950XT
By releasing some fucked up proprietary shit of their own How about hell no
AMD does pretty well FSR Resizable BAR which is actually amazing in performance improvements with just one toggle power efficiency and overall great performance anyway You can spend less on an RX 6000 GPU and achieve near the picture quality and performance of DLSS with FSR 2 1 without any of the special Tensor core work RTX GPUs do for DLSS to work
It only took Intel being extra complacent for years before Ryzen and not being able to catch up for years without turning their processors into room heaters again Intel switch didn t happen overnight It s more like they fucked up enough for Intel fanboys to second guess themselves Nvidia switch is a lot tougher nut to crack because they at least didn t fuck up in ways that Intel did technology is good but they are just too damn greedy
Intel was delivering shit products Something that helped shift mind share Nvidia in the other hand since 1080ti has been pushing great products in the Nvidia way
Yeah even Ryzen 1 was able to beat Intel in multi core by virtue of actually offering 8 core CPUs at consumer prices Ryzen won out due to similar or better performance combined with significant undercutting
ive had an rx 480 5700xt and currently have a 6700xt and 5700 The only time ive ever had driver issues was a Nvidia 965m laptop gpu
Give it a shot again when you get a chance Last stint I had with Radeon cards 5700XT it was pretty good Although I'm told newer cards just aren't able to undervolt as well as they used to so that's kind of worrisome
They always have to price competitively or people won't buy We won't see anything like a return to pre pandemic pricing though They'll claim inflation but both companies expanded their staffing significantly over the past two years in a way that isn't sustainable unless demand and price stays high
If they don't significantly undercut Nvidia people will still buy Nvidia just like previous gen If they do significantly undercut Nvidia Nvidia lower prices in response and people will say thanks AMD and still buy Nvidia This has happened time and time again over the last 15 years
I actually just read the news about AMD lowering MSRP For 6000 series I've gained a lot of faith after the news if they planned have bonkers MSRP for 7000 then they wouldn't lower the price of 6000
Actually the raw power is not impressive people did the math and it's underwhelming AMD doesn't have a hard time to beat them in raster they should focus on raw power and not cheaping out on vram and it should be better than some pixelated and laggy dlss
OLED is mainly about infinite contrast and fast pixel response not about a wide colour gamut
Is oled useful when you have to clamp the color space to srgb anyway Yes I switched from IPS to OLED last year and the difference was astronomical I'd classify it as maybe the best gaming related upgrade I've ever made LCD panels come nowhere close to the black levels on OLED HDR performance also blows any LCD panel out of the water And of course OLED doesn't suffer from light bleed In the past I've always been disappointed by how console games often look better than my PC games despite running at lower FPS with lower fidelity settings solely because they were being run on my TV rather than a monitor Monitor technology is so far behind TV technology it's depressing but also understandable since it's such a small market
It's more like products that trade blows for 50 less than Nvidia while having a way worse feature set They need to actually undercut
Faster but worse overall experience
Faster doesn t mean much if the overall experience blows When s the last time NVidia released a driver that slowed you down
Buyers Will the vast majority of us still buy Nvidia even when AMD is offering faster products Yes Yes we will Happened several times in the past and likely will again Do you have any examples
But it's not You need to make your investors clap every quarter That is why in a sense Nvidia is doing what is doing
You clearly don't understand markets and shareholding then Market share is not a guaranteed profit maximizer so AMD is not going to focus on it
Its about the next earnings
Fiscal year Try quarter Earnings calls and quarterly performance is super short sighted The sooner they get away from that the sooner they can make decisions that are actually beneficial beyond 3 months
Nvidia wants to bleed the customers dry and that signals to me that they don't have a future plan and need to cash in Perhaps they project greatly slowing future generation demand Similar to phones being good enough that few people feel the compulsion to upgrade as often as when smartphones first came out
Yes they absolutely gouge their customers today and deal with the issues later They have done this repeatedly over the last 2 years As has Nvidia The only one not really doing it is intel funny enough and that s only because they lost an enormous amount of sex appeal over the last 4 years And because Pat was determined to turn the ship around Amd is in a leader position according to mind share and will price things at a premium I imagine they will be cheaper than Nvidia but don t expect them to be Cheap
If AMD releases cards with the same performance AND price as NV they cannot possibly expect people to buy AMD If they are the same price perf the choice is NV If they are lower perf than NV at a competitive price the choice is either but most likely NV If they are same perf but lower price the obvious choice is AMD NV corrected the last one for you because if that were true there's no way in hell would a gtx1050 ti gtx 1060 and gtx 1650 not even a fucking Super dominate the steam hardware survey if the world works like your dreamland
6900XTs were going for 3060 prices in mining boom people still bought 3060s for 1200 instead of a top end AMD GPU lmao
Those 3090s were bought for mining though And AMD's cards were bad at mining compared to Nvidia The amount of people who bought a GPU at 2000 or more for gaming are a tiny tiny amount The 3090 only has a third of the marketshare on Steam compared to a 3080 and they both get crushed by 3070 and 3060s
Thats mainly because one of those was good for mining and the other wasnt We had people swapping 6700xt and cash or direct 1 1 for 5700xts because they didnt have bus width slashed
The average consumer Are you saying they are dumb
That's a beast of a card veeery tempted to grab one soon as prices drop even more Only thing is I have a shit PSU so would also need to upgrade that too lol my other option is waiting for an efficient 7600xt but who knows how long that'll be
Okay so did you buy an AMD card Which one did you buy
You are the exception then Ive had people who I know in real life whose computer was built by me pass on the offer of a zero cost upgrade from a 2070 to a 6700 XT and instead demand to pay a silly amount for a 3070 Those people respect me enough to build them machines but not enough on that matter I mocked em even but they still got their 3070 P
DLSS was revolutionary and definitely swayed me to go RTX but I would be surprised if DLSS3 is anywhere close to being as revolutionary If AMD knock it out of the park with RDNA3 I'm probably going to switch just out of principle because Nvidia can honestly do one with how they've approached their latest release
Better drivers Idk didnt notice any difference after switching from 1070 Ti to 6900XT it just works The reality is Both can mess their drivers up quite badly and nowadays AMD is not the AMD from 10 years ago Better RT performance Yes but it is still not a widely adopted technology especially since the consoles cant really deal with it So at least to me that is no buy argument at the moment in a few years yes Any current RT capable card will be too slow by then anyway so why bother with it now DLSS I have not run into situations with my 6900XT where I would have needed it but yeah AMD is a bit behind here but progress is there And I expect something like DLSS with RDNA3 given that FSR2 is not bad
The drivers aren't really any better but I agree with the rest You actually need a geforce experience account to get the latest Nvidia drivers Also their Linux drivers are terrible the AMD ones are much better
Is RT even worth it at anything below 3080 anyways
These were the reasons I went with a 3080 over a 6900xt
Also green is a more soothing color than red tbh
Better Windows drivers Maybe subjective now Better Linux Steam deck drivers No absolutely not Imagine pressing the Start button and there's lag in desktop animations DLSS Guess what I bought a RTX 2080 thinking DLSS would be good only about 5 games had DLSS within the 2 years of release How many games do you think will support DLSS 3 in the next 12 months It would be better than DLSS 1's adoption rate but you are not likely to see many titles
1 Stability yes although AMD has made massive strides Nvidia UI looks like Win 95 Stability problems with my 6800xt were isolated to bad PC Memory not VRam and later a bad HDMI cable 2 Debatable 3 Agreed but again Nvidia is a generation ahead here I think we ll be surprised by AMD this generation 4 Clear win by Nvidia
Price history of the 3070 is 1600 1900 bucks down to 700 800 which is still 400 above MSRP Stop being apologetics for Nvidia
I think what he meant is that people were willing to spend even more an scalped Nvidia cards than on less scalped AMD ones
Do you even know what dlss 3 0 does I didn't know I too believed it to be good but it turns out it's not so great
Not for video cards
You mean like people buying 5700xts for 1200 during the mining era
No one was buying 3070 for 1800 As usual you won t be able to back that fact ip
That's not AMD's fault though
Because one was a money printer and the other wasn't People traded 5700xt owners 6700xts and sometimes cash for their better mining card
I don't know about y'all but I never saw an in stock 6000 series in my country Australia AMD clearly prioritized the Ryzen parts with their 7N space which makes sense because it's their most popular line of products They still sold every 6000 series they made but Nvidia made a lot more 3000 series because they didn't have to balance fab space across multiple product lines
I feel obligated to come here with the international remark that the US is not representative of Steam's and the rest of the world economy For too many people a 3060 is top tier and a luxury item
You have to remember that Internationally GPU prices are usually USA price country tax import tax which honestly sucks and the dollar values even more
Of course there will be a guy who says a BuT I DID iTclown face Not everyone lives in US where salaries are higher and prices are lower Gaming is not a priority for majority of people
A gamer will not switch to Linux and with windows 11 you can literally use Linux on the side now
Windows is still better for gaming though and I have Game Pass for PC so my gaming PC is staying on Windows I'd love to switch for my upstairs computer setup laptop with screen removed but I use a Fresco Logic USB to HDMI adapter for my second screen My first screen is hooked to the HDMI port Unfortunately Fresco Logic has decided that they won't make Linux drivers and they'll make the open source community do all the work for them so I only have one screen on Linux
Mindshare definitely Great marketing They definitely know their target audience and how to market to them A lot of their fanboys grew up and got jobs in IT some of them are purchasing managers and swallowed up all bullshit claims about GPGPU that came from Nvidia Caveat GPGPU itself is not bullshit but a lot of what Nvidia claimed is including how CUDA has better performance than other platforms and is easier to program than other GPGPU APIs
3080 3090ti was all the same die Now 4080 12 16 and 4090 are on three seperate dies The shader gap between 12 and 16 4080s is larger than the gap between 3080 and 3090ti
Yeah I could see that argument being made Let s just say this is the worst launch ever They are really sticking it to us given the massive fuck over they did to us last time around selling to miners
The cheaper alternative is to run two AC in the room to 60f
True but 3080 performed very close to a 3090 for its price
Yeah for sure The tech is called Smart Access Memory if I am not mistaken I thought about going full AMD but the Intel chips are a little better for productivity And since only the Intel compatible boards were available in white when I planned the build that pushed my decision to go Intel CPU But if I upgrade my home PC next I will be going full AMD if the reviews show the new CPUs are good
In that sense so are you the cost of your PC can feed a family of 4 poor members for around 6 to 10 months in undeveloped part of the world Is your PC more valuable to you than that
I'm talking about lack of access to dlss 3 to older GPUs in comparison to updates to fsr by amd for all for free
Relatively often I Love tweaking settings to get the Most out of my Game
Yeah ofc ofc but didnt you read about the upcoming DLSS 3 boost which could be about 2 4x the speed of the current DLSS Games with DLSS 3 will get a massive boost Now AMD needs to improve FSR massively to compete and I hope they do
I got it when it was new Being sufficient isn't actually true whwb the goalpost has moved and more demanding titles popup
I m not holding expectations for RDNA3 announcement because too many expect AMD to overshadow Nvidia in performance
Because gaining market share fans loyal customers etc is forward thinking Its long term growth at the expense of a few premium pennies now They have but a few windows of opportunity to literally equal juggernauts in their space because of the missteps of said juggernauts ala Intel They could have charged even MORE on the CPU side but didn't initially NOW look at their stock price and CPU market share
That's exactly what Executives think The market will bear what it will bear It really calls BS on the idea that companies will regulate themselves or will do what makes sense for the long term survival of an industry Nvidia doesn't make most of their money in the consumer GPU space anymore For God's sake they are charging 900 for a 70 class GPU It would be really great if AMD would do the right thing but I'm not going to count on it
One justification for keeping their prices dramatically lower would be to steal huge amounts of market share from NVIDIA in the GPU sector the way they did in server CPUs However if they can't meet production to answer increased demand at that lower price then it doesn't benefit them to price that aggressively I'm excited to see their math on this
if AMD prices are high like Nvidia I will not upgrade don't have much time to game anyway
They released Ryzen at a great affordable price to get some market share and a minor price increase since then It's still good price compared to the alternative I think OP is right a lot of gamers TM won't want to try an AMD card if it's within 50 of their known trusty Nvidia card If they can get the prices to get people on the fence that will be a great help
Because then people will just buy NVIDIA I don't like it but then they're the same similar price that's what people do
Because chances are people don't bite Nvidia's high prices If AMD were to price just below them they'd not only look dumb and greedy they'd loose an opportunity to gain marketshare and customers Blindly following Nvidia into doing something stupid won't make AMD market leader It just makes them look like a follower and a dumb one at that
Because they won't sell if they price match Nvidia It worked last gen because the mining boom ensured that GPUs of any make and price would sell out instantly Without miners to sell to you're now actually competing to sell your product and unless AMD outperforms Nvidia by a wide margin or they price they cards significantly lower than Nvidia they're going to have a hard time clearing inventory Nvidia has the brand advantage and the edge in terms of features better RT performance and DLSS 3 0 If they're the same price with similar rasterization performance most consumers will go with Nvidia as they simply get more for their money
They also priced Zen 3 higher and didn't offer low mid because they could
Buy PS
Keep my computer for longer or buy lower tiers of products I will do a whole build if the price is acceptable I have no need to though I have a relative who could use an upgrade but even my current build is major overkill Instead of doing my own new build and passing my stuff down I might just get a 5800X3D and move my CPU to him while getting him an ITX board like he wanted I might skip GPUs altogether or buy him a 6600 instead of getting my own 7800 7900 XT If pricing is bad I spend less not more If I can justify the cost I'll spend as much as I care to afford If pricing sucks I'll get nothing or the bare minimum If 6000 series hadn't been a mess to find I'd have a new video card already The price of these new products is the difference between my spending 3K on two system upgrades or decided ING between getting nothing or spending 500 or so for small upgrades
Unless our video cards straight up die we always have the 3rd option there are a few dozen in my Library I never got around to playing that I've already paid for If AMD decide that trying to make me pay 1100 for a 7800XT is a good scheme I can and will just nope out of the deal I'd like a nice new video card But I don't need one and I sure don't want one 1100 badly Crypto is over Pandemic is over Recession is coming I think Nvidia will have to readjust their prices pretty quickly AMD might as well get ahead and win some marketshare while they're about it
Supply Vs demand If they can't keep up with demand then can do what they want with prices until that stops happening You can't sell more than 100 If they can keep up with demand and exceed if they choose to do so going cheaper is by far the better option to increase market share All they have to do is make a 7700XT for 600 that at least matches the 40 80 and people will flock to them while embarrassing their main competition Now is the time for AMD to Intel Nvidia
If AMD kept prices as is Not insane COVID prices they could take a massive amount of Nvidia customers Sure there's always going to be fanboys but anyone with a small amount of common sense wouldn't pay it especially with the huge power draw of the 4000 series
Seems like a good way to keep their 15 market share
Which imo shows just how dumb those people are They are watching in real time their competetor lose their customers' faith and good will to the point where major partners don't see it as financially worth it to stick with them You straight up get to have someone test drive this idea and leave you wide open for a market share shift Maybe I'm just a stupid lowly pleb but dear God I would be pile driving the competition into the ground if given this open opportunity Especially if I had a product that was at least competitive on par with my competitor's
Not upgrade since next gen is kinda lackluster as far as needing high end gpu s at all Like in all seriousness who even needs double the power of a 3090 as touted by one of the new 4000 s besides actual professionals These newer cards are pretty beastly but there s next to nothing to even flex them on imo so if everyone s being greedy I doubt people will purchase
I'm prepared to buy arc and deal with shit drivers
Why wouldn t AMD just keep prices high too what are you gonna do about it Not meant to be combative that s literally what I think execs and CEO s will think That depends Are they trying to maximize profit now or later Basically if they are going for short term they will keep prices high too If they are going for long term then keeping prices low for adoption helps with developer optimization brand trust and possibly get customers more loyal to them in the long run This means potential for much better profits in the future Keep in mind there is also Intel lurking right behind AMD They may not be a threat now but they could be if you don't take them seriously
Reminder that Intel still has two GPUs that they haven't released If AMD really wants market share they should not only be looking at NVidia but also Intel
If AMD keep prices high everyone will still be buying RTX 30 series
Nvidia already will produce more gpus than they wanted they tried to reduce ordered production capacity for wafers So if AMD would appear with competitive prices and performance in over saturated marked they could leave Nvidia with pants down
Why wouldn t AMD just keep prices high too what are you gonna do about it Not meant to be combative that s literally what I think execs and CEO s will think W 's what Zen and Thread ripper was and it essentially saved the company Fantastic performance vs Price in the CPU market
If they match price parity too close to Nvidia 40 series I think they will just sede ground to Nvidia's Ampere stock Winning move is 30 cheaper than 40 series across the board minimum imo
That's how it works Investors see other side overpricing so they want to get more money and feel justified in doing so
What people do about it is not buying cards staying away from pc gaming I would love for AMD to have atleast half the market regarding desktop gpu s
Not buy anything xd
If amd lowers prices Nvidia does too but then people still buy Nvidia This is amd chance to build some funds and make their scientific computing side stronger I expect a slight undercut only
What everyone should do if the prices are crazy don't buy Stay on your current card for a few more years
Because AMD such when it comes to Market Share They were able to gain ground with Intel because of the low Ryzen pricing strategy at least until the last gen I don't think it's rocket science to say that they should do the exact same thing with their GPUs
AMD currently has no card for the 900 and 1200 price points that Nvidia just introduced If Navi31 can do at least the same 60 increase in raster the 4090 seems to give it would make sense to not give it away for less than the 4080 16GB price They can then sell a cut down chip for 800 that would easily beat the 4080 16GB
AMd can only price high if they can actually compete at the top end Nvidia have really pushed RT performance in ADA so AMD will find it difficult to catch up unless they seriously focused on RT improvements
For one thing AMD has been massively discounting their current stock while Nvidia has been fighting to keep prices high AMD is cutting prices despite not having massive oversupply while Nvidia is holding most prices steady despite having massive oversupply So AMD seems to be aware that sales of their current cards are going to be affected by whatever they have in the pipeline Nvidia is launching a 3090 3090 TI performing card for 900 which is a little under what Nvidia is selling those for Meanwhile AMD's 3090 3090 TI equivalent 6900 XT is priced at 700 AMD is also cutting prices HARD in 6800 and below while Nvidia is not which means AMD likely is going to push out the 7700 XT 7600 XT 7600 a lot faster than Nvidia and it will threaten the pricing of those cards So they can't launch the top of the stack considerably higher
I haven't kept up what's wrong with Microsoft Surface these days
If they have similar or better performance to the 4000 series and the production cost is the same and they increase a bit to give AIBs a better margin they could stomp Nvidia
Lol sure argue semantics It uses a completely different die than the 4080 16GB with very different specs besides the 4GB memory only that the name suggests It uses ADA104 ADA103 is the 4080 16GB GA104 was the 3070 GA103 was the 3080 There will be a 20 performance gap between the 4080 16GB and the 4080 12GB based on specs There was a 20 performance gap between the 3070 and 3080 The gap bewteen two gpus named the same 4080 mirrors in pretty much every way the difference between the 3070 3070ti and 3080 and past xx70 and xx80 just because you'd rather just buy into Nvidias shady intentionally deceitful marketing Cmon It clearly would have been the 4070 in any other generation situation where Nvidia hadn't gone fully insane trying to get rid of their 3000 series overstock and refuse to accept lower profit margins than they got used to during a mining boon that now collapsed It's very clearly intentionally misleading compared to every other generation and they know it and know fanboys like you will defend them for no damn reason Everyone knows this is a xx70 tier product renamed so they can try to justify selling it for 900 All tech tubers reviewers are saying this all social media is saying this everyone but you and Nvidia lol Previously is comparing the gen to gen prices duh You can't just intentionally mislead with established naming and not get called out on it If LG puts out an obvious non OLED successor to their lower tier UQ9000 brand with specs in line with that brand line but just names it a LG C3 and tries to charge C Series OLED prices for 's real name should be
You must be blind if you don t see how 4080 12gb is 4070
Actually it is 4080 12GB has the same reference number used in the last years xx70's cards
The fanboys will bail out Nvidia every time AMD didn't break Nvidia's dominance even with Evergreen HD 5000 and Northern Islands HD 6000 when Nvidia had Fermi FERMI for crying out loud Yes that Fermi which was more expensive hotter higher power and lower performance and where even the 500 series rework didn't help it Best AMD managed was 45 When Nvidia announced Kepler 600 series which was better than Fermi though not by much barely matching Northern Islands for much more money and AMD had Southern Islands HD 7000 series which was vastly better and you know what happened AMD lost market share The fanboys will bail out Nvidia every time

This Fiduciary duty doesn't mean what most people think it means In the context of a publicly held corporation it does NOT mean 'you have to maximize short term profits each and every quarter at the expense of all else because make more money is what I say is in my best interest' It means that you make a fully informed business decision to maximize shareholder value and shareholder value is a subjective term What is more valuable maximizing short term profit at the expense of long term market share and even more profit or sacrificing short term profit for long term market dominance Well that depends on the individual shareholder now doesn't it If I as a shareholder want my investment to grow the most over time it would be the latter If I as a shareholder am just interested in short term swing trades and gains then it's the former Usually these types of lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty either fail or they're because the board or the CEO is taking the company in a direction that is blatantly devaluing the company or the suit itself is never meant to go to trial its meant to be enough of a pain in the ass to the board to get them to settle usually by allowing the activist investor or investor group to get people they want into a seat or 2 on the board
FSR is worse than DLSS but it caught up 2 generations in the mean time sure Nvidia is going to 3rd gen dlss but AMD could hit that and surpass it this generation CUDA is meaningless its just a core structure RT cores I'd have given your point merit
Yeah I mean I am fine with AMD kicking nvidia at the highest end possible just dont make the normal cards stupid just as nvidia did 900 4070 in disguise
Don't let this distract you from the fact the die size is only 300 and 380mm on the 4080s that is around the same size of the 1080 and 1070
Also on cheaper nodes really no excuse to not severely undercut
tbh I dont think AMD will get away with these prices in a recession just as much as nvidia
make money and not step on toes or trigger a price war I actually think this is the perfect time for AMD to trigger the price war because Nvidia is caught with an oversupply GPU demand is down AMD cards should be a lot cheaper to make AMD revenue is more diversified
We will see I hope we will eat well on November 3rd nvidia really needs some beating after the recent years
4090 is 608mm
The 4090 is like 800 mm 2 You couldn't be bothered to check the 4090's die size before posting BS
A 600mm sq monolithic die also has wayyy worse yields than the small chiplets Additionally RDNA3 will be on n5 and n6 which are cheaper than Lovelaces n4 so really there's many reasons why AMD should be cheaper
IIRC current rumors have NAVI31 at TBP of 350 watts That's the big boy total power draw its more comparable to the 320 watts quoted for the 4080 16GB than the 4090 x200B 4090 stock is pulling 22 more power at 450 watts and thats not even AIB's with overclock Factory overclocked 4090's are going to be 500 watts
I'd also rather not upgrade my capacity for sweating
OTOH a little further down the thread During my time at Zotac PC Partner from 2007 2014 we always considered Sapphire as a sister company despite not being a wholely owned brand like Inno3D and Manli While Sapphire was never a wholly owned subsidiary of PC Partner there was some investment Hell the first 5 years or so of Zotac sales decks references Sapphire to establish quality However not all Zotac cards were made by PC Partner either High end Nvidia cards would be made by Flextronics and shipped to AIBs to slap their coolers on bin for overclocking
Gpu z reads my rx480 as Subvendor Sapphire PCPartner why would that be
I'd personally prefer that they charge a fair price that can fund their future hardware and software development and reliable and quality components Both AMD and their partners should be able to make good profit on it I don't expect they should take a loss just so they can increase adoption
nvidia wouldn't sell that to AMD even if AMD paid them double the price
FSR is a lot better than that at least I think it's fair to call them a legit competitor to current DLSS these days
FSR is not DLSS 1 0 quality DLSS 1 0 literally didn't do anything that a standard upscaling technique couldn't do better It was completely worthless Even FSR 1 0 limited as it was was still better than DLSS 1 0
I m praying the 7900 xt is 1k
I wish they wouldn't because I absolute hate DLSS and FSR We had 20 years of more resolution more sharpness less blur the better With these techs we've been saying fuck playing at higher res lets fake it and just get a worse IQ I think IQ is way way down just far less bad than old upscaling methods in some ways worse in others If the Nvidia chips had no tensor cores and just actual shaders then 4k wouldn't be as fast as DLSS 4k but it would be a fair bit faster than 4k native on the current cards Nvidia pushed these reducing IQ modes to compensate for adding RT cores WAY too early
DLSS and similar technologies work best when you feed it better data That requires better rasterization performance That's true for the upscaling 4k 8k is massively better in DLSS then 720p 1440p It simply has more data to go on starting at 4k It's also true for interpolating new frames If you can run it at 120FPS normally you only need to guess at 1 120th of a second of change If you're only running it at 30FPS that's 1 30th a second of change to generate or 4x more data That will cause a drop in quality in those AI generated frames
To be fair they tried that back when they had the performance crown and people still bought Nividia They just need to keep doing what they have been doing Their software in many respects is better than Nvidia now Can't stand Geforce Experience that forces you to sign in and loads of other controls are stuck in Nvidia Control Panel from 15 years ago AMD are making good strides They pushed Nvidia with the last round of cards and hopefully they can push even further this time I don't think they should just try and undercut Nvidia for the sake of it though They need to keep some profits to reinvest and rebuild Though I do think their strategy of multi chip will help with profitability anyway just like it did with Ryzen
Tell that to EVGA
I don't think AMD will charge as much but I'm almost 100 sure that RDNA3 price still will be higher than RDNA2 Also we don t know yet what changes except more performance per watt AMD made there are chances that RDNA3 will be more competitive in advanced features like RT and Super Sampling Their raw performance already is very good
Let's also not discount how massive a deal EVGA dipping from making Nvidia cards will be too That is bound to make a splash
EVGA peacing out of their AIB partnership also gives AMD a HUGE chance to pounce
I feel like zen 2 had the best product for a lot of use cases The 3600 was my budget king the 3300x was the ridiculous budget value on paper even though it was pretty much non existent to buy and the Ryzen 9's were beasts for productivity Even the 3400g had a pretty strong use case at the time as probably the best integrated graphics available The i7's were better for high end gaming but I really don't think 10th gen from Intel was very strong through the full stack The fact that Zen3 was a solid jump and 11th gen totally wet the bed just made the 5000 series even more obvious but they also realized prices across the board and withheld the better bang for the buck CPUs the 5600 and 5700x until the last possible moment
it and paid like 80 FTFY Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didn't help you it is only correct in Nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant The deck is yet to be payed Payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them The rope is payed out You can pull now Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment Beep boop I'm a bot
Nvidia has all these dumb youtubers peddling their free review cards Don't those same YouTubers also get review samples from AMD So doesn't this go both ways Raytracing actually cripples the framerate of nvidia cards but hey Raytracing is better bro If someone likes raytracing they should get the GPU with better raytracing performance regardless of brand
FSR You can test it with you're current gpu AMD doesn't lock it down to specific gpus And yes they have ray tracing although it's a bit behind Nvidea Honestly most of the Nvidea exclusive stuff isn't that important Sure it does improve things but I've never felt I'm missing a ton
damn talking about nVidia domination people do blindly shop and buy nVidia cards Yes nVidia is the only one that has ray tracing and dlss AMD has nothing to compete at all Now take out your wallet and pay up You guys deserve this whole
AMD does have ray tracing but from what I've seen on the most current cards it's at 20 series level for performance They do have FSR as well as the answer to DLSS but that's also able to be used on an Nvidia card AMD have a bunch of things that are a bit more pro consumer by allowing their tech to be used on any card I suppose when you aren't the leader you have to try and keep up otherwise devs wouldn't bother implementing it So basically buying an Nvidia card winds up getting you pretty much all of AMDs offerings while also getting the proprietary Nvidia stuff so it becomes the obvious choice for a lot of people All that said I feel like if AMD ever manages to become the popular choice they'll also start implementing a bunch of proprietary stuff as well They are still a huge corporation at the end of the day
So if I'm a gamer and I'm not ever going to use any of those features tell me how I'm not a fool for buying an AMD card I don't love Nvidia and I have nothing against AMD my entire point is how emotional people are getting about which brand to go with I'm saying that even for someone who won't use those features it's still not a smart purchase to buy an AMD GPU unless they are 100 certain that they will be using the card all the way to end of life where resale value isn't even part of the equation The problem is that even if you're going to buy it and use it for a year or two and then upgrade again Nvidia is going to have significantly more resale value If AMD won't undercut on the raw GPU performance to price ratio why would anyone with a functioning brain buy AMD unless they genuinely have a niche application where AMD is better I know that there are certain aspects of Linux usage that qualify for that but anyone being honest also knows that that's a tiny fraction of everyone that uses computers in the entire world Keep in mind this is entirely predicated on AMD NOT undercutting to a significant degree If it's like 100 cheaper on a 900 card that's not enough for me personally At 20 I'd start recommending it If Nvidia can drop prices to match and it doesn't become a legal case where it is considered anti competitive that's really just AMD not being an actual competitor in the GPU space If some of us feel the need to financially reward them for that by all means Selfishly I would like more people to buy AMD but for 99 of people buying GPUs it is completely emotional to go with AMD unless it's at least 20 cheaper or greater
Jacket Man knows the GPU demand is going to dip now that GPU mining is pretty much dead and has made the gamble that people will still pay top money for new cards It's a very precarious position and a perfect opportunity for AMD to swoop in and undercut the RTX40 as long as ray tracing performance is on par A lot of NVIDIA users feel betrayed by Jacket Man the RTX20 was insultingly expensive this was followed up by the less expensive RTX30 series and Jacket Man telling 1080Ti owners they could now finally upgrade only for miners and scalpers to skyrocket the prices into oblivion Now that GPU mining is dead and GPUs are able to be finally available at normal prices again Jacket Man tries to compensate for its short term business decisions by squeezing the fanbase even more AMD only needs to show up with a normally priced GPU with decent ray tracing performance and it'll sell like hot cakes
The 290X was much louder and hotter that's why It wasn't even close
I didn't As for why people bought it Its because AIB 290X cards weren't available for over a month after the reference card released In fact if memory serves me right they ended up being late about 3 months With the refence model coming out October 2013 and the AIB's aiming for November which then spilled over into 2014 for what were February launches or something like that It was a big shitshow
At the time the 290x matched the Titan in performance but was cheaper AIB coolers were much better than stock too
Entire 2xx 3xx gens were not that great The 300 generation had Fury X which lost to the 980 Ti Fair R9 Fury non X which won vs the 980 AIBs for the same cost but was more than the lowest end 980s R9 Nano which was niche R9 390X which flanked the 980 and often defeated it or came close R9 390 which defeated the 970 R9 380X which crushed the 960 4GB R9 380 which also crushed the 960s R7 370 which I admit lost to the GTX 950 R7 360 which was meh next to the 750 Ti x200B Now this is a STRONG generation Add discounted R9 290s and 290Xes and Id say it is one of AMD's strongest generations from the POV of the consumer in recent history
They actually were great the reference coolers were terrible though and thermal throttled the cards
Yep the RX480 was one of the best price performance GPUs ever It was amazing That's what AMD needs a 299 GPU with RX6700XT performance would sweep the marketplace Of course they need to compete at the high end too but halo products are more about mindshare than marketshare
The future of gaming cards running native 720p in 30 FPS with 256x256 textures and guesstimating the Matrix because approximations interpolations heuristics shorthands hacks and cheats accounting for individual eye movement and perceptual blind spots are less computationally intensive than honest 4k rendering Input lag What input lag We prerender your decisions before your brain makes them In five seconds you're going to buy a battle pass
Some of y'all are sad Already trying to trash on DLSS3 before we can even analyze it properly Y'all did the same thing with DLSS before trying to downplay it or make it sound like it's terrible and that nobody actually likes it Embarrassing platform warrior stuff
On the subject of Linux it's worth remembering that if you want Ray Tracing you are using the proprietary driver just like Nvidia users
If AMD was actually pricing their products as an underdog I could understand your point The problem with Radeon GPUs is that AMD tries to price themselves similarly Look at the launch prices for the Radeon VII 5000 and 6000 series They didn't undercut Nvidia by any notable margin the 6800 XT was priced similarly to the 3080 and the 6800 was slightly higher than the 3070 If they really wanted to undercut they would have launched the 6800 XT at 3070 prices The last time AMD did something like that was with the HD 4870 in 2008 AMD is always playing catch up with Nvidia Even now that they're likely to become number 1 in traditional forward rendering it's almost moot due the industry shift to ray tracing Sure you'll be able to push 1000 fps in CS GO but what about Cyberpunk 2077 Nvidia does this too but they have the advantage of being the undisputed leader as well as pushing new and exciting technology It took AMD nearly 3 years to almost match DLSS 2 and now DLSS 3 looks to be a solid improvement Similarly with G sync and NVENC while RTX Broadcast and Omniverse has no match
AMD had problems with frame pacing It was a thing You can't deny that
You dont just linearly 'add' stuff like this lol Performance just doesn't work like that in reality
2x clocks Wut
minimum 6x better lol
Resizeable BAR wasn't an AMD feature its been part of the PCIe spec for years It's why a Intel and Nvidia both have it too
even just forcing nvidia to put out reasonable prices is a win in my book
Nvidia isn't looking untouchable right now 4xxx reveal wasn't very impressive They lost EVGA as a partner which was an AiB favorite for many consumers given their card quality and customer service Lots of bad press regarding Nvidia and how they deal with other companies AMD has an opportunity to steal a lot of market and mindshare here with many past Nvidia buyers willing to change teams if AMD can just be decent It feels like that's the bar right now
20series wasn't a great series a far cry from it
Yeah I will probably go AMD next if the price is right I have never spent more than 500 on a GPU and don't plan on doing that now
That is just misleading news from Tech power up using N 's current price It is not AMD announcing new MSRPs
I m praying to god that the 7900 xt is a flat 1k
Pretty much what you said I'm sure that's all great information for the right person but I just don't want light bleed anymore haha
They did in the past and Nvidia massively outsold them anyway Several years ago Lisa Su said that AMD was no longer going to be the budget option and they followed through on that Here we are today with Nvidia pricing at whatever the hell they feel like and everyone bitching at AMD for not significantly undercutting them I don't blame AMD at all
tf are feature set I've never used any features Just marketing bs
Worse overall experience How so
I don't remember any time AMD released a driver that slowed me down in seven years of using AMD graphics so I'm not sure what the purpose of this question is
Whatever the last driver my 8800 GTS 320MB used I guess It's been so long ago that I don't remember if I had issues or not The worst issue I had with AMD was the infamous black screen crash a few years ago and it wasn't even that bad for me as I could go back to 19 12 1 and not have any crashes at all All of my other Radeon cards I haven't really had any issues I think there was a locking issue with hardware accelerated YouTube in full screen way back when on my HD 4870 but again it wasn't much of an issue since I could find no difference between hardware and software flash video or whatever YouTube was using at the time Every other card has been solid and the drivers never really gave me any trouble I remember people complaining about AMD drivers back during my 4870 6870 7970 owning years but I also remember thinking how my gaming experience was solid by comparison I guess I got lucky
I'm too tired to go really looking but the 9700 Pro HD 5970 HD 7970 and R9 290X were all apparently faster than their GeForce equivalents and sold nowhere near as much apparently the 9700 Pro was in some cases twice as fast as the competing GeForce 4 TI 4600 The blower style cooler is probably responsible for a lot of it in the later cards since it made them run hot and loud the 290X was notorious for this but AIB custom cards came with decent cooling and they still didn't sell anywhere near what could be considered close to Nvidia
Sure but the law requiring a company to serve shareholder's best interest does not restrict a company to quarterly results
Except the only way to escape chasing quarterly profits is to go private And in the US that typically involves private equity buying companies and turning them private so the financial devouring is done behind closed doors and isn't obvious when they offer the remaining heavily indebted husk for sale as if it had turned around Any sane investor should be willing to hold AMD and let Dr Su and her leadership team do their thing But there aren't enough sane investors
Back then the situation was not as severe
steam hardware survey includes communal PCs in gaming cafes being logged into from multiple users
I dumb is unnecessary Not everyone can keep up on tech news it just means though that it's bad for competition cause nvidia has guaranteed buyers
I'm waiting until the Rx 7900 and Rx 7800 If the Rx 7800 is just slower than the 4080 At 799 that probably will be my 1099 If neither I will be going for a used GPU depending on price to performance I will no longer be ripped off
I just bought a 6800xt over a 3080 Primarily because of EVGA backing out that's only who I would buy GPUs from Had an RX580 for a short while and thought it was great Because of that I knew AMD was certainly not as bad as most people think So far I'm quite happy with the 6800xt Not a gigantic leap from my 1080ti however I'm very cpu limited for a couple more days until I upgrade the Ryzen 5 2600 to a 5800x3d Should be a nice little bump
If DLSS3 really does what Nvidia says it does it would be amazing But there are all sorts of potential snags with potential input lag and compatibility Possibly with static elements like UI too We'll need to see what digital foundry GN and the rest of the cognoscenti say about it
Based on just my anecdotes I see more AMD specific issues with games
I haven't installed GeForce Experience in years and I download the drivers without an issue
No you don't can always just download directly from
you are fake news you don't need any account to download the driver and Nvidia Experience is facultative not mandatory
You actually need a geforce experience account to get the latest Nvidia drivers
I have to agree with this Completely Perhaps in some cases the nvidia drivers are better than AMD's but definitely not for Linux Broken Wayland support mediocre power management frequent crashes and breakage every time the kernel version changes This by itself has basically guaranteed that I'm going AMD for GPUs Period
Dude I have a 5700xt the only way to fix the crashes from the drivers is by using Amernime modded drivers I have never had a crash with Nvidia's GPUs and I had two gpus before this one I swore to never buy a product from AMD again after crashing at least twice a day and them still not fixing it Nvidia's drivers are much more stable
If AMD's caught up in drivers it's only after a long time of being behind Yeah most of the time and on the biggest titles it ran fine But it would have issues in many games that nvidia simply didn't have and they would take a long time to fix Hell when they cut off HD7000 and older cards from upgrading they cut them off from the driver fixes except for the few where you could get one final beta driver that fixed a couple of the problems that resulted in straight up guaranteed crashes I think AMD has a tendency to bring good value but it's never been without caveat and I always have a better experience with nvidia GPUs
I have played a few games with RT fine with a 2080ti which is like a 3070
Sure is especially when combined with dlss to offset the fps hit
I read awhile back people were complaining about NVIDIA s Control Panel looking way too dated and that it needs a UI update As I read through the replies I agreed with them though Control Panel may be dated but it just works Always I ve never had a single problem with NVIDIA Control Panel
When did I defend Nvidia Their prices were even more fucked than AMD I was pointing out that AMD's lower msrp had no effect if both AMD Nvidia were overpriced RTX 3070 prices
EVGA GeForce RTX 3070 XC3 Ultra Gaming 08G P5 3755 KL 8GB GDDR6 iCX3 Cooling ARGB LED Metal Backplate LHR
but it turns out it's not so great We haven't even had any chance to analyze it yet properly What are you talking about
I'm so confused DLSS 2 2 is basically black magic with with 4k actually achievable at high fps at near max graphics with compatible cards So are you saying DLSS 3 0 is actually worse
why the interposed frame seem to be a good idea we have to wait indipendent reviews also to check LAG and QUALITY
This is true I'm wary of AMD for CPUs after what they did to us on X370 had they not been so greedy right up until Alder Lake start eating their sales I'd have a 5950X instead of buying Alder Lake Z but AMD lost all their goodwill on CPUs GPUs though AMD is the best and only choice at least until Intel can actually compete nVidia have always been hostile to my needs and show no signs of changing and are getting worse as a company
Hey OP Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3 Please read the rules or message the mods for any further clarification
I personally saw them sell for over 1400 though
Honestly the Steam Deck is a godsend for budget and portable gaming The only trick next would be to have DLSS or similar to make sure future AAA games hold out until the Steam Deck 2 Given how long the Index has been out I reckon the Steam Deck won't get a revision for at least 2 more years
In that case it'd be fsr 3 0 that saves us nvidia 3000 users then right Nvidia said they will still support dlss 2 0
You don t do that in game setting Or msi afterburner to oc
Dude DLSS3 looks to be like a interpolation method It grabs frames out of thin air You have more frames but also a higher latency which defeats the purpose of higher frames The 2 4x claim is just pure marketing Dependant on how much generations you witnessed at launch you should know better Compare NVs claims of DLSS1 for 20series in their presentation and real life Performance
AMD needs RDNA3 to be a total win at this point The fact of the matter is many different sectors that involve the use of GPUs outside of gaming are now shifting their horizons towards using AI as it ultimately makes everyone's job easier and will also be the future of game development AMD is light years behind when compared to Nvidia when it comes to consumer grade AI technology and that's a recipe for disaster in these evolving sectors Simply being good at rasterization but at the cost of added driver issues and poor support for older graphics APIs as well as lackluster performance in a vast majority of creation and modeling software to the point where they're not even worth mentioning in that sector is not going to cut it I love AMD and used them for a very long time but they've really got to get their shit together before I consider moving back over to them call me crazy but I think them trying to innovate too much in quite frankly the wrong areas is hurting them more than it's helping
192 bit bus is for 60 class 900 for a 60 class
No executives want as high as possible profit Launching products that don't compete with your older products will give little reason for a customer of your old product to buy a new one Better to sell 3 gpus at 30 markup than 1 at 100 markup This of course isn't true in a shortage
Their gpus are going into workstations as much as gaming rigs Anyways Nvidia saw what we were willing pay for gpus and how eBay and scalpers made hundreds of millions off their gpus
It CAN happen though when the right thing and the smart move for the company marketshare coincide We saw them do it with R 's smart enough people there to realize the similarities unfolding in the GPU
I m with you I doubt that they re going to do anything that s actually pro consumer but I am hopefully they don t do something extremely anti consumer
Nvidia was making profit off the backs of crypto the last few years They have lost that segment entirely
That's exactly what Executives think The market will bear what it will bear It really calls BS on the idea that companies will regulate themselves or will do what makes sense for the long term survival of a industry We are about to get a test of this because we have at least 3 competitors right now That's pretty exciting Nvidia doesn't make most of their money in the consumer FPU space anymore For God's sake they are charging 900 for a 70 class GPU It would be really great if AMD would do the right thing but I'm not going to count on it They are doing the right thing though That is maximizing profit for their shareholders I'm not saying I support that but that is our economic system and how we have turned into Neo liberal capitalism
in 2022 GPUs really exist to accelerate compute clusters the fact that they're also pretty good for gaming is merely a nice side effect if gaming was actually important in the grand scheme of things they would've fought harder against AMD for consoles
Come to think of it production WAS ramped up because of the mining plague Now that Ethereum is finally dead and worthless get Monero bros it's not like AMD can suddenly wind down that production overnight makes me think that capability can be shifted to make as many cheap GPUs as possible and the gaming base's needs aren't as crazy as miners People ran massive server farms with many GPUs tied together The average gamer only needs one card so it should be possible to meet demand
I'll probably stick to consoles as I am feeling the strain of just wanting to plop down on the couch and be gaming right away these days
if they can somehow price a card at the level of that 4070 for 600 instead of nvidia's asking of 900 i think a lot of people are going to jump on board
Well my next card will be Ryzen I bought a 3080 but only because it was EVGA
If amd made the 7900 xt 1k flat would you buy
In general they're just jacking up prices as aggressively as possible with no justification From the Surface Pro 7 to the 8 the cost of entry went from 750 to 1 100 This is because they dropped the lowest price model the 750 i3 model with 4 GB of RAM and raised the i5 8G model from 900 to 1 200 They added a wireless charger to their keyboards and deemed that reason to remove it from the Slim Pen's box Now the price of the pen has dropped from about 145 to 130 However if you want to actually charge the thing you need to get a 35 charger a 65 Pen Dover for your 1 500 phone or a 180 keyboard for your 1 100 tablet Up through the Surface Pro 4 you got a pen free in the box by the way They stopped that with the fifth generation which they called the New Surface Pro a time at which they ALSO raised the price of the Surface In fact they took the pen out of the purchase raised the price of the tablet AND raised the price of the standalone pen purchase from 50 to 100 and now the Slim Pen's even more I have a Surface Duo 2 by the way I was hesitant on buying it but got a good deal through Best Buy They sold it with 2 year old parts for 1 400 the first time around Then they upgraded it to things like having a camera and using a 6 month old chip and raised the starting price to 1 500 They also removed the charger from the box AND stopped including the semi protective bumper with it So they took about 50 75 of accessories away and raised the price 100
calm down there If put into a position of potential stomping nvidia could easily slash prices Lots of folks don't buy AMD for a number of reasons as well I'm not an nvidia fan boy but I've only owned nvidia cards going back to like 1997 and they haven't let me down I hope FSR takes off on consoles and forces some convergence in upscaling technologies similar to adaptive sync but in the interim AMD is going to need a healthy performance margin at a lower price to sway many consumers
It's not arguing semantics your entire argument is about what the card is called It is not and has never been the 4070 The make were as they always are bullshit and you are crying that Nvidia's announcement contradicted them
There is no such card as the 4070 as of right now
And the current xx80 has the same reference number as 2013's xx60 Guess that means it's 200 because clearly none of these things are arbitrary
Fanboys have higher tolerance for bullshit but they are not immune What AMD lacks is continued success RDNA2 is the first time in a LONG time since Hawaii really that AMD shows that it can hang with the halo product from nVidia Also IIRC Sothern Islands was mildly underwhelming against Kepler at launch it wasn't until much later that HD7970 pulled ahead of GTX680 4870 aside AMD showed that they could take marketshare in a not too distant past with Polaris so it can be done if they play their cards right
The cuda framework allows for gpgpu compute AMD has ROCm but if you google cuda vs rocm you'll see how limited the support is Which is sad because I wanna get into ML work but I'm never buying a NVIDIA card lol
Cuda is important for ai ml as most frameworks don t support amd gpus well
Shh it's normal for a x80 tier card to offer 25 less performance and have a different gpu die nomenclature than an x80 card s Oh and to just not have a x70 card
900 4060 Ti in disguise FTFY
thanks for correction I was looking at the new datacenter something or other
The reference 5700XT was I think made by XFX Unfortunately that card had a habit of overheating Worth noting however that the non reference cards by XFX were fine
And yet that's presumably because none of us have the materials cost sheet in front of us exactly what they did with ryzen until the 5000 series where they had a world beater for 6 8 months It worked
Nvidia bought wafers for a more advanced node aswell so it would not be a easy swap
Perhaps FSR 2 1 but so far any game with FSR or FSR 2 i've tried i've turned it off after a few minutes It looks way worse than native in 1440p ultra quality FSR I don't know about DLSS since i don't own an Nvidia GPU but for me so far it's not worth running
Given that Turing literally performed identically to Pascal I don't doubt for a minute that Ampere was double the performance of Turing and as for the 4090 DigitalFoundry have already benchmarked it in Cyberpunk It's an interesting watch
4090's raw raster no raytracing or DLSS is supposed to be like 50 75 faster than the 3090 Ti or around 80 faster than the 3090 Not quite 2x but close After over a decade of 10 30 generational performance gains an 80 raw performance gain with a 2x 4x gain is pretty nice to see
FSR is fundamentally different vs DLSS and the reason why both exist in the first place is to maintain image quality while boosting performance as much as possible DLSS does a better 's a LOT better DLSS 3 raised the bar quite a bit I don't think FSR can improve enough to compete with DLSS 3 without some MASSIVE changes It's great that AMD is able to do THAT much with a less complex solution though
Maybe more like 1100 The new Radeons are supposed to be around 25 more power efficient and do better on raster but still fall short on raytracing video encoding and lack analogs for some of nvidia's other software tools I've heard rumors that the HIGHEST end Radeon 7000 GPU is going to be closer to 2300 too
The IQ will improve but DLSS 2 on the upper quality settings is actually really REALLY good Advanced upscaling and frame interpolation are necessary technologies moving forward Chip density has a hard limit and leading edge fabrication is getting EXTREMELY expensive Chiplets and 3D stacking can only do so much on the hardware side of things
EVGA was an AIB partner
As an AIB partner margins are slim but the company selling the chip to the partner has a gigantic profit margin Some estimate Nvidia's at 60
Given the pricing trend I wouldn't be mad about a 100 increase of rdna2 msrp but not more
DLSS and Raytracing is why i prefer Nvidia and DLSS 3 0 and Raytracing overdrive just looks too damn good for me to getting an AMD GPU over a 4090 I do prefer AMD CPUS tho for now No brand loyalty to anyone i just buy whatever is best for my use
The problem is FSR and RT performance is MUCH weaker on AMD's side It's about double or triple performance difference in higher resolution Not even a competition and that's the problem AMD fixes that or at least closes the gap a lot of consumers will finally consider buying AMD cards instead of Nvidia's monopolistic cards
So basically buying an Nvidia card winds up getting you pretty much all of AMDs offerings while also getting the proprietary Nvidia stuff so it becomes the obvious choice for a lot of people No retort Just highlighting the stupidity of the average modern consumer rewarding anti consumer practices

Nvidia is going to have significantly more resale value Is it did you consider the original purchase price is much higher And what if it broke after warranty because of heat Also have you considered higher power consumption cost it is completely emotional to go with AMD unless it's at least 20 cheaper or greater For me it is the other way around People buying 2nd hand video cards does not care about AL ML performance
I guess the difference is that AMD is forever remembered as loud and hot when Nvidia have had just as bad well worse really generations in the past and that was all forgotten as soon as they released good stuff again
I bought the 295x2 or what it was called with liquid cooling What a beast for its age see no evil monkeyOK hand
I have six case fans in an all AMD system with a stock CPU cooler and a 6800xt and it's the quietest gaming computer I have ever owned
It wasn't that louder as in decibels but pitch was very different While the fan on the Titan cooler went hum Hawaii's screeched
It matched the original Kepler Titan Then the GTX 900 series and the Pascal Titan came out not long after and completely dunked on what AMD had And AMD never had a real answer to the 900 series It took until the GTX 1000 series for AMD to have a proper answer and that was just the 480 vs 1060 6GB Then AMD didn't have a proper answer to anything again until the 5700XT matched the 1080 Ti but had less VRAM and came out much later AMD were simply dropping the ball constantly until the RX6000 series
It also used a lot more power to reach the Titan level speed I stuck with 7770 then jumped to 750 Ti back then because 200 series just ran too damn hot
People forgot about the just buy a 390 comments from back then 2 390 280X aka 7970Ghz and 480 are probably the best value GPUs AMD ever released
Would you honestly call Fury Nano part of the 3xx series though They were in a class of their own Reminds me of Radeon VII Anyway They were strong in terms of raw speed but again they were not at all efficient compared to their GeForce equivalent Every single one consumed more energy and needed better coolers which not all of the cards got It all came off as an attempt to hold the fort until Polaris arrived to me Of course my argument absolutely falls apart if you don't care about efficiency
You're forgetting one important factor in most of these comparisons the AMD card came out 6 months after the Nvidia one The 980 came out September 2014 and the R9 390x came out in June 2015 The 390x came out it was still 5 slower than the 980 and that's 9 months after the 980 had released
I have a 3080 I play Cyberpunk DLSS 3 0 is not going to help there Why It adds input latency simple as that To interpolate frames you need a future frame so the GPU has to delay enough to generate your current frame and one in the future this adds quite a bit of latency if you play at 60 fps for example we are talking about 17ms here But now you have the future frame and you can interpolate a ton of frames in between awesome I do like the idea if the interpolation works well you'd get a much smoother image pretty cool thing BUT your inputs are still at your original framerate So you might play at 50 fps in Cyberpunk with RT on but frame interpolation can display 100 fps on your screen It will look smooth to someone watching you play but as you play and move the mouse around you'll feel the 50 fps with fps drops gameplay not a smooth real 100 fps That's my main issue with DLSS 3 the idea is cool but if you actually want smooth gameplay input lag and 1 lows matter a ton I currently play at 1440p 240hz and Cyberpunk feels like absolute crap at 60 fps when my GPU is at 100 usage giving me 30ms latency I had to fiddle with the settings quite a bit to get render latency down otherwise I nearly puked when moving the camera Now I still have 60 fps but at 17ms latency and it's playable still not great Without RT I get 90 fps that's nice but the lighting is cool
The minimum buy in for DLSS 3 is 900 What else do you need to analyze
The problem is that no matter what you do If your total perceived frames do not come from the game engine you will always add latency even thou you get perceived smoothness We can only fight it that much So in a sense parent comment is right We only care about fps
It was amusing watching this sub gradually transition from we don't need want upscaling to FRS 1 is almost as good as DLSS to FRS 1 was bad but FRS 2 is almost as good as DLSS I expect FRS 3 with frame interpolation to also be a game changer whenever it comes out
I find it funny how some folks love DLSS despite it making visual quallity oftentimes simply worse Oh and making DLSS basically mandatory if you want to use Ray Traycing that's also a good joke No matter the DLSS and Ray traycing these new 4 slot bricks of powerhungry GPUs Nvidia bestows upon us are trully something horrendous Same as their pricing
Analyzing what It's just a thing akin to soap opera TV effect or SVP aka Smooth Video Project but for games It won't magically allow you to get finer control over what happens in the game it literally hallucinates frames in between real frames rendered by the GPU you don't have any control of what happens in between them So if you play at 20 fps you won't feel that you play at 60 fps with DLLS3 enabled It will still feel as laggy as it was before and I'm talking about the same resolution not with upscaling enabled In any case I'm against all forms of TAA regardless of whose label is on it I'd rather dial down the settings than suffer ghosting and the other visual artefacts
Y'all did the same thing with DLSS before trying to downplay it or make it sound like it's terrible and that nobody actually likes it DLSS 1 was maligned for a reason Even though I defended it P
The problem with Radeon GPUs is that AMD tries to price themselves similarly From AMD's standpoint there is no problem as long as they are selling all the chips they can
given that the bottleneck for raytracing is exactly those units it should be pretty close to linear
Yeah and neither Intel nor NVIDIA cared to take advantage of it until AMD did so and showed free performance gains with little effort I didn't say AMD invented it
So basically you want to buy an nvidia card for a lower price not buy a good AMD card That kinda proves his point
I agree
Let's look at what AMD sent out to compete with the unpopular RTX 2000 series A 5500XT that performed the same as an RX580 for the same price as an RX580 A 5600XT that was actually a pretty solid value A 5700 5700XT that was literally broken for about a year Nothing in the AMD stack could beat the already aging 1080Ti and those who did choose RDNA1 over RTX 2000 missed out on raytracing and will eventually miss out on DX12U
It honestly wasn't bad but it was stupid expensive for what it was with raytracing feature when it didn't matter Comparably reasonable 30xx pricing at least at MSRP made people forget They made the non raytracing versions of their cards 16xx series for a reason
Which AMD product was better than a 2080TI or a 2080 Super
Between the fiddley drivers meh encoders when they even had encoders worse feature set and poor regional pricing Vega GPUs were eternally full price in Canada right up until the last ones slowly slid off shelves how is this surprising I will buy the best AMD has to offer if they put a competitive price on it IN CANADA and that's a promise But if they do the classic Nvidia 50 I can't guarantee anything
The last time AMD undercut Nvidia by more then 100 was the 290x against the GTX 780ti and they failed to sell because of noise and heat issues This time they could undercut them and have the better efficiency
Sound of 290X fan terribad HD 4 5k AF quality etc
I would argue maximizing profit is serving the best interest of the shareholders This isn't some meta Facebook where you want to corner the market There isn't loyalty in the graph card business
the situation now for amd isnt really that different its arguably worse in fact the only choices for a majority of buyers is either shell out big cash for the rtx4000 or just buy the cheaper rtx3000 cards with the excess inventory of rtx3000 from nvidia and AIB's its not far fetch to say a further discount to clear out inventory will be implemented soon enough before or after rdna3 launches the end stays the same AMD wont make a dent on NV's 80 market share hell even ex mining used rtx3000 cards are also flooding the market with freefalling prices like 300 400 for an rtx3080 for example and will only get cheaper as these miners very nice people undercut one another for selling us their junk pre owned gpu TLDR rdna3 will be battling cheap rtx3000 surplus and rtx4000 fanboy wetdream at the same time amd is stuck between a rock and a hard place
i know but that doesn't change the fact that entry to mid range are the vast majority of buyers even during the pandemic lockdown up till now these same cards are dominating the steam hardware survey despite cafes being out of business
I am going to agree with you on not calling them dumb But they really should just go on a forum and ask E g we have seen so many people not old tech illiterate ones lose money to scammers online when they could have asked on an expert forum
This sounds like the Turing mood all over again People grumble now but buy the thing anyway after some time
You'll notice the leap when you install the x3d
Dude I did the same upgrade 5800X3D and if you don't see at least double the performance something is rly wrong with your rig
Not sure about x3d but with heavily OC'd 5900x 4 8 ghz fixed many games are CPU limited in 1080p I have 270 hz monitor even at the highest settings SoTTR Forza Horizon Elex II Doom Eternal and some others I've played after I bought 6900xt
You could have gotten an evga 3000 series though so that reasoning doesn t make much sense i could see if you were skipping the 3000 series and going to rx7000 but you literally could get evga 3k cards
I have a 1440p 240hz display so DLSS 3 sounds amazing at first Till you realize You are adding 1ms of latency just to activate the feature and then a full frame latency because you need a future frame to interpolate And even if the thing produces 500 fps if your game engine runs at 50 fps it will feel like crap to play Sure someone watching you play will get a super smooth image but as you move the mouse you can tell that's not high fps gaming
As I explained to someone else those most likely aren't the latest game ready drivers I am guessing those are the ones they supply on Windows update that are always somewhat behind
I actually could not install nvidias drivers manually it always threw unsupported OS at me on a fresh install For some reason though I could install the same Driver with Geforce Experience effectively forcing me to use GFE for no good reason Complete pain in the rear not a good experience And no I did not download the wrong driver
Yes and are those actually the latest drivers Nvidia releases drivers to Windows update every so often but they aren't the newest
I have never had a GPU related crash with AMD I have had many with Nvidia in both Windows and Linux I have also had things like vsync refuse to work with Nvidia drivers on Linux
I ve got a Gigabyte 5700xt Was plagued by that too but turned out to be concurrent with windows updates Once I turned off auto updates it stayed stable Windows was really the culprit in my case
Back in days you used an unofficial Omega drivers to actually make the Radeon
Lol apart from the early release which I waited out only upgraded after that I am on that card until now and it's just fine driver wise You must have other problems specific to your case because most owners are saying the same
Then you clearly haven't used Linux very much Nvidia drivers for Linux have probably gotten better but in the past they were awful AMD have had decent Linux support for a long time Also let's not ignore games using Nvidia proprietary technology and testing more on Nvidia cards
I never understood the crying about the UI looking dated I'll take function over form any day of the week with system components everything is easy to go find and as you said it just works
Not the same guy but just based on how it works it will have issues Say you are getting 50 fps in your game like Cyberpunk DLSS 3 can swoop in and interpolate you 100 fps out of it for example Sounds awesome right But to interpolate something you need to wait for a future frame so you add latency you need to wait for one more frame to generate at 50 fps that would be 20ms So you are basically playing at sub 50 fps when it comes to input Moving your mouse etc The output will look smooth but as you play the game it's likely that it won't feel smooth At least in heavy titles If you interpolate from 120 fps to 240 fps I currently play on a 1440p 240hz display then it might be pretty cool but the added delay would still feel worse than just playing at 120 probably
It's a weird idea we need reviews and benchmarks to see how good it truly is It sounds great for content creation getting smooth captures of very heavy games but a game looking smooth doesn't matter to players if it doesn't feel equally smooth Nvidia Reflex will have to prove itself here
AMD had to put in a lot of work to make Zen 3 work properly on X370 that was their first real attempt at a proper new platform since the Bulldozer maybe one more if DDR6 slips
Where I m gonna need to see proof or else it s just he said she said
Dont bother with John He is a known Intel and Nvidia marketing troll
Nope I tried using it with a RTX 2060 and loved the ease of undervolting with the AMD driver more grinning face with sweat
Uh I remember when mid range was 200 Like the 560 What are you supposed to buy for some casual gaming nowadays
The Halo Effect is real The average consumer thinks the maker of the fastest card overall means the lower end cards are also best in class This is why almost every time in the past couple of years that it was rumored that AMD had a card or cards that overall would take the crown Nvidia would announce a Titan or Super cards to keep it Probably is why they also planned on 600 and 800W TDPs with the 4000 series just in case AMD managed to really overdeliver this generation
Over 1000 for a 4070 I refuse to call the 12GB version an 80 class card
I want a card I can tell someone just get the 7600XT bro and not even think twice That's what I was doing when the 3600 came out AMD needs that default go to lower midrange gamer card that's cheap
Does the width of the memory bus really matter that much Better to look at total memory bandwidth since it is a combination of memory clock and bus width If it's high enough to feed all the cores then meh it can be a 64 bit bus for all I care
I get your point but bus width isn't the only factor for things Being on a newer faster memory alleviates a chunk of those issues The effective bandwidth is going to be the decider and it goes beyond that width I hope we eventually get the right products to test the truth If a 4060 or 4070 maybe in a Ti variant can get a wider bus and similar everything else I'd love to see if we can see a significant change in performance with nothing but a wider bus Thay Nvidia didn't call this thing a 4070 though is really stupid It's either going to be made useless when a feature filled 4070 finally launches or they're going to be left neutering the hell out of the 4070 8 10 GB VRAM to make the stack make sense
Does the width of the memory bus really matter that much Better to look at total memory bandwidth since it is a combination of memory clock and bus width If it's high enough to feed all the cores then meh it can be a 64 bit bus for all I care
It used to be that a 256 bit bus was for the 60 class card before Nvidia called GK104 the 680 and charged 500 for it
60 class depends entirely on performance which you are not privvy to
That is a bit strange they did the same thing AMD did with RDNA 2 cut bus width increase cache by a lot

Man that's annoying What bothers me is I'll see the Surfaces on sale for lower with accessories bundled in from retailers like Best Buy So I feel like they're setting the MSRP high and then using sales to make up for it to capture everyone as they staircase down
That depends Nvidia is notoriously stubborn and wants to be seen as the premium brand So they may just keep prices high even when 40 series isn't selling to make people buy their 30 series stock out They want to be the equivalent of Nintendo where they can keep prices high so people will just pay up and not have to worry about anything being devalued
Here's what they're trying to say and if you're still having trouble understanding this then I'm taking you for a troll because it can't be made any simpler than this 4080 12GB was probably made to be the 4070 but then rebranded more like renamed internally as a 4080 it has EVERY characteristics of a xx70 card except the name So you going Umm ackshually they called it a 4080 is literally doing nothing but arguing semantics No one cares what Nvidia is calling it The correct term would be renamed but the point still stands as a whole they are changing the name to make the card more attractive and make the consumers think it is worth the price both bad practises that people are pissed about
It's a complete different die You can't be that blind 4080 12gb vs 16gb model it's a complete different graphics card
I know sometimes the 60 will come late and the 50 might not come at all but when was the last time there was no 70 series card at launch Has that ever happened
I mean at first I thought it was a simple memory reduction like the RX 580 480 570 470 Then i saw the rest of the specs What the hell I have no idea wtf Nvidia is thinking
Hi we had a pandemic that caused a global chip shortage and unpredictable demand and supply which means we have warehouses full of 3000 series that need to be shifted before it makes any sense at all to create 4000 series cards of equivalent performance As soon as the 3090s and 3080s are all sold out there will definitely be a 4070 announced
How can it be exactly what they did and presumably at the same time Either they did or they didn't but as you noted we can't possibly know unless they told us In any case if they did operate at a loss it's only because they could afford to do so because of selling at huge profit to enterprise clients A luxury they don't have with Radeon
As a 2070 super user DLSS can vary a lot Most quality settings in games though are worth the gains in FPS vs not having it on at 2k I prefer high fps but visuals come first and I have enjoyed DLSS
Yeah guess adoption is obviously pretty bad right now since it's so new and a lot of games will never get it but I did mean 2 1
Everyone rides the dick of upscalling but the simple fact is upscalling looks very very noticeably worse than native always has literally always will It's a huge backwards step and we only have it because Nvidia wanted to add RT cores 2 3 generations minimum more like 4 5 before RT was truly viable so they decided improve lighting reduce image IQ everywhere else to compensate and now because the way the industry works everyone is trying to fight PR with PR rather than IQ with crap I won't run FSR because it just looks bad imagine artifacts and some level of blur everywhere fuck that But every single review I see of DLSS and every time I try it on friends computers it's largely the same
Yup Just reinstalled Tarkov and was wondering why it was so blurry than what I recall Problem was AMD FSR 1 0 I'm getting basically the same FPS with it turned off vs FSR 1 0 Quality preset and the image is so much clearer 6800XT 3440x1440p averaging 100ish FPS However FSR 2 0 looks like a big improvement
Turing did not perform the same as Pascal maybe price to performance at certain tiers
About to check out the review but I'm going guess now and edit in a bit I'm going to guess not much faster in most scenarios but put it up to psycho levels on a few RT things and it's 2x as fast like 40fps instead of 20fps but it's say 150fps vs 130fps without RT EDIT lul I see it was 22fps with everything maxed and NO DLSS at 4k and 100fps with DLSS 3 0 Amazing that they didn't say what it got with RT and DLSS 2 0 so they could massively over exaggerate what it got with DLSS 3 0
Dlss3 is just frame interpolation no gamer wants that The illusion of higher FPS without the responsiveness is just pure stupidity I know why Nvidia is doing this but it will backfire spectacularly I hope
I really hope your wrong
I personally don't believe so at all Firstly we still have a long way to go in terms of optimising throughput the way data is stored and the way we code games The difference alone between the most optimised games and the least optimised games shows us how easily some games would very very easily run 2 3x faster That also assumes the best games are at the limit which they aren't As with all things everyone is doing the bare minimum in general so a lot of game engines are made to run as fast as they need to and with usually engine built on old engine built on old engine etc etc We have miles to go on software we have a lot to go on hardware then nodes will become a limit But lets say the hard limit on cost viability is 4x 250mm 2 2nm dies Either that die can have 30 dedicated to interpolating hardware that gives us lets say 8k interpolated at 120fps or 70fps native or we can have no interpolation hardware and get 100fps native and no dlss fsr type shit It will only ever be efficient to a certain percentage of the core and you will always need to have a certain amount of pure rendering performance to make good enough quality to be interpolated But personally I'd always take say 25 faster at native res than 50 faster interpolated But really most important when we hit that limit games will have to stop and limit their graphics and software to those graphics and the hardware available Once everything closes in on a real limit just have that limit give us the right performance on that hardware
No brand loyalty to anyone i just buy whatever is best for my use
I think you are another It is all about how you value things Why the power consumption or more VRAM is not as important These are the hardware that you will never get updated after you bought the card All other features could be improved and they did get improved after a few months from release If you guys value whatever nVidia told you then you guys deserve the prices they ask you to swallow So shut up and pay up
Fermi had so much memeing around how hot it ran at the time too People frying eggs on GTX 480s and fire everywhere Crazy that it was just instantly forgotten
That's true but you can't force people with a fringe interest whose update cycle is every 8 years to pay attention to the changes in the industry The only exception is when they get burned by making a bad choice once they'll try to avoid it next time Like for example upgrading from Intel Ivy Bridge to say Skylake and gaining almost nothing That makes a big change like Ryzen 1 actually blow up We just have to wait for people to get as sick of Nvidia as they were of Intel back then
People still rememer the Thermi memes But 290X or Vega 64 are much recent
What on earth does that have to do with the 290X being noisy
I have half that many fans and a 5800x and 6800xt and agreed I hear the old archived files HDD in there above any other sounds it makes If I had all SSD it would be very quiet in comparison to all my other and previous systems
It was quite a bit louder in uber mode In this review it even says Overall I am disappointed by the acoustic experience the R9 290X provides AMD should have invested some time into developing a good cooler like NVIDIA did with the GTX Titan
And AMD never had a real answer to the 900 series Huh The 390x Fury and Fury X don't count If anything AMD was totally absent for the 1000 series
No it was the same and mostly more for nVidia Hot and power are not equal things with Artic IV Extreme my 290 was always sub 60C and it was very quiet even with 1179 1650 OC
It also used a lot more power to reach the Titan level speed Both the Titan and the 290X used similar amounts of power The 290X had a worse cooler but otherwise the perf watt was similar for both
I've kept a printout of my RX480 preorder on my desk for the past couple of years as a reminder that these prices will someday come back down I paid 200 for a Red Devil 480 8GB and it came with Civ and Doom 2016 Still runs games in 1080 just fine and can bump up a few titles to 1440 Now I'm waiting for a 500 6800XT which still feels like way too fucking much cash for that old of a card Here's hoping I can wait until November instead
Absolutely The 300 series may be refreshes but they were GOOD refreshes One of AMD's best generations in recent memory IMHO
Would you honestly call Fury Nano part of the 3xx series though They were in a class of their own Reminds me of Radeon VII Anyway Yes They launched at a similar time and were marketed as the top part of the lineup So I treat them as part of the 300 series Your argument on efficiency does stand But in many cases the speed advantage was big enough to offset it IMHO In the case of the GTX 960 vs the 380X 380 the advantage for AMD was very large and the fact that the 960 outsold it MASSIVELY is proof that AMD can be noticeably better and still sell less As for the others 390 and 390X were inefficient but lent themselves to undervolting well FRTC also mad its appearance back then But if someone cared for efficiency a lot 970 and 980 were better overall If not win for Grenada Pro and XT
The 390x came out it was still 5 slower than the 980 and that's 9 months after the 980 had released The 390X was also 430 USD and had 8GB of VRAM which already did matter a bit back then Which is why it kinda attacked the R9 Fury too The 980 was 500 The Fury was 550
That's pretty much where I am I don't give a rats ass about DLSS 3 if I have to pay 900 for it
From AMD's standpoint there is no problem as long as they are selling all the chips they can but it just goes to show that neither Intel AMD or Nvidia is your friend
Turing really was an open goal that AMD fumbled Nvidia's entire userbase as well as the tech press was decrying the utter stagnation in performance and the extreme price hikes and AMD chose that as the time to match price and performance AMD as much as Nvidia killed the mainstream 200 mid range
A 5700 5700XT that was literally broken for about a year Akshually I never had any issues with mine Just getting in early on that one There's a reason I don't have mine anymore
No one said there was a better AMD equivalent to the 2080 ti they said the entire 20xx stack was poor value and it was
5700xt was not broken for a year I got mine on launch and never had an issue Most people who did just had weird compatibility issues with their bloated computers No one missed out on raytracing 20 series was a joke unless you had a 2080ti you couldn't even play rt games with decent fps Not to mention there were like 10 games that supported it during 20 series
As an aside I find pricing is really annoying to talk about online In my country the 6800XT is 300 more than the RTX 3080 In Portugal the 6900XT is half the price of the RTX3080Ti In Argentina AMD cards cannot be found International pricing has become completely arbitrary over the past few years I try to stick to the MSRPs when discussing the GPU market since anything else is pointless Hopefully things become more standardized now that crypto is dead
I can't relate to the 290X bit I had an MSI R9 270X that ran at almost idle fan speed under full load and wouldn't break past 65 C even with my previous case's subpar cooling Not sure what you mean by terribad HD 4 5k AF quality If you mean anisotropic filtering I can't say I see any difference between AF on AMD and NVIDIA cards
Cornering the market has worked wonderfully for nVidia as it has allowed them to create and lock people in to a degree with proprietary technology and it allows them to better control the overall narrative
Yeah that is also true
Not saying I endorse it but we're hardware enthusiasts who actively have an interest in learning about it Most of my friends are gamers first they have no idea about current gen hardware until they're ready to upgrade their PC then will just choose between a x060 vs x070 vs x080 based on their budget and the current prices Not because they're dumb but because they have no interest and just wanna buy the tool to get back to their actual interest of gaming Plus they'll be more likely to fall for marketing for things they didn't need such as RT my friends who bought 2060s for RT can't play any game with decent settings with it lol
Yes I am quite excited Basically a new PC at this point Only things that stayed the same were the case Mobo case fans and storage GPU CPU CPU cooler and psu all new to accommodate Was happy with the previous setup but it could never do VR quite good enough for me so I didn't do VR often This should fix that
As someone going from a decade old i5 2500K to a 7800X3D what is that leap going to be like And I even going to be able to comprehend it
If you have those cards you should definitely upgrade to at least 1440p That's what I run right now and its far better imo unless you do competitive stuff Imo there's no point to these super high end hardware if you're running at 1080p
I could have But my reasoning is that since they are no longer making ANY Nvidia cards they may not have enough cards in reserve for rma and warranties They say they will and I'm inclined to believe them but that's still a risk Also the 6800xt was 150 or so cheaper than the 3080 I wanted And out of all the benchmark videos I've seen the 6800xt pulled ahead ever so slightly at 1440p without ray tracing or DLSS FSR
It s a stupid feature for people who chase fps counters I have never liked dlss or fsr and see them as hacks needed when your gpu can t run decent on native People who always use it because they don t want to see the game properly make no sense to me Dlss is a downgrade in quality for speed It s not better Now they managed to take the speed benefit away with 3
No they are the latest drivers
They are though and are updated with each new release Why would you think otherwise
They are the latest and can be stripped of any extra BS I remove stuff like Experience Ansel telemetry etc from the package People thinking you need a program to download the latest drivers are severely misinformed
Yes they most certainly are the latest drivers
Yes they are the current latest drivers Matches current in GeForce Experience Proof 't need to downvote me just because you were proven wrong
The windows drivers for everyone are extremely outdated Microsoft only goes and certified new drivers every 6 months or so They are outdated for Nvidia amd Intel and pretty much everyone else Nvidias website has the newest drivers day one and you can choose to not install geforce experience
I lost a windows 11 install recently because windows rolled back the drivers for my 6900xt and caused the os to die This problem isn t solved Otherwise the only issue I ve had is the temp sensor stopped reporting with one driver version but was fixed with an update Nvidia drivers are also mixed Had a bad 960 that would bsod Went to r9 fury nitro which worked perfectly and then a used 1080ti which has several driver issues but also has long periods it worked well All companies have driver issues The idea that one is perfect is fanboy talk
I uninstalled and reinstalled windows multiple times and stopped windows updates and tried a lot of solutions nothing worked except amernime modded drivers
Yeah Windows has an issue where the latest drivers are an old version Apparently Windows doesn't check so it updates you to an old driver
I uninstalled Windows multiple times I changed literally every single setting I could find and I tried using different drivers updates the crashes only became a little bit less but I was still crashing Using Amernime modded drivers eliminated the crashes completely so it's 100 not my fault in any shape or or form I still vow to not buy a single AMD product again after this experience
It would be totally unreasonable of me to use Linux My computer serves three purposes General usage which sure Linux wouldn't get in the way of Gaming which until now Linux had far worse support and even now it's still not as good And art where linux is still practically unsupported Just like I haven't minded spending a bit extra on nvidia for things to just work because I troubleshoot computer stuff enough frankly including AMD GPUs which I recommend to friends and family I'm also going to stick to Windows where my programs actually work I'll use Linux when it doesn't get in the way of what I want to do with my computer
AMD had to put in a lot of work to make Zen 3 work properly on X370 They had to disable a platform lock they had put in place that's it
idrc to prove it to you either you were there or you weren't idc on ebay 3090 was selling for 3500 3070 1400
ahh
Well most people don t use the drivers menu 24 7 lol
Steam Deck I guess
rx6600 is 250 and it's only like 10 behind the rtx3060 It's the best priced GPU this outgoing generation though since both AMD and Nvidia are coming out with the high end GPU for the foreseeable future it's still a good GPU
Buy a used rx580 lol mines still going strong
Even a new 570 can be had for less than 150 3 4 years ago This is depressing
Consoles said hello face with tears of joy
Remember RX 480 AMD were EXCITED to have a mid range card as their centrepiece a card for the masses A 200 1080p beast
U paid 430 CAD for GTX 770 back in the day which wasn't a slouch Looks like I wouldn't be able to get a 4030 for the same money
What are you supposed to buy for some casual gaming nowadays Something second hand 3XXX and 4XXX cards are overkill for casual gaming 1080P is very easy to drive nowadays
I remember when high end was 1950xtx lol
Board games
Rx 6600 and up are pretty good for 1080p high on a lot of stuff if you aren t tryna do crazy setting and it is VR ready
Radeon 6600 Description radeon 206600 cm re radeon 6600 14 202 415 Product quicklink true
Casual PC gaming at 1080p ez pz lmn sqz
Consoles unfortunately If AMD raises the prices similarly as Nvidia it will push even more people to PS5 and Xbox Series Hell the Series S is an absolute insane deal at 299 for just regular gaming
the rx 6600 it has an awesome price to performance ration and is quite power efficient on top of that which can save you a lot of many with nowadays high energy prices
Bus width is like this Each memory chip is 32 bits Number of memory chips x 32 bus width So yeah bus width isn't what most people think it means
IIRC one of the things AMD has consistently fallen short on is memory bus bandwith They are trying to make up for it with massive caches's and increasing the Bus on the 7000 series but historically thats been something holding back their cards
Smaller bus means it's cheaper to manufacture And hurt means less bandwidth so yeah it matters
How the cards actually perform IRL relative to what they cost is the only thing that matters lol
tbh i get why the 70 class is getting moved down to the 192 bit bus the 60 and 70s are both built on the 104 dies Giving them the same bus is a good way to simplify production and standards Still doing this 70 class downgrade NOW while selling a 70 class card as an 80 class is scummy as fuck People buying a 12GB model are getting ripped off
Sure but that's a sales tactic everyone uses IMO Surface pricing got out of hand around the SP6 or 7 especially given how they tried to simplify the lineup a but with the dropping of the fun Type Cover colors Still I ended up getting my sister a SP6 bundle like you mentioned for Christmas a few years ago When they're bundling the accessories for the same or less than the tablet's MSRP it's a much easier sell
I know what they and you are trying to say you're fucking morons
Oh i guess that means I misread the slide that said in big letters 4080 12GB I suppose Jen Hsun got the name of the product wrong too You should write to him to correct him because otherwise it looks to me like you're spreading absolute bullshit calling me blind for reading exactly what was fucking announced I don't give a shit if it's a 16 CUDA core display out board if Nvidia call it a 5090 that's its fucking name
The 770 launched like a week after the 780 and the 670 launched several months after the 680 but launches were very different back then Probably if you kept going back it would be a similar story Edit actually now that I looked at it more I think the 770 and 780 were announced at the same time just the launch dates were offset So really you re talking 600 series as I mentioned above
Well there is a 70 card at launch It s called 4080 12gig
When was the last time we had a global pandemic disruption supply demand and logistics of an entire generation of GPUs and the semiconductor industry in its entirety for years at a time
They are thinking These dumb fucks will buy anything we make at any price as long as they think they have the newest toy gotta pad the incoming revenues with inflated prices now that crypto has collapsed and we can't keep lying to investors
Well a delay looks super bad to investors and AMD is going full steam ahead and not delaying So I guess they have to take the L and actually drop prices on the non meme tier cards Prices are set by supply and demand If your costs went up your competition has not and you'll make profit either way sorry time to cut prices Maybe if Nvidia didn't cater to crypto bros they wouldn't be in this mess
The presumption is that they were selling at a loss and it's not an unreasonable one especially for zen and zen with the techniques used being led mature and the prices being significantly lower All of the RnD of chiplets had yet to be amortized and distributed over the successful zen2 and 3 launches It's a fair assumption that power unit costs were high all the while amd was selling low Through some relatively basic analysis we can form reasonable educated and considered hypotheses with the known data That said we can't be sure that's all You make a valid point about epyc although during the zen and zen era I'm not sure epyc was the world beater that it became I'd have to look at market share data from the time
I had that problem on Farcry 6 I had the same fps with or without it because the game was always 100 CPU bottlenecked on ultra settings I think tarkov suffers from the same problem optimization This is on a 5600x 6900xt rig The problem for me with fsr 1 is not so much blurriness but the extreme sharpening that makes everything look grainy FSR 2 has a sharpening slider and that works really well but the difference between native vs upscaled is still very apparent Perhaps it is just meant for 4k Not gonna complain though sapphire nitro 6900xt is the best GPU i've ever purchased dead silent at full load zero coil whine spectacular drivers not a single instability or crash and i get to max out my monitors refresh rate 165hz on most games i've played so far For 1440p it definitely was overkill
Sounds like you are cou bound if rendering lower resolution results in the same fps
Or maybe they've extensively reviewed dlss 2 0 with ampere and you can watch literally any of their last content over the last two years to see that Complaining that they're exploring the new features is idiotic DLSS quadrupling framerate is a game changer
Why would no gamer want that Honestly all the twitch shooters are already running with hundreds of frames per second so it s a non issue and for all the other more cinematic games having better animation smoothness is honestly just great It is also the next logical step The fact it can make MSFS improve in frame rates is awesome nothing pure stupidity about it
We'll see on November 3rd
Dude we're already approaching the limits of EUV now Fabbing with decent yields is getting tougher and tougher to do Why do you think leading edge fabless chip makers like nvidia and AMD absolutely NEED TSMC this gen when Intel and Samsung also have small nodes Why do you think chiplets and 3D stacking are being used Why do you think China spent the last decade dumping billions of dollars into companies like SMIC stole IP from TSMC and western companies and the best they managed to do is a janky 7 nm DUV with yields well below 15 We are approaching limits for inexpensive mass produced leading edge chip fabrication It's going to become too expensive to keep shrinking dies this often Jensen is not going to mass produce consumer graphics cards if his cost to fab chips is at 1 000 per because he knows millions of gamers won't pay 5 000 each for cards Miners Sure Gamers No way in fucking hell
I really do hope AMD has an answer to DLSS and gets their RT performance up soon
Don't be rude now I'm also against NVIDIA's monopoly but we have to be real instead of calling each other shithead I bet you use GPU for gaming only so your point of view makes sense FSR vs DLSS it's debatable which one's better but my point is not about FSR alone It's more about other features NVIDIA provides the features why so many people prefer NVIDIA over AMD even though RTX today is inflated to no end As for Ray Tracing I get why gamers consider it a 'gimmick' Which is mostly true for gamers but not for any other 3d related workspace students designers and basically anyone who might tackle in 3d applications for fun in the future Also any customers who uses or MIGHT use gpus for other purposes than just gaming have no other option than choosing NVIDIA's cards today If AMD doesn't catch up NVIDIA in this regard no matter how competent RX7000's raw specs will be a lot of people will still prefer NVIDIA over AMD because they see no alternatives
Yep Fermi was a hot mess and easily forgotten but somehow AMD is still classed as hot and power 't think AMD can do anything as when they are cheaper and better you see the people just go I'm going to wait for Nvidia to be cheaper and buy that anyway Their single purpose is to seemingly to try and stop Nvidia gouging but they don't get rewarded for it and now sell enough to just decide not to bother with that type of competition The 290x was significantly faster than the 780 and significantly cheaper yet people only remember the fact its stock cooler was bad ignoring AIB partners having excellent models and ran hot as by design somehow people can't comprehend a GPU core being 90c as
I mean to say that things change
Get a NAS and get those old spinners out of your desktop I did that here and my Rig is super quiet
Yeah the uber mode was absolutely horrendous But even with the queit mode it sucked I can't find the exact forum post that laid it out with the teardowns of the cards but you can still find reviews mentioning it The cooler is certainly far from the best we have tested While the dBa rating is not too high at the default settings there is a quite annoying pitch inherent with all of the small AMD fans built into their reference coolers Nvidia can build their reference coolers well but AMD have always struggled With the Radeon R9 290X operating in Quiet mode its cooling fan won't ramp up past 40 and the card remains relatively quiet though the pitch from the fan was audible over the other components in our system page 14
Huh The 390x Fury and Fury X don't count No when you look into what they were and how expensive they were 390X Rebranded 290X originally meant to fight the Kepler Titan 512 bit memory bus 10 larger die size than 980 10 slower than 980 much higher power consumption of around double the 980 around 150 200W extra Fury and Fury X Similar die size to 980 Ti 10 slower 40W 15 higher power consumption HBM completely blew manufacturing cost out of the water vs 980 Ti AMD didn't have any like for like answers to the 900 series They had to either blow power consumption out of the water or build cost out of the water because their fundamental architecture was significantly inferior
More power you use the more heat you have to deal with Good heatsink mitigates the heat so you're right in that regard but that's like you slapping on a huge AIO on the current Intel chip and calling it running cool
Yeah but by then Nvidias already gained all the market share lol at one point 6 of all steam users in the hardware survey had a 970 installed
That sentiment is getting 'm not looking for a vendor to be my friend I just want them to not suck in compensation for my A good relationship with customers is something that companies can sell in addition to products
But for it to not sell there has to be a competing product on offer And there wasn't Had AMD come out with a compelling product offering in 2018 they absolutely would have captured market share just like they did against Intel This victim mentality some AMD fans have is silly If AMD comes out with a competitive lineup this gen they will capture market share It's just a question of whether they are able to design a compelling product and whether they want to price it competitively These two things allowed Zen 2 to win over new customers from a faltering Intel Now is their chance to do the same to Nvidia If they fail it's not because of some made up reason like Nvidia fans hate AMD it's because they either overpriced the product or it doesn't outperform Nvidia Simply matching Nvidia in performance and price isn't how you win over new customers
International pricing seems to be much better for nvidia cards everywhere though
Nice That's great for you I got something like 30fps going from a 3800x to a 5800x3d on my 5700xt
I went from 2500k 4400 3800x 58x3d You'll be quite surprised lol X3D is so good I can see it lasting as long as the 2500k The cache helps out so much its insane
Why not wait for rx7000 then since theyre like a month away
I had no idea I just knew the windows update ones are always behind for basically no reason
So your telling me their plain GPU drivers have telemetry and other stuff baked into them and you don't see a problem with this Also the GPU drivers don't come with an update utility unless you install geforce experience You also don't get all of the features without it
I actually didn't know that However will they actually prompt you for updates with geforce experience You literally loose functionality just for not having an account with them Edit I didn't downvote you don't know what your talking about
That's fine I am not trying to convince you to switch I have had problems with Nvidia on both Windows and Linux Clearly your experience has been different and using different programs and OSes is a part of that I also use my computer for gaming and haven't had too many problems doing that on Linux but that could be down to the games I play It's also true that this was a problem in the past I have heard good things about some Linux software for Art like Krita but since I am not an artist I don't really have my own opinion here All I was trying to point out is that Nvidia drivers aren't nearly as perfect as many people including in AMD subreddits like to think This is especially true if you don't use Windows
Not exactly you could get Zen 3 to work on some version of the BIOS sure but those BIOSes weren't well fleshed out or stable and involved the motherboard manufacturer reducing support for other CPUs on AM4 or removing features This was leading to a nightmare support situation for AMD AMD reworked how CPU support worked in the BIOS which made the situation more uniform between motherboards that had Zen 3 support AM5 has a reworked BIOS and supposedly BIOS FlashBack is a universal feature of the platform this should mean that AMD will have few excuses to keep longer term support
This My RX6600 has been exactly what I needed for 1080p gaming
The 6600xt MSRP just dropped to like 240
This I bought an RX 6600 for my 1440p monitor I play older and less demanding games at the full 1440p In modern games like Cyberpunk 2077 I drop to 1080p and let RSR upscale it to 1440p I love RSR
I'm beginning to feel it's age but my rx580 is really just trucking along
me too I sold my 3060ti and went back to the rx 580
I'm not touching consoles until they get rid of monthly subscriptions which they won't Can't stand the idea of paying to play something I already bought Too many games are always online and then won't even have servers open a few years down the road You can get gamepass but then that's 2 monthly subscriptions just to play a console that will have a bricked library and pathetic long term enjoyment value and monetary resale value
Yea but your experience is diminished and limited it sucks we can t just get reasonable priced mid range GPUs
A console for just Demon souls is a bit expensive
Can't find shipping to Europe face holding back tears
What do you think about the 6600 vs the 6600XT Is it just some 10 15 difference Thanks btw
Except for when AMD did the hbm thing with the Vega64 56 But that had its drawbacks too
Why overprovision CUs with memory bandwidth if they re adequately fed by caches You re just wasting power at that point Also as GPU clock increases cache is also included which means faster GPU faster cache offering more bandwidth often measured in TB s in aggregate Infinity Cache is linked to IF Scalable Data Fabric speed and that s still the same with MCD design This is dependent on memory speed actual operating clock not GPU speed Navi 31 has 384 bit bus width as it s a 6 shader engine GPU vs Navi 21 s 4 shader engine design and 256 bit width It s still 64 bit per shader engine
512 width 290x has entered the chat The only time I can think they actually did it is RDNA2 where they cut bus width and increased their cache by a bunch which is what nvidia just did too
Sounds like a great way to shortsightedly increase profits
Yet their production last year was higher than ever Global pandemic supply disruption Dude it's been 2 5 years since the pandemic started
Dude stop defending Nvidia with zero sense comments and more importantly stop spreading false info for consumers we need to be united against the greed of companies stop being a fanboy
People whinge when they can't buy a graphics card they whinge when Nvidia makes more graphics cards How greedy of them for doing exactly what everyone and their dog was demanding they do Also it wasn't a mining boom it was a global pandemic Jsyk It wasn't crypto mining that made us all have to get new PCs so we could work from home Crypto was not making car manufacturers shut down production because they couldn't get semiconductors No one mines on their car engine management computer
Idk why you're apologising to me but I accept Idk how you figure a couple of Eastern European mining warehouses are responsible for covid but whatever
What are you on about you can check the financial statements it's a public company They had tighter margins in zen 1 days but definitely weren't selling at a loss lmao
I'd say I'm more Tarkov bound than anything else tbh It's very far from an optimized game
Really 15 years ago I could turn down IQ to increase frame rate massively this is a new thing For 20 years of gaming everyone hated doing anything that introduced blur to the IQ film grains were hated matte screen coverings to reduce reflections got removed and then with DLSS we've added it back Exploring new features that everyone rejected for decades that we mocked consoles for using checkerboarding or other effects to reduce effective resolution and fake higher resolutions as being cheap work arounds New features that improve IQ were always and are still welcome new features that reduce IQ intentionally and will always reduce IQ by definition and yet use increasingly more hardware because it's a cheap way to increase performance at the expense of IQ were never welcome till Nvidia started pushing massive amounts of marketing into it
If you don't need input responsiveness just watch Youtube why even play games
AMD needed 65nm gpus when Nvidia had moved to them just like a 40nm gpu wasn't competitive with a 28nm one and on and on They need a 5nm gpu because Samsung and Intel aren't close to the same density or performance 5nm TSMC vs 10nm intel is really no different to saying AMD needed a 28nm node years ago In fact as far as I can remember I think every single generation except for the Polaris generation was made on the bleeding edge TSMC node Polaris being made at GLofo before switching back to TSMC and that generation TSMC Samsung were fairly damn close in performance Frankly most of the industry has used TSMC bleeding edge node for most chips Samsung has almost never led the charge for either mobile chips or gpus only one generation iirc Apple used Samsung at 20nm as TSMC effectively skipped it as it sucked pretty much the end of planar chips being bleeding edge and moved to finfet quicker Apple quickly moved back to TSMC only and had even mostly gone to Samsung for that gen to better negotiate with TSMC but Samsung were left showing they were largely behind TSMC as they always had been before and always have been since Why do you think China spent the last decade dumping billions of dollars into companies like SMIC stole IP from TSMC and western companies and the best they managed to do is a janky 7 nm DUV with yields well below 15 I'm not sure what you think this proves This proves technology is hard but if they stole 7nm tech and the original company could do 7nm tech easily with great yields then another company getting terrible yields doesn't indicate anything except they are miles behind on IP and experience Also 7nm with DUV will always be janky and is presumably because all the EUV machines out of the company whose name I can never remember are bought and paid for years out so China simply couldn't get EUV equipment so are trying to make 7nm node with DUV which frankly is not viable Why is chiplets and 3d stacking being used primarily costs profit and performance Stacking memory brings it closer to the stack and allows potential for significantly increased performance or power saving as seen in mobile or on the 5800X3D Basically even if we come up with some other form of chips that aren't based on silicon and throw the production of computers decades into the future we'll still have chiplets and 3d stacking But yes as said 2nm nodes are probably going to be a realistic financial limit but what I was pointing out is interpolation will only ever make one generations different and if everyone in the industry has to stop at a specific point where performance runs out it really makes no difference is we stop with a full pure performacne native res oriented chips or cut down and room for interpolated chips Interpolation is never going to take us several generations ahead at least not without horrific IQ drops trying to predict 4 5 frames from a single truly rendered one
they do have an answer to DLSS one that is also more adopted so far and chances are will be in the future simply because they have their gpus in consoles FSR 2 0 is really good FSR 2 1 is even better if you are into that then yea i can see how youd rather wait
Also any customers who uses or MIGHT use gpus for other purposes than just gaming have no other option than choosing NVIDIA's cards today Those demands is actually pretty small Most of nVidia card buyers are actually better off with AMD card that focus on gaming It is just like miners They prefer video cards over ASIC because they can resell their cards to gamers And gamers also think nVidia cards are more valuable because it can be used for other things which like miners they actually will never need Why accept nVidia's narrative and believe ray tracing is the important feature in the last several years while disregarding power usage and VRAM size Yes if you do work in ML AI Youtube go ahead and buy nVidia cards But I would say majority of nVidia card buyers do not They just blindly accept the narrative Is visual the only important aspect of games If you must have 60fps with RT on so you can enjoy the game regardless story line etc then nVidia pricing is what you deserve
Yep Fermi was a hot mess and easily forgotten but somehow AMD is still classed as hot and power 's last generation that was a meme in power consumption and performance Vega is more recent in people's memory than Fermi Yeah Ampere is power hungry but so is RDNA2 and they're pretty comparable in performance Thermi was a meme but at least the GTX 480 was fast Vega 64 was roughly comparable to a 1080 at the time of launch in performance and got beat by a 1080ti and since pascal was the last generation before NVIDIA's pricing went insane it hurt AMD even more with Vega being so expensive to produce Hawaii was good hell I had a 390 for a long while but it got followed up by Fiji and Vega both of which were unfortunate for AMD because Maxwell and Pascal were their competitors
I got downvoted just for suggesting switching from Nvidia to AMD or even try Intel in the future they'd seriously rather declare the hobby dead to them
You say that AMD can t do anything but remember this is exactly what happened with Intel just for GPUs AMD came in fighting during Intel s stagnation right as they were expected to go bankrupt within a couple years and it took a few generations but look where their CPU market share is at now the highest it s ever been even higher than back in 2006
Yeah but perceptions take time
I plan on making a second attempt at TrueNAS with my old PC If that happens and I can make it do what I want then I will Also I need to get a multi TB SSD to go in the gaming rig at that point
Sorry but this is a nonsense take By the same logic then nvidia had nothing for RDNA2 because Ampere cards are huge loud warm and power hungry And it's only getting worse with Ada Lovelace where the proper 4080 wants to use up to 550watts now and instead of better rasterization nvidia is relying on motion interpolation to increase performance In 2014 2015 when a consumer walked into a store they could buy AMD or nvidia products of similar power at similar price points
780 Titan Titan Black had 250W TBP for FE cards same ish goes for 290 290x so what are you complaining about Problem with Hawaii cards was that there were no non reference models at launch and then short mining craze started so there were shortages until march 2014 or so
This is fair Nvidia launched first and by more than 2 months big difference for sure This is a fair argument and I 100 grant it to you But the thing there were 260 USD 290s that literally curbstomp a GTX 960 into oblivion and the 960 still outsold those And even when the 380 and 390 came out the 970s and 960s still outsold em
Then don't buy high end GPUs
Whoops just realized I mistyped I meant 7800X3D not 5800 So it'll be even more ridiculous than that haha
Do you think they'll be in stock I certainly don't Same with the new CPUs Didn't go for the new CPU gen due to needing a new very expensive Mobo and new ddr5 ram
Yeah windows updates are behind but going to this page directly you can get drivers on the day they're released
Windows Update has a lag for nearly anything provided through it as it has additional approval steps the various manufacturers do not So any drivers via Windows Updates tend to be released a bit later than they are when going direct Applies to Nvidia Intel AMD etc
You realize AMD's driver package also has telemetry built into it AMD User Experience Program
Automatic driver updating is asking for problems I don't use it on any PC I have regardless of which GPU I use in it As for telemetry it's nothing more than what Windows does already and can be disabled with a similar effort to the stuff on Windows It's an issue for sure but not something to go crazy about
AMD drivers collect telemetry data too Almost every piece of software you use does Your fanboy goggles are on tight my friend AMD is not your friend neither is Nvidia They're both just fucking corporations that want your money
Sorry but if you need a prompt to update then you don't need to update NVIDIA are greedy pricks but there's no need to reach this far to try and shit on them for non issues There are better reasons to do so
Nope they don t force What functions they lose It just seem you just want to hate on nvidia for some odd reaaon
How's RSR on 1440 compared to native 1080 and native 1440
Just adjust the lighting settings a bit especially that SSR stuff and you'll be fine
Same I'm considering upgrading so I can move to 4k but I'm waiting to see what RDNA3 will be priced at in November If they pull an Nvidia and make everything expensive I'll just keep sitting on my 580 for now It's still doing just fine at 1080p
Not to excuse the subscriptions but they give you free monthly games on the subscriptions I haven't been too fussed about the value I've gotten out of it besides multiplayer Also if you just play f2p games like fortnite you don't need the service to play multiplayer
Gamepass Ultimate includes all PC games as well and MS titles not leaving it so it worth getting it via Gold conversion for around 5 a month for me or a year for a price of a full game First I bought it to try PC games then realized an Xbox One X used is cheaper than a used midrange card so got one for 3 years now no regrets so far Also MS Cloud gaming actually works I may sound as a fanboy but before GPU I never considered any subscription but this was to cheap to overlook I still like to buy a gpu once it is sanely priced but until that a console is a good addition to my gaming crave
I built a pc for a single game 3 times in my life in the end I got way more use out of the pcs than just the one game It's the same story for consoles I bought a ps4 pro for ff7 remake and a ps5 for part 2 In the end I am now doing 90 of my gaming on console while I wait for pc part prices to become reasonable again The games are out there the only adjustment to make is controller vs kb m which admittedly was pretty hard for me at first and I still really dislike controller for shooters
Imagine a graphic card
I don't expect you to ship from US to Europe though just giving an idea of a card that actually has a very good price performance ratio is it really not in stock anywhere in your region
I you can get it for only 10 to 15 percent more than take the 6600 xt it s about 20 percent more powerful Where live in Germany availability of the 6600 xt is bad and it s quite expensive right now because it s a discontinued product it it got replaced by the 6650 xt a bit faster but a less energy efficient I bought the 6600 xt in a prebuilt last month but only because there was a special offer and I could get it for the same price like a prebuilt with the rx 6600 I m quite happy with it This week this company where I bought it has the same prebuilt for the same price on offer with a 3060 in it The 3060 is another good value card if you can get it cheap
I think the biggest drawback of Vega wa the fact it was GCN which was imo living beyond its lifetime The HBM was to squeeze out the last drops of performance
That 512 bit bus in no way helped the 290X against the competition
NV has to make it up to their shareholders bc their revenue crashed with crypto it seems The engineering side is still doing good work but man the corpo and marketing heads are trying to steer the ship into Atlantis
Wow you really have no idea how long it takes fibreglass and resistors to go from manufacture to actually ending up in graphics cards and finally to the consumer do you That's before you even get into the backlog that year of lockdowns caused and then there was the Suez canal blockage in the middle of all of that Don't dude me when you are this clueless about international logistics
Wtf I'm a fanboy for acknowledging that covid exists Get a grip
I wasn't saying that I was saying that crypto mining was the main cause of the GPU price inflation That's not up for debate Unless the supply chain Covid inflation was bad last March got insanely worse last May and then returned to bad last July Because that's what GPU prices did those months coincidentally following the same curve as mining profitability
Oh nice You are so much more resourceful than me Would you mind checking the public financial statements and getting back to me with the following information How much did it cost to manufacture each model of Zen1 3 CPU You have so much detail that I don't want you to forget that there is the RnD design manufacture indirectly package assembly and logistical costs for each CPU up the stack Don't forget the included coolers too Because that's substantial especially when they were giving out a Wraith Spire with even a Ryzen 5 1600 How much were they charging distributors and direct retailers What were their RnD costs for each generation and how much did Zen3 benefit from the work previously completed on earlier Zen architectures I have a lot more questions but I figured I'd test your savant like ability to read financial statements in order to offer such astounding resolution into the granular details of allocation procurement and development expenses of AMD from 2017 2022 along with individual cost and revenue analysis of each SKU So I figured I'd start light with a few questions and then ask more once you amaze me with your capabilities to look at publicly available revenue and earnings reports from AMD and divine these details that I was discussing
Because the point of DLSS XeSS and FSR 2 0 is that they don't appreciably add blur Your criticism is massively out of date DLSS 1 0 and FSR 1 0 did what you describe and were rightly derided and hated Film Grain TAA DLSS 1 0 FSR 1 0 Chequerboard rendering are all terrible because they do as you describe but the more advanced techniques don't really Personally I wouldn't mind it if we could all go back to SLI to get native 4K 144 fps or 8K 60 fps gaming back but I don't think that's ever going to happen At the very least that would mean that paying 100 more for a graphics card would get you 60 80 increase in performance rather than the 7 we get with the xx90 or x900 XT At any rate the concept of DLSS 3 no longer just interpolating pixels but interpolating entire frames in order to surpass both GPU and CPU bottlenecks is a fascinating concept and I'm intrigued to see how effective it can be before blindly writing it off like I've seen a lot of people doing I think if this really were as dumb as TV frame interpolation again as a lot of people have assumed it wouldn't be just coming now and wouldn't make use of machine learning
Wait what So you think playing at say 30 fps for MSFS is better than have every other frame added at 60 Like what is the material difference in responsiveness Or better what is the downside Like it s not like your input isn t being processed every 1 30 of a second and since the game is CPU limited there is not much the GPU could do beyond generating this extra frames You are not making much sense
I'll try to make it easier for you to 's needed to produce GPUs while several other companies are burning money trying to achieve the same capabilities MAYBE we're approaching the limits of what we can do at this point in time and we won't be able to make these 1000 metal fun bricks significantly better at drawing pretty pictures anymore Tricks like dynamic tesselation and frame interpolation will buy us more time per node and keep GPU prices from becoming even more absurd than we could ever imagine
Very true The problem for AMD is that vega wasn't actually bad it's just they stupidly chased a high target with efficiency put aside Undervolted saved a bucket ton of power on the vega cards and just drop the clocks down a little reduced power usage by so much Entirely AMDs fault though as it shouldn't be up to users to find that power saving
It's silly really brand loyalty shouldn't be a thing as no company is about customers it's about making money and sometimes those views happen to align but most of the time they don't I'm an AMD fan but only so much as IF their product is equal or better for the same price than the competition then I'll pick them but if they are worse I will pick the alternative as it's better for me the consumer If AMD was in Nvidia position they would also be pulling this to maximise profits you can't blame a business for doing it but people need to wake up and dont assume you can only get from one company before claiming the entire thing is dead haha Sadly suggesting sensible views generally do get downvoted in their respective subreddits these days it's the way people work now
I mean that's not entirely what I meant AMDs GPUs are very competitive and people still don't buy them in significant numbers compared to Nvidia this maybe due to low supply from AMD though as they sell out so they have no need to undercut NVIDIA by much as they want to maximise every GPU sold as it's not like the old days Intel rested on its laurels and AMD designed a gem which truly kicked ass out of necessity Intel sat there with their dominance due to paying out AMD so they couldn't sell and then couldn't afford significant R D due to less money which hurt designs and it also hurt that when they come up with a forward thinking system Intel was market dominant so no one made an effort to support that mindset code wise If Intel didn't pay for their dominance and AMD kept competing then you would probably see it play out exactly like GPUs have for AMD Vs Nvidia unfortunately a duopoly reaches a point where it's unofficial price fixing It's why Intel joining GPU market is so important as it's potentially more open for big swings in pricing as there is more competition and Intel is coming from such a tiny market share so will be able to come in cheap to try and build that up
By the same logic then nvidia had nothing for RDNA2 because Ampere cards are huge loud warm and power hungry Not at all Ampere was built on a much cheaper process node and was actually higher perf W than RDNA2 in tasks it was suited for like productivity AI and ray tracing RDNA2 was just higher perf W in rasterisation and had a similar build cost due to smaller die but more expensive node And it's only getting worse with Ada Lovelace where the proper 4080 wants to use up to 550watts now and instead of better rasterization nvidia is relying on motion interpolation to increase performance The real 4080 16GB has a TGP of 320W I don't know where you're getting 550W from It's significantly better perf W than the 3090 Ti or 6800 6900XT so we'll just have to see what AMD can deliver And also it's worth noting that much like Ampere Lovelace has substantial acceleration of some workloads so it may turn out to be worse perf W in rasterisation but better in RT and AI for example This is not remotely the same situation as 390X vs 980 in power draw vs performance disparity In 2014 2015 when a consumer walked into a store they could buy AMD or nvidia products of similar power at similar price points You could more recently than this too Not sure what you're getting at
What's on the specs and actual idle load figures are two different things I'm not sure why you want to argue about how hot cards ran back in 2014 but you're trying to make an argument for otherwise not me
I guess if you wanted a much larger louder and power hungry card you could get a 290 or 290x I guess different people have different priorities
Haha yes it will
I m sure they will be mining took a massive dive recently and 3000 card availability is through the roof manufacturing capacity seems to be back up from where it was during covid and most people that transitioned to WFH either already built their computer or are back in office now i dont foresee a shortage like what we experienced 1 2 years ago
So now two companies have your data instead of one We give Microsoft shit over this for a reason Hell it's one of the benefits that I got from switching to Linux 6 months ago Now I don't have to worry about data collection from Nvidia or Microsoft
Except I don't actually use their drivers I use the open source ones that almost certainly don't spy on you I also get better performance this way This isn't something you can do nearly as well with Nvidia as they actively worked to block it It's questionable they use telemetry without consent Still not as bad as having to give Nvidia your email name or social media account for GeForce Experience You can't pretend this is equally as bad no matter what you say unless of course AMD are putting a key logger on your machine which is hopefully illegal Although you are right about the latter part sort of A corporation legally should be persuing the most profit but that doesn't mean they all use the same techniques This is ultimately because they are made up of people You also don't need to tell me corporations aren't my friend You're literally talking to an anti capitalist Believe me I have seen AMD pull some interesting anti consumer stunts as all corporations do from time to time but nothing on the level Nvidia has over the years
NVCP task tray icon actually still tells you when there is a newer driver It just won't auto download install
It is an issue though Newer drivers mean better performance and stability Geforce Experience does other stuff besides updates if you want it to Locking functionality just so they can gather your data isn't a good thing when you don't need to do that with AMD
Nvidia Ansel and game settings optimization require GeForce experience Admittedly I wouldn't use the latter but for people who don't want to tweak settings themselves it is a boon
1440p RSR is better than 1080p native but not as good as 1440p native It's worth getting a bigger resolution than your GPU can handle for older games A 1080p GPU could play old games at 4k Or newer games at 1440p Obviously current games at 1080p
They don't give you games They let you have access to a couple new games a month as long as you're subscription is active 360 games are the ones they have you and those are done
Oh they are like on Guess prices will slowly move
I never said it did they said AMD has always fallen short on bus width which is strange since they basically always had large bus widths until they cut them for RDNA2 to cripple mining capability and increased cache instead
i would disagree with stating the engineering side is doing good 450W base line TDP WTF and no word on the massive transient power spike the 3000 series cards had that could nuke a PSU especially with all of Europe's power bills going through the roof im hoping amd knocks it out of the park of Perf Watt its honestly more important to me cooling my place is expensive in the summer heating isnt so much
Except Nvidia didn't offer that as the reason they stated Moore's law as the cause
It is completely up for debate So much so that it's objectively wrong and it's an analysis you only see coming from clueless idiots on Reddit No one was mining on fridges and cars which followed the same pattern We literally just had earnings reports a couple of months ago from OEMs like HP Inc who outlined the impact of supply line issues two years ago finally trickling into production parts this year
I've seen DLSS 2 0 FSR 2 0 the IQ is less bad than the earlier versions but still a large drop on native There is a noticeable blur to everything there are image artifacts there is ghosting less bad doesnt equal good Interpolating entire it's making up data from guessing rather than rendering it purely Machine learning is on this largely marketing bullshit It's just creating an algorithm of best fit it's doing zero machine learning on your computer while playing a game When DLSS came out it was at peak call every new software you make machine learning point in time and most people don't understand what that means Faking frames from actually generated frames by design by definition but literally what is possible and not will never look as good Now if it could hit 99 that would be great but people vastly overestimate how good it is Broken textures are common obliterating intended effects to the image ghosting artifacts are absurd We spent basically a full decade whining about screens being too slow in responsiveness refresh rate ghosting or overdrive artifacts now we are introducing them via DLSS FSR XeSS and just accepting it as a oh well fuck it It's crazy to me
Instead of wasting all that silicon on Tensor cores to generate fake frames they would have been better spent on more Cuda cores to generate actual frames with input processing Vast majority of games are GPU limited not CPU And DLSS3 will still work for GPU limited scenarios without the responsiveness
I'll try to make it easier for you to understand Everything I said was to show how illogical your arguments are Your argument is look everyone HAS to use TSMC because despite competition no one can get to the same level so they have no other choice this proves the limit is close At 90nm everyone used TSMC at 65nm everyone used TSMC because the competition was no good at 55nm 40nm 28nm 7nm everyone used TSMC Samsung was competitive not fully at a single node for the bleeding edge in really their entire history Prior to 20nm 14nm same metal layer they were behind and since they've been miles behind They did good with finfets so largely caught up but fell behind after that If your argument was valid it would work at each of those nodes it doesn't which is why your argument is invalid That's why I pointed that out to you over and over again Intel had 'better' nodes but they weren't good for GPUs for much of that time and Samsung has been around for ages UMC and multiple other competitors came went or are kind of kicking around doing older nodes and TSMC was the only company doing ALL this production for every bleeding edge product Them being the only company they use is literally proof of nothing Tricks like dynamic tesselation and frame interpolation will buy us more time per node and keep GPU prices from becoming even more absurd than we could ever imagine Also no if you have it going into every node then you will have the same gap between each node as if none of the gpus use frame interpolation it makes no difference at all It increases time on a node literally not in the slightest But the limit isn't the point the limit will exist with or without frame interpolation so we can hit hte limit with higher quality native res or slower native res and slightly faster much worse IQ and then we stop and then the software adjusts to that end point wherever it is it makes zero difference which stopping point it is except if we do it without interpolation we can have a higher performance at native
Undervolted saved a bucket ton of power on the vega cards and just drop the clocks down a little reduced power usage by so much Oh god I had a V56 that I bought for a friend on a huge sale for like 2 months before he could pay me for it that card was doing 1650mhz at 90v and would pull 180w for the core down from the stock 250w while performing better with a V64 bios flash since it has samsung HBM2 Undervolting on Vega was so crucial for good efficiency but as you say it shouldn't be up to the consumer to figure that out People only care about what the stock performance will be like Thankfully AMD seems to have learnt their lesson on that and runs the GPUs in a far more efficient V F range now
I m an AMD fan regardless of price or even performance because open source Linux drivers
Ampere was built on a much cheaper process node and was actually higher perf W than RDNA2 in tasks it was suited for like productivity AI and ray tracing RDNA2 was just higher perf W in rasterisation and had a similar build cost due to smaller die but more expensive node Holy moly you're all over the place First off Ampere had to use overpriced GDDR6x memory that gets super hot RDNA2 used normal memory Remember when you said HBM meant AMD had no competitor Lack of consistent argumentation much Second the Vega and RDNA1 were better at mining than Pascal and Turing But were they better at the actual original purpose of a GPU which is gaming No So productivity AI and ray tracing doesn't make up for nvidia needing super hot super power hungry cards with expensive and hot memory to compete in gaming with RDNA2 Your rules The real 4080 16GB has a TGP of 320W I don't know where you're getting 550W from The 550w number was in the megathread at r nvidia Seems they scrubbed it It's significantly better perf W than the 3090 Ti or 6800 6900XT so we'll just have to see what AMD can deliver Allegedly If they were so significantly better nvidia wouldn't have hidden behind DLSS3 and RT benchmarks to make the 3000 series look slow And let's not forget the 4090 take up 4 slots now Sound like they don't have a competitor Also don't try and make this into Ada vs RDNA3 I didn't trash Ada or hype RDNA3 I argued that your argument that AMD couldn't compete had not competitive cards in the 390x Fury X days was wrong I'm not making any predictions on RDNA3 And also it's worth noting that much like Ampere Lovelace has substantial acceleration of some workloads so it may turn out to be worse perf W in rasterisation but better in RT and AI for example And again Vega and RDNA1 were better for mining Doesn't mean anything Most cards are for gamers This is not remotely the same situation as 390X vs 980 in power draw vs performance disparity Is it as bad Perhaps not Is it the same nature of one manufacturer releasing furnaces that abuse power limits Oh you betcha You could more recently than this too Not sure what you're getting at No you couldn't Between The Fury X and the 6800xt 6900xt AMD had only mid range competitors at best That's 5 years Polaris was mid range Vega under performed and RDNA1 topped out at 70 level performance With RDNA2 AMD went back to being able to compete from top to bottom That hadn't happened since the 390x Vega days
Custom 290s were not louder Many were with good coolers and outdid many 970s though not all and 960s But yes they were higher in power consumption Still not that high though And MASSIVELY faster
When do you think it'll be available for retail though Like early December or not until the new year
I disable it via both sources for all my PCs and ask for clients It's quite easy but yes people are far too accepting of it It's also quite funny that a Linux user is on board with automatic driver updates when it's not even available on Linux without third party tools that often don't do it correctly
Go enjoy your 202 is year of linux desktop No one IRL cares
No they don't For both AMD and NVIDIA constantly updating drivers is asking for issues Unless there's a problem you shouldn't update Even the drivers that optimize for games seldom make a difference Better stability is also often a myth Just like I said if your current driver is stable for you don't update unless you need to Take it from a computer engineer What else does GFE do that you can't through the control panel other than automatic updates and game optimization that rarely works
See update from OP here
That is very odd is it actually deformed I have never heard of internal components exploding in a CPU
Can we buy both the board and CPU from you We can pay full retail then you get to skip the RMA and just buy new parts Please email team at gamersnexus it's a dot net not sure if reddit auto moderates emails so doing like this I'll ping the other individual also Thanks
This could very well have been a MOBO BIOS issue especially given the other post was also an ASUS X670
This is in line with the other cases
Same thing happened to me today I was having issues with bsod constantly so decided to reseat everything and did a fresh install Then the pc stopped booting with code 00 on asus 670e e mobo and 7950x3d I was out of replacement day warranty from microcenter Luckily i talked with the manager and got a new mobo and cpu on my 16th day Will try to build again tomorrow I feel that mobo is really bad
I gotta say In my 25 years of assembling computers I've never seen anything like that before Without there being a foreign material introduced Between the socket and the CPU The damage just seems to point 'm really sorry to see it man I would definitely contact the manufacturers I would agree with what other people are saying asus and AMD would probably like to see this
UPDATE AMD was quick to respond and provide a pre paid shipping label for the RMA I also heard from ASUS a little later who also offered replacements It just came a little to late as to reduce downtime and for some stellar analysis content I had already sent them off to Steve folded hands Bless No shade to ASUS though It's only been 1 business day and this occurred end of week Both AMD and ASUS have done a fantastic job in trying to make this right I do feel for AMD and ASUS here as they did request that the parts be sent to them It would have been good to have them get it first to provide an official solution quicker Sorry guys Here are some images I have taken with magnifiers highlighting the damage width 1159 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 57e3e4fb35d9f1a6d2b00b02a984f6be44468017 Here is the full system As for timeline and some additional 7600X has been running without issue since mid February 7800X3D was installed and running 24 7 since the date of purchased Sunday 04 16 23 No CPU overclocking just memory via the EXPO 1 profile F5 6000J3038F16GX2 TZ5NR is on the QVL No issues with temps or performance to date Have been gaming a decent amount on the system Got 30 gains in ARMA 3 Very CPU heavy game MSFS both VR 2x framerate from 30FPS 60FPS and non VR 30FPS with no FPS improvement over 7600X and various other games both VR and non VR CoD Hunt Showdown Rocket League Breachers to name a few Returned home after leaving my system in a typical idle state with nothing strenuous running I don't dismiss the fact that a background task could have been running to the system unable to POST and a QCode of 00 Of which is typically associated with no CPU The AIO was hella toasty upon removal will burn you hot specifically the bracket I speculate the short to have caused the heat Especially if it continued to short while on No form of protection was tripped The pins on the LGA do look intact just recessed and slightly charred I did attempt to update the BIOS to 1101 from 0922 during installation however due to issues with EXPO profiles being unstable and not POSTing I returned to 0922 1101 states Improve system performance and stabilize AMD Ryzen 7000 X3D series processors not that the your CPU and MOBO die and become murder and mystery The last point is my main suspicion and that the BIOS update needs to be made mandatory The sad part is if you do that EXPO profiles will not work for this QVL memory but it is better than frying everything This is speculation I think it is reasonable to think that not updating ones BIOS should not do this Sure recommended but not necessary If so it might be time for the industry to do BIOS updates without a CPU with versions only supporting a qualified list My memory F5 6000J3038F16GX2 TZ5NR is on the QVL But as previously mentioned would not POST with the EXPO profile from the Ryzen X3D stabilizing BIOS version After reading that others were just reverting to older versions when EXPO wasn't working claiming instability I did the same I believe these posts were prior not on X3D processors EDIT After speaking with ASUS it was brought to my attention that the CPU technically isn't warrantied with AMD due to the use of EXPO Which was news to me The board is though through ASUS I have always thought of EXPO XMP as verified approved settings for memory and not so much an overclock Especially since the QVL reflects that This is not the case and in fact the rated settings also vary by CPU so just because the QVL says 6000 30 38 38 96 does not mean that it should work across CPUs With this in mind as I state above I purposely went back to a BIOS version which POSTed with EXPO which was not an approved version for X3D series CPUs and chalked this up to BIOS instability rather than a potential intention by the BIOS engineers So for people on a similar build I'd say just make sure to update your BIOS and forgo EXPO for the time being until we know things are stable and working as intended The cause here is still speculative however may be a good safety measure to take I did spend a few minutes looking for the pinout of AM5 to see if where it is damaged is associated with the memory controller I couldn't easily find anything I will now leave the investigation and speculation to the professionals winking face I did get the same hardware so wish me luck grimacing face I am up and running with the updated BIOS version and I ain't touching any memory timings for the time being Nothing else was damaged As to why the same parts There just isn't enough competition or aesthetically as pleasing hardware IMO I still don't get in a world of RGB manufacturers using non neutral colors on products I'm looking at you MSI with that gold MOBO Remember when Corsair had a yellow logo on RGB products face vomiting Anywho thanks for the support folks Let's see how this unfolds
Seems more likely the motherboard was defective and took the CPU with it
AMD will definitely want to see what happened here I'm sure you'll have an easy RMA and either they'll cover the board or the manufacturer of the board will Sucks to happen on a brand new rig though
Doesn't seem like there's anything interfering with the socket array That's absolutely nuts It looks like a mobo cascade effect Something went terribly wrong with the mobo and unfortunately took the 7800x3d with it I can't be 100 sure though There's a strong chance that it was the processor too Is there by chance any other mobo company that you'd be willing to go to I'd lose all trust after that I've only seen this once in my years On a old LGA 1200 It turned out to be a loose pin on the array and it shorted out It didn't make the processor bulge though It definitely burnt it out Contact AMD first for sure Show them that They will RMA it The motherboard company should RMA it as well That's crazy Sorry for your loss I'd definitely like updated reports on what was the true issue Whether it be the processor or motherboard Please Update I've been searching around to see about this There has been a few case's of 670E E and different processors doing this Wondering if this is a quality control issue on Asus An it's just cooking the processor along with it Because the processor varies It's a few X3d processors now

RMA CPU and Motherboard Hopefully you're using a decent PSU
I had this exact same thing happen to my brand new 3 week old Asus X670E E Gaming Wifi and 7950X a few months ago Absolutely no abuse I hadn't even overclocked anything yet It was sitting idle with just the browser open and I heard a pop screen went black and that was all she wrote Initially I thought motherboard component failure until I pulled the CPU off x200B width 2132 format png auto webp v enabled s f15e54484b1347d79fd23d7c5475712293c5e505

this is not the first case v Rm7iKd9AKD4 Same spot of burnout Asus Crosshair x670 Extreme
You still have warranty send it back maybe your not the only one this happened too
Thatsuh spicy silicon
Very interested what motherboard were you using what thermal paste did you use what was the cooler on the CPU were you trying to overclock it
Shit that's awful On my 7950X3D I've noticed that the motherboard ROG Strix X670E A on default settings gives unnecessery high voltage to the CPU and on load temp skyrocket to the max 89 c and drop the clocks frequency to stay at this temp instantly after start Cinebench R23 multi thread I've found two solution First Core voltage offset negative 0 075 and PBO Curve Optimizer all cores negative 15 Unfortunately there is no more Core voltage offset setting on 1101 BIOS Second Load Line Calibration to 4 and PBO Curve Optimizer all cores negative 15 I'm using this right now Result Same performance lower voltage and temperature never above 80 c at full load
Wow a murder suicide That s wrong
My condolences man
Another 7950X3D dead on an Asus mobo after a few days elses 7950x3d die after a few days
That is more 3D than you wanna have with a 7800X3D
As a STRIX B650E E and 7800X3D owner I am very frightened So I quickluy cheked the mobo bios update guess what Asus has taken down all the previous bios from the page leaveing only the 1409 and 1410 bios This is sooooo self proclaimed width 1952 format png auto webp v enabled s 5c4542c0780406b80785f7d10ef9d0f730f88ca9

If I had a nickel for everytime an Asus AM5 board killed a CPU I would have 10 nickels Which weird that it happened 10 times already

The burns marks on the CPU seem to be off center of the pad Indicates that the pins on the board were not perfectly aligned with the CPU and probably shorted out Very weird I can't imagine that the manufacturing tolerances can be this much off but thermal expansion to this extend also seems unlikely
gif giphy 32mC2kXYWCsg0 Me with Strix X670E F and 7800X3D in a custom loop
Try Contacting AMD
Damn That really sucks pal I d be curious to hear what the issue was From what I m reading it sounds like a Asus issue
This most likely from a couple pins arcing and then overheating the spots you can see the two charred pads Probably an issue with collapsed pins on the lang grid array on the motherboard Or maybe similar
sells millions of cpus like anything there might be some that are defective aka the nvidia burn the cable up
Hmmm this is the second odd AM5 occurrence reported in the last few weeks v 34VbutE Qss
Wow I have been working on PCs since 1989 and I have never ever seen a CPU kill itself physically
Not happy seeing this when my 7800X3D was just delivered today Fucking great I m sure mine will probably be fine but I m hoping this isn t a sign of a much larger issue
Seems like they re stacking that 3D cache really high
ASUS took down some old BIOSes and claims all X3D chips should use a certain BIOS or newer It s highly likely that their older BIOSes supplied too much voltage and burned X3D CPUs alive
I highly recommend as a precaution to anyone using EXPO RAM settings to manually drop their SOC voltage to a maximum of AMD EXPO on certain motherboards seems to be ASUS specific but possibly others is setting high SOC voltages when EXPO is enabled I'm getting 1 35v SOC voltage on my ASUS TUF Gaming X670E Plus and another reddit user posted an even higher 1 4v on a ROG STRIX X670E E GAMING one of the boards most commonly failing The default with EXPO disabled is 1 05v which results in the SOC package power being 10W With the voltage at 1 35v its drawing nearly 21W over double the stock non EXPO setting This power consumption doesn't hardly change from idle to load and a doubling of continuous power consumption just by enabling EXPO is concerning This could all be nothing and normal operation but I don't like a doubling of power consumption from stock settings remember EXPO is a form of overclocking it's bad enough its overclocking the internal memory controller but with it also cranking up SOC voltage and SOC package power by 100 it is looking a bit suspect
My 7900x3d killed itself last night as well Motherboard flashes red light and no image on monitor Rip asus motherboard and cpu sent a ticket to amd just waiting on response now
My first 5800X3D blew up got new one from warranty and been good for 5 months now Finicky new tech
For those who dare
NEW FEAR UNLOCKED I just assembled my new pc with MSI ACE and 7950x3d Yesterday I almost died I smelled something from the pc and I was like DAMN RIP CPU I forgot to peel a piece of plastic well hidden on the GPU xD Plastic started to smell bad with warmer temps while testing furmark and 3dmax I immortalized the pins on the MB before putting the cpu just in case Imgur for ruture reference so if something bad happens I can say for sure pins were good before I hope I dont have to use this picture again you know what I mean In the meantime every voltage is on auto I dont wanna touch anything even downvolting I think can be risky because many voltages are linked togheter and if you touch this can affect that So full auto if something breaks must be mb fault not mine But I dont think those pins were bent since the beginning more likely it's the result of the bulge explosion on that region of the cpu
Never buy any Asus including Asrock zenphone items they are risky
This is the exact reason as to why you shouldnt buy newly released components especially if it is new technology like the 3d caching sorry you had to go through this
This is why I don't buy AMD Intel makes more durable chips
Hell it looks scary Another case of ASUS board X3D chip dead X3D chip It raises questions about both
New r spicypillows dropped
Reset BIOS play with memory By play with memory do you mean you were you changing the vDIMM value before you came home to it being dead Anyone on AM5 needs to pay very very close attention to the field that they're changing when they go to slap in 1 5v ETA I'd also be really curious to know what BIOS revision you were on and if it was one of the variants which allowed CPU voltage control I have the feeling that we're going to see a few more of these
I'd be reaching out to somebody like support mailto support or contact mailto contact to see if they can take a look at this thing Personally I want to see what that CCD looks like Those brunt pins are right under it if I'm measuring correctly on the image
Another Asus Board popping a ryzen x200B why do people still insist on investing in asus motherboards

Sorry for your lost
Looks like a mini heart attack Sorry that this happened to you Hope it gets replace for free
Well this isn't concerning at all
That's unfortunate but also quite fascinating The bottom of the CPU appears to have bulged out and crushed the pins underneath
If within return window do an rma with seller if outside return window then warranty rma with AMD
RMA them is your options If they refuse if you used a credit card it might have damage protection on both those items still Some cards you can get up to 500 per item
That's a short I am guessing socket was faulty Its unlikely cpu had a short It would be helpful to know what those pins do in that area They are probably vcore
loudly crying face I just all my parts ordered and I m building a 7950x3d system with the Asus x670e e
Flynn is trying to get out
This is truly sad I am sorry I can't imagine how this happens without it grounding somehow When I upgrade I may steer clear of Asus
i wuold RMA both it cuold of been the mb and the cpu
Well I wanted to build my system today with Asus TUF x670E WIFI and 7800X3D now I don t
Absolutely terrible But neat
I'll just stick to am4 for the foreseeable future Probably i will max out with a R9 for cheap down the line or a R7 5800X3D who knows
Just download a new socket
Problem with PC's is this could be the PSU Motherboard or CPU at fault and all the manufactures RMA departments will probably blame one another leaving the customer holding the bill broken products
Hello bro I've same problem as u r9 7950x3d are burn I sent cpu to the original shop and repair motherboard in service
inb4 videocardZ with their story
looks like something triggered a short
It saw the cringe marketing slogans on the mobo and decided to end it all
Contact AMD directly If it's a known defect they'll likely comp for both assuming you were operating it within the limits of their warranty In rare cases they might send you a label to ship the chip and board back for them to poke at Although I'm willing to bet this is a know basic failure they can identify with your photos
Well since I just finished a 7800x3d build on an Asus tuf gaming x670e did you stress test it My build finished 24h of prime 95 and 3 full mem86 tests which also took almost 12 hours Passed everything with flying colours Still worried when I see stuff like that
I think it was the psu

No problems here I've had my 7800x3d since release day on a Gigabyte Aorus B650 Elite AX motherboard
That s why gen1 sucks
Could be faulty thermometer on mobo Mobo was wrongly reading temperatures while CPU was baking there for so long that actually deformed some components
My 7700X
About 2 weeks ago I switched to the 7950x from a 7900x and have the Asus ROG STRIX B650E F GAMING WIFI mobo that was part of a bundle deal at Micro Center What's wild is that I noticed something weird looking on the socket when swapping cpu's Initially I thought it was bent pins but I was certain that I was careful when switching to the new cpu After looking at all of these reports on reddit and noticing the same burning mark in the socket as what I noticed on my mobo I worry that I potentially have a problem with my board I updated my BIOS to 1406 when I swapped cpu's and today updated to 1409 when I noticed Asus's support page removed all the older BIOS versions I personally have not noticed anything alarming going on since the upgrade and have been using PBO with negative 20 on the curve optimizer setting
Moral of the story shutdown your computers when not at home
It would be very interesting if someone with a different board could post their volts I would be interested in how many volts MSI Gigabyte Asrock take in idle compared to the ASUS
guys we will all be happy if those of you apparently the problem is not only in asus
OOf I bought this exact CPU and an Asus ROG Strix board Built Saturday tested yesterday and have just set bios to run the CPU at stock I feel like I learned of this at the right time
Hi guys so just build this PC two days ago and after first boot I already have the BIOS 1408 downloaded before I start to build the PC and update it the stock one before windows install My specs are Mobo Asus rog strix b650e e CPU Ryzen 7 7800X3D Ram 2x16 GB Kingston Fury Beast 6000Mhz CL36 So after I install the windows I activate EXPO I and saw that my temps are to high when I first start The Last of Us and building shaders the CPU hit 91 C I immidiatly close the game restart the PC and switch to EXPO II After that on building shaders only hit 75 C But on Idle its stays on 45 C I enter on mobo support page and saw that a new Bios version 1409 was posted and the others disappeared I downloaded install it and after that I saw this post and I panic I take it off clean and reapply termal paste now on Idle i have 42C My coller is Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 a RGB rev 3 I take some screenshots on idle before reapply the termal paste and when I take a Cinebench test I will post it here if I need to make some changes please tell me Now I disabled the EXPO profile in Bios and put a screenshot too Thanks Before reapply thermal paste with EXPO II Enabled EXPO II Enabled Cinebench Test EXPO Disabled I've change the Power Mode on Windows to balance and now I have 38 C on Idle
I just read that Steve from Gamers Nexus has obtained a burned X3D CPU and motherboard They're currently analysing it in their lab Hopefully he can shed some light on this issue
I have a question because I dont understad Which is the real temperature CPU Tctl Tdie CPU Die average or CPU Tdie
Thank goodness I saw this I was almost going to buy the 7800x3d Now I'm looking forward to how Amd and Asus are going to handle this issue
Ive seen few a these in last week think its the chip at fault u should be reimbursed
Rule out any possible user error and or electrical fault and claim manufacturer warranty on both motherboard and CPU
Looks like you had some bent and deformed pins on the motherboard that shorted which could have sent incorrect voltages into that part of the cpu overloading it causing it to heat and swell I wouldn't be so quick on blaming the CPU It may have been but could have been the motherboard that caused it As others have said RMA both
Did the PC turn on on itself since you are saying you came home to it idling
So I have some concerns I ve been trying to build a new setup using the 7900x and the Asus x670e MB but I got my components about a month ago but I am currently still waiting for some parts and actually in the middle of moving My question is should I worry about any of this going around online people saying the SOC voltages should not be increased and such Any help please would be greatly appreciated I don t want to end up putting the build together then booting it up and it dies
In speed rookie's update Basically speed rookie admits to using a bios version which was not intended for the X3D version He covers up his mistake in a whole bunch of text but the only text that is truely relevant is this I purposely went back to a BIOS version which POSTed with EXPO which was not an approved version for X3D series CPUs
Did you drop an iron filing in there or something
What are your options 13900KF
Ask around maybe a YouTuber wants it to analyze
When i see Title i already know that the mobo is Asus one Dont buy Asus mobo with AM5 until they done with silence
Dang I'm receiving my 7800X3D and Asus X670E PLUS today Bit worried right now to be honest But not enough to get another motherboard Yet
admit
When AMD says no overclocking they mean it
Perhaps the defective intel ethernet controllers have something to do with it maybe electrical leakage or causing to many system D Wake me if an ASRock motherboard dies too
Is that liquid cooling Not a fan of those
new adopter tax
Cpu going bad will never cause any physical damage because they are electronic items not electrical items They operate at very low voltage 1 5 1 6 max It is not possible for such voltage to cause physical damage Neither it has any moving parts Physical damage is only possible if the object has moving parts like in electrical appliances like power supply Power supply is mostly electrical Regarding the cpu and gpu it must have been subjected to unrestrained pressure resulting in deformation of both socket and 's terms
Buy intel
That boy got hot I have taken many a heat guns to processors
Buy an msi mobo next time
Probably needed more paste
I hope you deal with good warranty people companies I've never had much luck with retailers and faulty home built PC products it's always what did you do wrong
Glad i didnt get an x3d chip Good but so overhyped
Next time use cpu cooler
Well that's a sucide
Der8auer had a case where someone's Ryzen 7000 killed itself by overheating to death to a point it melted the solder under IHS
Did it leave a note
5 years of AMD cpus per socket right Was only a matter of time until a 1000 bomb like this happens putting modern gen cpu in 5 year aka dated motherboard I just didn't expect it to be a nice top end expensive rog asus myself Now I do expect this to be way worse than the already brushed under the rug xtx 100c memory flop
That s bad and all but why does the first photo look like it has been taken by a pro photographer
ASUS motherboard more like FAILSUS
headstone
I am starting to worry the clearance between the pins is not enough and electric spikes cause short circuit to that is now
Sorry to read that because 1 That sucks Severely 2 I now have to swing the ship toward an Intel thermonuclear heat source uh CPU
Welp ill be checking my 7950x3d that's in an asus rog crosshair x670e gene tonight
Lol Those bent pins were nothing else but human error you can tell based on the pin burn marks on the cpu those pins were bent before it went in
First rtx 4090s and now this holy shit
This looks like a terror attack Jokes aside that's gnarly Rip
Looks like you bent the pins in the socket Can you post a clearer picture
you maybe didnt buy it from the AMD store but from a third party altered tampered or broken by a third party You see the exact same cores and graphics cards from AMD get put in mobile phones you game in better than unbiased rendering on a cheap LG V60 just fine If you were to remove the heatsink fan sure you might get errors or something but zero CPU damage because it steps down power and speed and temps at the hardware level where it senses temps and turns power down to begin with since it can game on a mobile phone battery for like a whole day why the heck would it be frying out and 'burning up' i suspect the pins on the mainboard were in some sort of birdsnest or you bought a mainboard with cheap faulty components or parts that were swapped out with cheap faulty ones like the capacitors for the power regulation
Better get yourself a 13900k and save yourself the headaches w AMD Always something
Should have gone Intel
lol good ol amd
AMD hot beverage
Amd built in features
You forgot the thermal paste in there
Who leaves their pc running when not home Dangerous
So strange
Reminds me of those videos where they overclocked an AMD CPU until it blew up
That sucks You could RMA
fuck me it's raw
Buldgy wuldgy
Was it at default Settings
new fear unlocked
Surprising how recent hardware can easily burn out from GPU to CPU sorry for your chip difficult to say that if it is a cpu or a motherboard
I am really curious which component is to blame here
RMA you do now
I have never seen anything like that Please let me know if you ever get an answer for that the more info in my arsenal the better
Probably something to do with cooling problem
I thought I ve seen a lot Never seen a CPU become a spicy pillow
RMA4 X3D
Maybe that seems to be a short circuit caused a burn should RMA easily
BulgeGate
Fffffffffffffffffff
I'm literally building a pc for the first time this weekend 7800x3d ASUS ROG Strix X670E A Coming from Intel 7700 'm so nervous because like you I also leave my PC on for days out of habit u Speedrookie if possible please do keep us updated with how your warranty RMA process goes Do you know of the top of your head how long Mobo CPU are waranted for by ASUS and AMD
Y I K E S F my dude
Weeell fuck I'm already on a budget build so if something like that happened to me I'd be PCless for the next year or so Always sorry to see something lik this
Whoa this looks nuts We need a follow up of what happened Dat bulge thou
Damn can't say I've ever had seen that happen before Pretty safe to assume this should be eligible for warranty
This could have also been caused by a weird bent out of shape pin that eventually touched the wrong spot on the CPU I've never seen anything like
You leave your computer on when not home I never do that Too much wear and tear to be on all the time Anyhow if not under warranty I don't see much recourse except to go shopping for a new mobo and cpu
I feel your loss It is replecable everything is replecable More important nobody gut hurt or injured you will get a better mobo and cpu quite soon Good Luck
So how hard did you crank PBO
Holly shit that fucking sucks
Looks like the bubble is below the core CCD pile of poo width 850 format png auto webp v enabled s f20a6a7f1ac2049e635af2b376a118211acee18d Did you have a X3D BIOS installed
wow it got bulged did you oc
Oh my God
I would suggest contacting Gamers Nexus first They'll probably buy it off you for the price you paid and investigate the issue Then as consumers we'll get that information We won't get it if you RMA it although that is also a perfect valid choice which should work as well
That's horrible I feel for you
Looks like im gona stick to my 5950x for a while
Hope they don't blame you for physical damage and not accept your RMA because of that
Looks like there was arcing between cpu pads and socket pins I wonder whether there are different socket manufacturer vendors like LOTES and Foxconn in times of 1156 burning out saga same effect like here
Motherboard pins look
Maybe buildzoid or der8auer would be interested in getting them for analysis and youtube money I would contact them if I were you
have you tried to remove everything from the psu and just keep the bare minimum required to power your pc to see if its going to power on cause if it does gets on your psu is broken as fuck
Thats suicidal CPU
I built mine 3 days ago but on ASROCK motherboard This concerns me I'll keep an eye on this maybe cut power at the PSU when I'm not at home just in case
after read the whole post i'm also having issue while my 7950x3d is in idle With a CO in PBO on negative too much aggressive my pc reboot randomly with kernel 41 power error in Windows Logs Only when in idle no problem during benchmarks or stress tests So i decided to go with a 15 on the second CCD I'm still testing
the pins being bent only in that one spot is very suspect maybe this is two things bent pins and then over tightening the cooler both dies burning themselves out of the substrate should be impossible unless the thermometers on die all were broken and failed to throttle the system and even then pcb material can handle well above 110c
Great decision
Intel Welcomes you raising hands
have a 7800x3d as well haven't had any issues looking at comments seems people are having issues with asus motherboards i picked up a gigabyte motherboard haven't had any issues when i bought the motherboard the sales person opened up the box to check and make sure the pins were alright was also told you have 15 days to return the product if there's any issues would contact where you bought it from was also told by canada computers amd gives a warranty for a few years after purchase but it seems so new you could probably just take it where you bought it from was also told by canada computers that they don't make things like they use to back in the day when i bought my new pc few year cpu warranty seems great hopefully it lasts as long as my i7 4770 and lasts me 10 years like my previous system
What an incredible day to read this post I am getting my 7800x3d and my Asus motherboard today '
Contact AMD i think they might be very interested to find out what actually happened and would love to get both cpu and motherboard from you if not do the same for motherboard vendor Usually any manufacturer would love to be on top of issues like that before they potentionally become more common improve they QC future proving In this situation ether CPU was defective shorted heated deformed or motherboard send way too much voltage into cpu
Best you can probably do is reach out to some YouTube tech channels
Seen something very similar with an aftermarket cooler that s been tightened way too much and in doing so it s actually pressed the pins together shorting them out
The forbidden bubble
Did you drop a sweat due to excitement
That's something new Never seen that before Nice share My condolences Your next one's will be gold standard All the best
x200B
You should Definitely get in contact with Debau8r Roman Hartung he'll likely be VERY interested in these parts after some of his recent videos
Does your local electric grid have a good reputation I never leave my PC unattended when on for this reason so I can quickly unplug when shit goes wrong One time the lights started flickering and every single fridge and air conditioner in the neighborhood got fried If you do have to leave it on then at least use a good UPS or voltage stabilizer
Pretty please let us know how it goes re the MB and CPU RMA
Which Asus board is that
Over clocked
So if the chip has minor dark spots it s not usable
My old 3700x lasted about a month But motherboard was fine
Ignore the nay sayers Many here don't understand the core principle of warranties Read the details fine print But also understand that the intent of warranties are to promote maintain customer experience Regardless of the Root Cause no one can say right now the user isn't at fault so both should be replaced even the RAM if its now defective Some smaller companies regional managers like to be stingy and come up with excuses not to approve an RMA but i guarantee if your nice and point out you aren't a routine RMA requester it will go through Make sure you keep a lot of pictures from different angles Label and timestamp the pics and document your interactions
That is a warranty nightmare
My asus x670e extreme has been driving me crazy the led almost never work correctly bios lags boot times are horrendous fails to post often not to mention armoury crate is the worst software ever made now I have to worry about my motherboard and cpu burning out
RMA both may need new ram and check psu
Between the crazy cost of am5 boards and that processor
Money
So should I worry about my Asus B650E I that I just ordered for my 7800X3D
downloaded too much 3d cache
Well this is a horrible thing for a new product I wonder if the RAM GPU and any other AIC's were damaged too
This is wild I have the exact opposite issue I have a Asus 650e i mobo with a amd 7950 just built it and wont turn on wondering if i have a faulty mobo
It stacked itself out
God danm
Dollars to donuts you have that backwards
How were you running it settings wise
7800X3D used Self D 's SUPER EFFECTIVE
Flagship motherboard too isn t it
Damn so
Power spike
It s amazing how a post like this can influence buying behavior I was thinking to upgrade to 7800x3D but I ll stick with my 5900x This post hit into motherboard cpu and memory new purchases Sorry for OPs experience
You know what's interesting is I was making a benchmark comparison video between my 7700X and the 7800X 3D and noticed in the corner there was a bit of that sort of darker almost waxy looking discoloration I found it weird but not sure if it was there prior I may look at it again see if anything's changed I don't want to loose a board as for CPU it's insured
That is incredible No wonder gamernexus wants your setup I'd mount that beauty on the wall of weird Sorry for your lost time but thanks for the post You don't see physical cpu failures like this that often
Wowsers
Wonder if we should undervolt just to be safe until we get an idea what's going on
Very excited for Steve's autopsy
Just got a new 7900x and had to reseat it switch around the ram slots and play with the CMOS battery like 3 times before i could get it working properly
D 've got the same board and a 7800x3d sitting at home right now waiting to get put into my PC this weekend What happened
list full system are you sure its not the power supply that over juiced the cpu
Rma both no big deal pretty sure they will replace both
What motherboard is it I'm hovering over buying this CPU at the moment
Happened to my friend's Same
Let us know when you have any updates for us please update original post
RIP
It looks a lot like water damage to me
It looks like that one spot is a pillow
v ZYDm EzAKQ Could the new BIOS be causing this
Which motherboard
What is the MB so we stay away from it
Not to self stay away from the 7000
might soon join the above 50 at idle on a custom loop and it immediately hits 96C under load started happening yesterday i repasted with cyonaut extreme but still same that being said if i do a prime small fft my cpu draws 170 190W forgot to mention running it on auto on an ASUS board
So this is why they're called Ryzen And I see AMD is already growing 4D Vcache technology the CPU that grows as you use it
Excessive Genshin Impact will do this
I always thought this decision from AMD to make pin system like intel CPU was a bad move
F in the chat oof
That would be the IO chiplet of the cpu So hopefully you can RMA both because the cpu or motherboard could have caused the issue
Take it to task with both manufacturers putting them both to blame man shrugging
Definitely going to avoid Asus and wait for more info on this Don't like Asus at all these days and haven't for a long time
Dude I that's gotta be covered by both motherboards and cpu warentes
Well i always disliked Asus boards cause they are always more expensive just cause it Asus Well now i'm definitely dodging them like a plague when i moved to AM5 Maybe more QA instead of all the BS marketing next time Asus
I'm glad I'm staying with AM4 for the time being No need to upgrade yet But that is terrible Really is
Holy cow I have never even heard of something like that
CPU's are tough to kill The motherboard is the cause IMO Bent pins causing arcing or full contact with the pin next to it
From what I've read from other comments on this thread the issue definitely seems to be the motherboard but I wonder if it could be an older BIOS version that could've caused this ASUS has pushed out A LOT of BIOS updates the last few months
Try to RMA with both companies Heads up AMD RMAs suck to do I sent my 5800 X3D in and after 4 weeks I emailed them and they said they didn t have it in stock and mailed me a 5900X without asking if it was okay When I contacted them about it they told me it was an upgrade and when I said it wasn t for my used they told me to contact them in a week or two I just ordered a brand new CPU and I have been emailing them once a week for about two months now and they keep telling me they don t have it in stock So I need to just list the 5900X and move on I ve seen quite a few other people with similar experiences but that has been on the 5800X3D so might be better with the newer cpu Seems AMD contracts out the RMA work to a third party and they suck
That is DEFINITELY an RMA claim factory defect issue should and probably will be a covered warranty issue regardless of how it happened If the CPU gets too hot it will shut your machine down which is what should ve happened so heat probably didn t bulge to this and if it did it was because it s malfunctioning and didn t turn your system off when it got so hot Either way the CPU is probably warranted for five years which this definitely falls under so RMA both of them and get free replacements That s your only option here is to replace
Damn
F i didn't know this was possible thanks for posting this looks like gamernexus story incoming in a few doing a build myself right now on am5 after 6 years and this is not what i want to look forward too
i would bet the other way around overvoltage overpower overheating and short circut protection are all thing the motherboard is suppose to detect to prevent this to happen anyways RMA time
Apparently you're not alone with your issue is your mobo an Asus one
Very interesting
Asus only X670E only
ohhh faaaaaahk OVER HEAT
about to buy an asus x670e and 7800x3d for a new build but guess I'll wait to see what amd or asus have to say about it
wow those witness marks are close to the pad edges
Same issue in Russia with 7950X3D mobo have been saved by socket replacement just watch first 10m with auto translation
Even if the user was OCing on LN2 which voids warranty something like this should not happen The built in safeguards of both the motherboard as well as CPU will shut the system down if working properly Looking at first picture and the bulge in the CPU guessing something on the CPU side went sideways Both AMD and Asus should RMA a failure like this with zero blowback on the end user
This is fixable with bios update
Damn should I be worried I got a Asus ROG Strix B650E E Gaming Wifi for my 7800X3D
The good news is that you still had a place to come home to that wasn t smoldering ashes Fire avoided achievement unlocked
This looks like a short on the boards side leading to heat buildup there was way to much voltage sent to the wrong pins
which bios number was you using
first time see short circuit in cpu it's the only one reason why heat and gas did this
Other way around
I haven't seen anything like this in my 30 years of being a geek Wow Make SURE you do NOT let Asus away with denying an RMA Same with AMD
ASUS just released another BIOS update for X670E 1202 4 21 23
FWIW my MSI X670E Carbon Wifi only killed itself I hope at least will see when I get the replacement next week and also got stuck with code 00 on the debug LED No apparent damage bulging on the 7800X3D contacts or socket pins Board is dead as a brick though doesn't matter if it's with CPU RAM or trying to boot up BIOS Flashback which ofc doesn't work then either bare it always hangs on 00 and both CPU and RAM LED are on The trigger of it was just pressing the Reset CMOS button while the system was powered down On the next bootup it first showed a code 97 a few times and then switched to 00 which it from then on always shows Picture taken when trying to Flashback after disassembling it before sending it back to Amazon Socket pins
I observed that when closing the CPU bracket the holder mechanism actually pushes your CPU a little bit up relative to the motherboard's direction because the rotating metal bar needs to be turned to the holding position first which makes the CPU off centered I had to manually hold down the mounting buckle to prevent this from happening I really hope that this is not the case here though
Malware cooked it
Did something short That looks like what I d expect to see in a short
Did it kill itself or did the mobo kill it Possible you had some dust or debris on the socket when you installed the CPU Even a small amount may do this if its conductive and bridged the wrong pins
What bios version were you on I take it was an ASUS
I guess I'm sticking with Intel
Defective mobo causing some sort of voltage spike which overheated either mobo or mobo cpu frying 't think Mobo manufacture is going to say they will give you a new processor for free but they'll prob just give you a new 's defective and file a warranty claim
Just a suggestion the stock TDP and the cooling are not sufficient for any if the ryzen due to more cores Also due to boost freq the heat may be more Manufacturer have to consider this into account while designing for pcs laptops although this issue looks like some electrical
Sweating profusely here with my x670e e and newly installed 7800x3d
Hypothesis During IDLE something strange happens with these CPUs and Windows Something may start running and starts to overheat these CPUs Based on this story and somebody elses story claiming the power bill went up when left idling away from home Perhaps some screen saver kicks in perhaps iGPU or perhaps NET optimizer or Windows file system defragging
Probably should update the title of this thread considering it seems highly likely that the motherboard is at fault not the CPU
Oh gif emote free emotes pack feels bad man
Another idea hypothesis that popped into my mind is the following 1 What if the drilling into the chip to connect the 3D V Cache causes air pockets or micro fractures 2 Then the chip heats up and this air expands 3 Resulting in a bulging or explosion internally H
Is it clear now which version of BIOS is faulty and which not
So ASUS thought its good idea to reply it doesnt cover warranty if EXPO memory setting used And what about GN doing video about them and if they find something wow talk about bad press and mishandling situation Doesnt make AMD look good ether
Interesting I have an Asus X670 P waiting on a 7800x3d to install later this week for my brother I'd imagine either Asus or AMD or both will cover it to save face
Well crap x670e e and 7800x3d owner here Guess I m screwed
Updated to 1409 and everything is running smooth got like 25 more points it heavens gate to
How on earth does this happen I feel for you WTF That's a new CPU and MoBo Please tell me RMA is possible

So for anyone else that has an Asus Board and running an x3D chip what can we do about chip degradation could these voltages although not killing the cpu could have adversely affected its lifespan Recall

did you try turning it on and off again

I've been seeing a few post like this with the 7800x3d a youtuber had his melt to his socket rma both and if motherboards rma won't g et accepted talk to and about it
Hey i have a amd rx 550 2gb and i Wonder what happends if i increase my gpu Power idle with a 230 watt powersupply
Hey what happends if i increase the power idle of my amd rx 550 2gb with a 230 powersupply will i get More Performance

I have the 7800x3d with a ROG strix b650 a board Is there any video that could walk me through the steps to check and fix the problem if I also have it

Ahh yea it's Asus of course

Is that socket designed to be replaced I've never seen that before but it makes sense in a world where overclocking is common paste goes bad and overheating processors damage motherboards Isolating possible damage to a replaceable part would be pretty smart Here's some reading to think on Can You Replace The Cpu Socket On A Motherboard Expert Answers TechReviewTeam text So 2C 20if 20you E2 80 99re 20considering 20replacing 20your 20CPU 20socket 2C to 20properly 20align 20and 20secure 20it 20More 20items
I planned pick that mobo to 7800x3d xD So for now i'm little confused idk which mobo take any tips
I don't know if it was mentioned but apparently ASUS was is overvolting the CPU with their drivers Gamer's Nexus posted a couple videos about it
may want to check with your mobo manufacturer regarding the Bios version It's unfortunately a known issue So far with my MSI X670e Carbon is safe I have the latest bios update 7D70v174 Beta version
The CPU pad is physically bulging I imagine there was just too much heat on the contacts causing the pad to expand Not that the CPU has an internal component which exploded

Yeah there seems to be an issue with a thermal protection on some of these CPU's
Gonna try to hijack this to help some people out The standoffs being used are wrong picture was posted lower in the comments those are for am4 if you have an asetek cooler that came with a backplate it's not compatible with am5 the z axis is but wrong Also the kit for the right standoffs is sold out on Amazon sold by asetek and I haven't found it elsewhere If your new 7000 series is running hot and you're reusing your cooler check it now before it's too late
The deformation comes from extreme heat or arcing Much higher then what you would even use for soldering It was definetly a long short Was there something else in your home that has a short

already getting excited for the new video
Holy hell
There is a youtube channel from Russia a guy with a team who mainly repairs GPUs They already have 2 motherboards from Asus and 3d AM5 CPUs in repair that burned in the exact same spot socket is dead cpu is dead too They said more mobos and cpus are incoming to them WTF AMD ASUS width 857 format png auto webp v enabled s 62a1bb7338cdb450d48cef0b7d66eef614f8847c

So I am guessing there are several instances and GN is putting together an analysis from multiple sources Great
I was here put me in the screencap Hi mom
This is beautiful Gamersnexus truly are gods amongst us mere mortals

Looking forward to this
Hi Steve lmao
I suppose that's one silver lining of this situation Really sucks for OP though
Oh man I saw those pictures and was really hoping for an in depth comment but this is so much better really looking forward to hearing about what the hell went wrong here
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
Excited to see a video of how on earth this happens Go good guy Steve

which exploded I FUCKING LOVE THIS GUY SO MUCH HOLY SHIT CONGRATS OP
Thanks for your service
Many people in the other post suggest Asus being rather generous with voltage and x3d chips are quite sensitive to higher voltages temps Definitely send them for RMA perhaps contact some youtube outlets as well this is a pretty interesting failure especially as it happened multiple times well interesting for us not so much for you and your heavily burned expensive hardware Good luck
The other post also mentioned a x3d cpu
I see the problem here It's clearly that there's no thermal paste between your socket and CPU pins
I remember when Asus boards where a
ASUS is just selling more boards than anyone else the conclusion that it is an ASUS problem just because something happens on an ASUS boards twice might be misleading
There s tens of thousands of these Asus X670E boards out there if this was an issue with that board in particular we would ve known about it months ago
Ordered a 7800x3d and Asus X670 should I be afraid to assemble
Have you tried pairing another CPU in the same motherboard or is it actually gone
The bulge is in the same place on both CPUs Both posts are using Asus motherboards too though I wonder how similar those boards are
Thanks
Asus motherboard is the culprit in both cases
oof now i'm nervous about my 7800x3d
Is x670e a flop Thank god im buying B650e i
Seems like all the asus mobo have problem is the 670 series 650 is fine
You gotta love microcenter
Totally worth it to get the CPU warranty from them It actually covers overclocking
tate with nothing strenuous running I don't dismiss the fact that a background task could have been running to the system unable to POST and a QCode of 00 Of which is typically associated with no CPU CPU reviewers need to stop testing with EXPO XMP since they claim that breaks warranty until the manufacturers change their tune
After speaking with ASUS it was brought to my attention that this technically isn't warrantied with AMD due to the use of EXPO that's a load of crap you should be able to run XMP EXPO and still have warrantee apparently after research its technically not covered but its more of a don't ask dont tell policy having XMP or EXPO 99 of the time will probably not cause any damage to your system if you have an issue and they ask if you have XMP EXPO enabled just say no they have no way in knowing that you had it enabled anyway
I highly recommend as a precaution to anyone using EXPO RAM settings to manually drop their SOC voltage to a maximum of AMD EXPO on certain motherboards seems to be ASUS specific but possibly others is setting high SOC voltages when EXPO is enabled I'm getting 1 35v SOC voltage on my ASUS TUF Gaming X670E Plus and another reddit user posted an even higher 1 4v on a ROG STRIX X670E E GAMING one of the boards most commonly failing The default with EXPO disabled is 1 05v which results in the SOC package power being 10W With the voltage at 1 35v its drawing nearly 21W over double the stock non EXPO setting This power consumption doesn't hardly change from idle to load and a doubling of continuous power consumption just by enabling EXPO is concerning This could all be nothing and normal operation but I don't like a doubling of power consumption from stock settings remember EXPO is a form of overclocking it's bad enough its overclocking the internal memory controller but with it also cranking up SOC voltage and SOC package power by 100 it is looking a bit suspect
To me on the photos of the CPU's pads it looks like the pins never made proper contact with the CPU This could have been caused by a bad socket out of the box
Your situation is eerily the same as 'm however at the stage of getting a 7800X3D 'm however posting fine with EXPO 1 and EXPO 2 on X670e f bios 1004 with CL30 6000 Was planning to update it to some higher bios version tomorrow before swapping to the 3D cpu but now I'm considering waiting with the whole thing until someone figures out something I do have some issues with the other statements though Not by you ASUS by itself in default factory settings do far worse things with voltages than the EXPO profiles do compared to what the stock AMD settings should be The crap their x570 strix does to my old 5900x at stock settings is hilarious It's running at 30 40 more power than it should according to AMD A 've done so retroactively Originally didn't plan to get a non 3d cpu myself
What cooler did you use I am wondering if pressure from the cooler may have bent some pins causing a short
what does the surface serial say Specifically I'd love to know the lid etchings
Edit overaction on my part hwinfo shows the correct clocks It never when up to 5 754 in the first place I'm kinda afraid now Same as u I upgraded my 7600x to a 7800x3D Same RAM I'm on a STRIX B650E board though No overclocking except EXPO 1 The highest I've seen it boost is 5 794 MHz Which should be totally out of spec if the limit is 5 MHz The Asus bios might be auto OCing it past the limits I sure hope that's not the case width 494 format png auto webp v enabled s 0c7c7ddf8a67a04c63061e000437d5947d9a256f
I wonder if ASUS was already aware about 1202 just earlier in the last week 15 16th My BF also have a X670E F with a 7700X But for some reason I can't post with EXPO set by Ryzen Master EXPO applied through BIOS only works alright so I haven't think too much about
Have you contacted AMD directly about the RMA I have exactly the same problem with a burned out 7950x3d the dealer who sold it Microless has been silent for a week now
I had a 7950x3D that died on me with a ASUS X670E F motherboard within a short time but there were no bulge or marks on it and the motherboard survived It was also running 0922 BIOS as that was the newest BIOS when I built the system and EXPO settings for RAM Died while pc was left idle doing nothing and got stuck with DRAM light on MB after reboot No overclock on CPU I'm getting a new CPU but this got me a bit worried about how fragile the new x3D CPU's are
Meanwhile another terrible discovery has been made ubTZKivlg x200B
Does anyone have a good motherboard recommendation for this cpu for buying right now and did they release a bios update yet to better suit this chip I have been holding off because of these issues coming out but I ve been ready to buy it for a few weeks
Basically speed rookie admits to using a bios version which was not intended for the X3D version He covers up his mistake in a whole bunch of text but the only text that is truely relevant is this I purposely went back to a BIOS version which POSTed with EXPO which was not an approved version for X3D series CPUs
Getting my 7800x3d and Asus mobo Friday Gulp
It's a direct CPU failure Happened with fresh MSI boards too
Hopefully the board is covered I'd say the CPU is a given but the board is up in the air tbh You could probably check with either gamers Nexus or der8auer on if they want the whole set up for evaluation Der8auer did a non x3d CPU 2 weeks ago that unsoldered it's self
Yeah just gotta warranty both OP will get replacement parts for sure
How can you explain that others mobos like MSI was with same problem I guess it's new X3D chips failure

Keep your warranty info up to date and be prepare with backups That's really all anyone can do really regardless of CPU or Board Shit happens and it can happen to any of us at any time
On the upside if it happens you get the opportunity to talk to steve from GN
with a Crosshair that's insane
He's not r9 7950x3d are burn Odd that it happened in the same exact spot too If there's already 3 cases on here there's likely more out there that aren't posting on Reddit or online The theme so far seems to be all were using Asus boards Asus might have dropped the pooch on this one maybe Too early to say for sure though

Where is load line calibration on that bios I have a 7800x3d Nvm Digi vrm Thank you for this tip
Just got my X670E Gene this morning Using it with my 7950x3d which I got a few weeks ago Manufacture date of the Motherboard is August 2022 First thing I did before even powering on the system was bios flashback to latest 1202 bios I did have one sudden power off when I was dialling in my fan speeds scared the brown stuff out of me All seems stable at the moment although my 7950x3d which was running on a X670E I ITX board previously does seem to have gained a few degrees with this motherboard
I have a 7900x3d Crosshair x670e combo and I started smelling hot plastic I saw your post and set curve optimizer for 15 all corees Thanks for saving the day
I have the same X670E A Strix on a 7800x3D what was the high voltage you were seeing on your mobo
u darkezowsky they just released a bios update 1202 on 4 21 23 really interested if you upgrade or not and if so what if any changes occur
Thanks for that CPU LLC4 lowers temps quite a bit indeed Also lowers the Mhz so Im unsure about the performance statement But I'll take this over running at limits This together with the CPU SOC change to 1 25 which was default on 0805 with OC I'm feeling OK running this long term
Why d it work with a 7600X then
I would set some hard power limits max wattage if possible
I suspect a lose pin made contact with the edges of 2 pads and shorted them or shorted power across them I've seen similar things on Intel LGA1200 and LGA1156 boards before
As far as anyone knows right now it's the users that are defective with that it's extremely hard to see it clicking and without using a flashlight to double it closely I wouldn't trust it Those big Y cables going to 2 4 PCI E power cables doesn't help either with how much it can weigh pulling down on the connector
Watch buildzoids vid about Intels Asus x99
Same boat Just got it in the mail today I was deciding on my MB and had chosen the ASUS Strix E E guess now I won' My current PC is more than adequate so I guess I'll sit in the CPU for a bit and watch this Kinda feeling like I should have just done an Intel 13700k like I planned before every reviewer said the 7800 X3D was Gods gift to gaming I hope it's just an anomaly or some type of user error like the 4090 cable melt
Could you indicate where on the ASUS BIOS settings you can limit the SOC Voltage
Does this affect ITX boards too
Worrying for the longevity tbh
You also have ASUS board
Play as in after it wouldn't post remove a DIMM
Seeing this an hour after I ordered my Asus M
because for these people like me who have no issues with asus motherboards based on your logic people should not buy a nvidia gpu because of burning connectors due to user error
Cause I nor the guy I gave a ASUS board to has never had an issue
I had one kill an x99 cpu One of their stock voltage settings was way too high
Because blanket statement ing a brand isn't smart A or two ago it was Gigabyte getting the heat Before that it was ASRock You have to judge brands on a generation by generation basis because they make so many products within so many different product cycles For all we know MSI could be the trash brand on Ryzen 8000 and Asus now has the best
Asus is the goat
May the PC gods be in your favour folded hands
Might be worth exchanging the board at this point imo If it's already built I'd just say to keep backups and make sure you know your warranty info
I did a 7800X3D build on 04 14 2023 and have had zero issues I'm on a Strix B650E F

O D
Which are you using in Bios 1409 Expo 1 Expo 2 None
thanks for the useful information how many mhz is your ram in that case does your ram support a stable 6000 mhz or not
I can tell you in my case there was zero user error I have built literally hundreds of PCs and repaired even more then that from 8086 XTs all the way up to current day stuff PC Mac Mainframe Motorola 68k VXWorks etc The build was pristine with a healthy thermal paste application Temps were very cool and the H150i I had on it initially was brand new and working perfectly Judging by the 5 BIOS's rapid fire released by Asus for this X670E E and all the mystery USB drop outs disconnect reconnect issues I'm having with this mobo I'm guessing it may have some voltage gremlins going on somewhere Also the first board that failed and my replacement both share the same USB issues
Pretty sure the bent and deformed pins were caused by the cpu bulging at the spot If they were bent like that it would not have survived several days of running

definitely buy intel it was obvious that they would break something when they changed sockets am5
Lol this is the worst take I ve ever read CPU s pull a massive amount of amps and are certainly electrical Do the sums a ryzen at 1 2v 140watts pulls 116A It could go very wrong Just the heat alone could melt the pins
Well the speculation on that one if I remember correctly is that someone tried to delid it with a blowtorch or something
Dude whats up with you commenting nonsense everywhere AM5 is a recent latest AMD socket that came with ryzen 7000 The previous ryzens were on AM4 This isn't an old

There is clearly plenty of paste and contact area on both the IHS and the cooler surface

I would get a motherboard from a different company not just for the possible issue of burning CPUs but also for using a shitty I 225 NIC

Just return Asus and grab something else Asus rn is killing shit on AM5 and I wouldn't put any money close to it
Update the BIOS to the latest from Asus then boot into the BIOS and search Memory Context Restore and set both to Enabled That will most likely fix your weird booting issues
To add to your woes the B650E I uses the pretty terrible Intel ethernet controller which may or may not cause you massive headaches
Stop order and get the Gigabyte B650I version
PSUs do not push voltage it's not able to over juice anything unless something asks to be over juiced so to speak
Asus boards All of the known cases have been Asus boards
The next gen mb are going to say I double dare you
Asus sleeping at the wheel
RMA both
Sadly Ryzen 7000 seems to have a slight quality control issue RMA it
Was the PC off when this happened or did you leave it on and go out Also how long after your purchase did this happen I ve had my 7800x3D with an ASUS B650e f for about 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary apart from my MoBo LAN chip having issues resolved now once certain protocols were disabled Kinda have me worrying I run PBO Tweaked and AI Suite Extreme face with peeking eye
is it an asus motherboard Oh wait i think i see republic in the second picture
For that to expand like that the PCB has to have shorted and then delaminated
Thats not possible Too much heat how much 100 C cpu throttles at max degree It cannot more than 100C Itis not impossible for cpu to cause physical damage at that temperature Because they are made keeping in mind what will happen if cpu is run at prolonged period of time at tunjction max Atleast in warranty period The most probable is that cpu can fail but won't cause any physical damage Otherwise all mobo companies will sue Intel or amd for ruining their but it is just independent
Should have listened to steve at GN instead of spending money on a chip that was nothing but a marketing gimmick
Yeah I was doing some benchmarking for a comparison video between my 7700X and 7800X3D and noticed in the corner there was what looked like a bit of a darker spot I dont know if it was there before but may remove cpu to check
Sounds like the high temp shutdown failsafe failed
Definitely some sort of electrical failure I would guess either bad contacts or a serious board failure fried the pins with arcing then blew up some components in the CPU I have never seen actual deformation usually just burn marks
Gamers Nexus want to buy both your CPU and mobo
hey if it's that much in disrepair and beyond recognition you wouldn't happen to remember what the serial numbers on the lid were right I am specifically speaking to whether you remember your's had a bottommost column for D I couldn't say what this stood for but all the unboxers and spokespeople' lids were with the D this I did note
That very poorly applied
What AIO is that
Probably some capacitors that got boiled and exploded Which raises all sorts of questions about the voltage involved
cache
There s your problem Why would you put cash in between motherboard and processor What purpose does it serve Also i suspect it being 3d cash you probably put a large stack in
It is a little late for thermal protection when there is a localized lighting strike in the CPU socket That is high hundreds to thousands of decrees celcius

Hello my child Your dad and I are very proud of you You are a great person and becoming greater every day We love you
Hi mom
History being made right now
Hi mom
They truly dine at lord gaben's table
Which motherboard
perhaps contact some youtube outlets as well Gamer's Nexus has made some offers as of a couple hours ago after your post in a couple of these similar threads I wouldn't suggest going around asking but I'm sure they'd welcome some extra data and maybe pics as swell It would look great for them to say We have these couple of samples and reports w evidence of it happening to XXXX other people and these are the commonalities or whatever
As do I I miss the price and longevity of my Gene VII and VIII
There are tens of thousands of vehicles on the road with a large percentage having been recalled had issues or been lemons There are thousands of components on a MOBO where only one in the right spot has to be off spec Secondly to your point there has been very little usage with X3D processors on the platform
Motherboards even in one line aren't some monolithic thing that either work or don't Within the same product line even on the same day at the factory you might have any number of components from different suppliers coming in You could have 4 lines making 4 batches all with different inductors capacitors and resistor suppliers and as long as each supplier meets the specs the parts would be interchangeable If some supplier had a bad batch or ever just a fistful of bad samples you could have boards in some serial number range that are much more likely to fail than others
All the dead X3D chips are from X670E mobo so far
Also tens of thousands of 7800X3D are you saying OP isn't having an issue
Good point Storm in a teacup really
Return it and get 650 Idk why manybpeople buying 670 eventhough its more expensive
Return it and get 650 Idk why many people buying 670 eventhough its more expensive
also i just remembered asus x670 gene killing buildzoid's 7950x
Probably the exact same but that doesn't matter the pin layout is the same regardless This is quite interesting
Luckily I was going to avoid Asus this time anyway because their software is dogshit
Yeah I'm staying away from Asus
Asus motherboard is the culprit in both cases And how do you know that And how do you know none fail on boars from other vendors Considering they are a popular brand it's not at all impossible that both just happened to fail on Asus boards
This is the motherboard killing the CPU and not the other way around
I would be too if I discovered my CPU can spazz out and die at any time flushed face
Flash news Dont buy qn Asus motherboard with it Almost like asus built products for AMD is garbage See their laptops having less cooling on AMD variants
I wouldn't be there is a warranty for a reason
what makes you think this has anything to do with chipset B650e still uses the exact same socket
Just luck I guess and hope I haven't had this issue and neither is it mentioned in any review
AM5 is a flop
Yes i read all the issues with same motherboard I got a new msi 670 ace mobo now with additional replacement warranty just in case if it doesnt work Will try again when my new cooler comes tomorrow
For replacing defective components barely 2 weeks after purchase
I would if I had one
Apparently it's been happening to other X3D CPUs in the same exact spot Seems to be a design issue sadly
That is correct Nor intel or AMD technically cover any form of xmp it's been the case since forever Although as you said they have no way of telling you done any of it so nobody really cares unless you mention it
Yes you should But you don't EXPO XMP is partial overclocking and since the newest GN vid lays suspicion strongly on the IO part of the chip it really looks like these problems are connected to IO overclocking Same for PBO the fact it's a BIOS CPU settings makes people think it's official but it still voids the warranty Crazy world we live in
im glad im not the only one who thinks that that was my first thought ive seen pins just ever so slightly be off and create a perfect scenario like this
Yea this looks like the cpu was fingered and left residue so the pins did not make good contact with chip You can see from the swelling on the chip it was heat related and poor pin contact will do that Always clean the chip contacts before installing You might not of been the one fingering the chip but the person who packaged it I have only seen this a few times and each time was from someone finger f'ing with the chip and leaving the oil from the skin or other contaminants on the contacts even though you can't see any This is why I am not very fond of LGA chips though that's where it's all going towards
That is something I was wondering as well because when I was testing my new parts I had used an old noctua tower that had the am4 bracket screws and when I was tightening it all down I was wondering if I wasn't using the am5 bracket screws I might cause too much pressure since it may or may not be 100 compatible with am4 so i didn't tighten it very far Then I assembled it on my main build after realizing the motherboard i got didn't come with hdmi dp connectors I also made sure to buy the am5 screws that I only needed for my water block because they were different I'm assuming the height adjusted correctly for am5 at least for my ekwb That's the only reason why I was so cautious with the old noctua cooler
Steve GN actually reported that if you rocked a previous CPUs you will have a performance issues even after updating the chipset drivers etc etc etc and ONLY a full full clean Windows install fixed the issues Im wondering if and how this could be related to the issue
I had HWMonitor running in the background while playing persona 5
Did you reset your cmos after upgrading And I mean like using the clear cmos button I am curious if this is because the bios is getting in a corrupted state and does weird crap I have seen similar things with the gigabyte x570 board toggling some settings never seem to turn off right and after upgrading the bios i get weird crashes until I reset the cmos
I have an X670E A and 7700X Same experience can't POST with ECO enabled in Ryzen Master I instead set it manually within the BIOS That said I upgraded to v1202 on Monday and disabled EXPO and PBO curves so I'm on totally stock default settings now except for enabling ECO mode PC now boots up in 30 sec vs 52 sec
For those that have an AMD Graphics Card check your driver's version too comments 1 comments page 1 comments 1 comments page 1 Recommend you get latest driver to prevent GPU driver from overclocking your CPU
Was that MSI failure posted somewhere Or do you remember what board it was I have an x670E Carbon that I just installed so I'm wondering if I should keep this in mind
Do they All I've seen is Asus which is making me paranoid as I own the Asus x670e hero and 7950x3d It would make me feel a bit better if it was actually other boards too I got the microcenter warranty so if something happens with the CPU I'm good if something happens with the plus it's a 700 USD motherboard Maybe gonna lower my fclk a bit so I'm not pushing right up against the limit Idk But it's other boards too
The chance of a vou failing a lot smaller than a motherboard failing Given that the damage is external on the socket side with evidence of arcing and burning I would look towards the motherboard Power comes from the board not the the cpu
I literally just got my 7800x3D in today Although I went with the Asus B650
Of course a 1000 100W PSU would give issues s
Yeah between the weird booting issues USB drop outs and 5 BIOS updates in like a month I'm starting to doubt my choice of Asus for the mobo They usually do a pretty good job and I've used a lot of their mobos in the past without many issues For what it's worth I was running 0805 when it failed and the first thing I did when I got the replacement motherboard was update it to the latest BIOS just in case that has anything to do with the issue
Google search X670e have double the chiplet vs B650e maybe that design might have cause this basically double the power voltage available that might overvoltage the cpu
There were more then 2 pins bent and when I installed the CPU 3 weeks prior those bent pins were definitely not bent They bent when the inside of the CPU exploded and created that small bulge on the bottom The sound sounded exactly like a capacitor exploding minus the magical blue smoke and nasty smell at first I thought a motherboard component failed and was expecting to smell it any second but never did
3 year warranty for each part is nice If something happens it'll probably be within that time frame
3 isn't significant on the total of 7000 series sold But these know 3 to all be Asus boards is statistical significant
Not just Asus boards but a specific model of Asus board so far the x670e e What's really strange is that I wonder if they are sending a specific amount of voltage to that spot on the socket since it's the same spot on both x3d chips
Wouldn't be the first time as Asus board has caught fire Definitely a hardware issue I bet AMD and or Asus will want to look into this Good luck
I like Asus but I'm hearing people having issues with their boards as of late Even Jay from Jayztwocents who used Asus extensively decided to try something else because of issues Still it's really difficult to know if the cause was the Mobo or something with the CPU
Fuck me I am putting together a strix 670e e and 7800x3d this afternoon Edit Got everything up and running Ram wasn't working at 6000mhz and I was almost in tears and wondering why didn't I just buy the aorus 670E Turns out it was Asus being a dumb ass The Expo 1 profile is Asus's profile to overclock the ram which will work but will crash to Bios setup on the next boot Expo 2 is the ACTUAL default profile of the ram which was stable for me After turning on memory context restore and power down I was golden Great job Asus s I hope they fix the issues but I won't hold my breath on things getting better anytime soon EDIT 2 I tried tweaking timings more but then it crashed and now I can't get 6000mhz no matter what I do Good job Asus
Must be gremlins as we know asus has no reputation for quality control issues or highly unsafe voltage with their AMD products

I'm glad it helped LLC lowers the Mhz but PBO Curve Optimizer boosts higher frequency on lower voltage to compensate but after reading all of the issues that other people have I'm not sure whether to use it anymore I'm going to update the BIOS to 1202 and probably stay with LLC 4 without PBO CO to not take any risk Screenshots of my tests in Cinemabench R23 Stock YsQ 5120 1440 LLC 2 Z3vIeN 5120 1440 LLC 4 DAYnn2B png 5120 1440 LLC 4 PBO Curve Optimizer 15 Eycj7D 5120 1440 BTW I don't have any screenshots but the results are lower on 1101 than they were on previous BIOSes
Defective in design not manufacture
All this shit in the thread I am reading about ASUS makes me feel like I dodged a bullet or two in my time I usually traditionally have been putting together ASUS stuff since the Pentium III days always very reliable and my daily driver laptop is a ZenBook The only reason my current gaming build isn't a box of ASUS parts is 100 because of scalpers and I am suddenly feeling very lucky about that
No clue but I would assume so I was using an asus tuf 670e If you have amd expo turned on turn it off apparently it causes unsafe SoC voltages that dries your cpu motherboard
I would run some serious stress tests while in the return window with these

Gotcha I've seen a few other users post screenshots of their BIOS while tuning memory and accidentally entering DIMM voltage adjustments into the CPU field on some boards these entry fields are literally next to each other On a typical Intel or even non X3D AM4 5 system doing so will just result in a CPU that's likely to hit thermal limits pretty fast and most users will notice that things are amiss at this point A quick trip back to the BIOS to undo the goof and they're off to the races If your board was shipped with or flashed to one of the specific Asus BIOS versions that allowed voltage control on X3D CPUs it's conceivable that a similar mis type would result in the CPU popping similar to what happened with Der8auer's 7950X3D in Taiwan It's also possible that there was a bug in your specific BIOS that delivered 7950 non X3D levels of voltage either via Asus auto OC or through faulty default detection That's why I was curious about the BIOS version to see if that's a shared symptom The catch with the above line of thought though is that in Der8auer's case there was no dramatic burn mark and the motherboard was undamaged Yours looks like it experienced a power plane short either via pins or via some fault in the substrate between pads It's really really bizarre Of course I hope you're able to get it sorted out and if my original message came across as accusatory I apologize I was just trying to work out some of the ways in which damage like this could occur and the vDIMM vCore transposition is common enough that it bears mentioning I came back to the post a bit late but it might be worth reaching out to some of the techtubers to see if they'd be interested in taking the defective CPU and motherboard as a set and directly replacing them for you Some of them have the ability to do some pretty low level analysis with traces and power components that might be able to shed some light on it in addition to possibly taking a look under the IHS to see if there was a physical chiplet issue foreign conductive material debonding or some other fault of the substrate for example Keep us posted if you do go this route or learn any other details that might help pin this type of failure down
no that's not my basis of 'm not working with hersay or exclusively off the contents of just reddit in 's not generally the greatest
Asus in the past was caught doing some auto OCing that were causing some issues way back when So i wouldn't be surprised
i do judge brands generation by generation and asus has absolutely dropped the ball repeatedly across numbers models with varying degrees of failure ranging from a bit of an annoyance to causing customer and technical support frustrations to having catastrophic data corruption or failure We keep records on this and actively try to avoid it and one reason lab testing is done to validate and QC QA before pushing mass deployment So prior to 2017's full scale launch of am4 where testing began for it I was testing obviously previous sockets chipsets as they came and making recommendations to businesses and customers Suffice it to say Asus has consistently been the go to for basically over a decade i've still systems out there running be it intel or amd in fact for the first time ever one system came in due to HDD failure only that was assembled in 2005 again asus So this isn't some kind of bias take or something that is just thrown out there on a whim I've concrete data that i'm paid to collect and work with numerous businesses some of them international giants in order to facilitate the most likely best outcome in terms of a problem free stable reliable operation going 've stated in other posts starting with am4 in 's offerings generation after generation continued to be the worst mostly across the board compared directly with other brands and when it first happened i actively sent the boards back because i honestly thought they were faulty Colour me surprised when asrock the previously bottom feeder consistently and repeatedly landed at the top of the list over and over and over again AM5 testing hasn't fully completed but thus far asus doesn't appear to have learned from their am4 mistakes which is disapointing There is FAR to much blind brand loyalty to my asus board works fine mentality is all well and good but that doesn't account for what is often better since ignorance is bliss and what is being tolerated is considered likely better than what other brands are because asus is the best Now i'm not saying things aren't just exploding in people's faces all over the place but having dealt with 100's of 1000's of machines and specially dealing with the numerous arguments in which people claim AMD's ryzen platform is just inferior to intels outright is often due to people buying asus boards and slapping their ryzen cpu on it and then running into hair yanking situations I have to deal with many of these people often daily to which IF WHEN they bring in the machine a board swap to something other than asus often resolves the problem though preferrably to an asrock board rather than msi or gigabyte since too many cases in which that has resulted in trading one issue for another and I preferably like to just avoid all problems best i can x200B ANYONE that has work in QC QA with significant pressure to ensure shit just works knows that you best not screw

ASROCK B650 PG LIGHTING
1 April I just watching youtube read websites then my pc suddenly turned off Bios v1 18
The first two photos are taken with EXPO II and the last one is without EXPO All of them are taken on bios ver 1409 On EXPO I the temps are with 10 15 C higher and I don't want to risk activate anymore
My Ram are Kingston FURY Beast RGB 2x16 GB Cl36 AMD EXPOtrade mark Certified KF560C36BBEAK2 32 with 4800Mhz stock but with max of 6000Mhz and I don't have problems running at 6000Mhz I have only two options on EXPO profile 5800 MHz and 6000 MHz The pc was stable on memory testing and gaming No crash no bsod
I will look closer when I am home on my PC as I can zoom in better than on my phone But from what I can see now I have to disagree Here's why The orientation of the deformed and bent pins How some of them are bent straight out As if they where yanked to the right If the bulged was able to cause it unlikely because of how socket pins are designed they would have bent in different directions around the bulge Not all of them going one direction to the right even though they are on different sides of the bulge Something had to sweep across them to bend them in that fashion A finger perhaps The bulge itself could have taken place over a period of time So yeah it could have survived days of running with it degrading every day from heat and each day it bulged a little more until it failed Edit To further show it was most likely bent pins that caused this check this out almost identical pins caused by his finger utm source share utm medium android app utm name androidcss utm term 1 utm content share button
Well that's going to increase your risk of auch a thing happening just by the statistical chance growing That's why you set the PC to auto sleep for example Also there might be significant power savings to be had Letting my PC sleep for 6 hours a night instead of having it idle at 100W saves me anywhere from 70 90 annually depending on the current energy prices
1 2v It consumes current doesn't mean it is electrical component You are confusing electrical component with electricity Electricity is just a unit Pc fan also consumes electric 't necessarily operate on fixed voltage Now don't say smps is electronic just because it contains chips and function as a dc current supplier to its connecting component Smps has electrical component like rectifier which converts ac into
I don't remember any mention of any blowtorch It was assumed core sensor died or had temperature offset problem that lead to overheating and failure But it's not something common to say all AMD CPUs have such issue or even many
Lol screw that im thinking of creating backup plans with intel again Intel cpu intel mobo peace of mind Only wanted to try AMD because everyone and news outlets were raving about it and like 300 cheaper for the featureset i wanted
I ve cancelled my orders for 2 ASUS motherboards But all other options are so much worse value for money it seems At least where I live
Isnt Gigabyte cheap though They are known to be cheaper
RMA the motherboard for an issue the CPU caused
Gamer Nexus just offered to buy them at retail
Looks like an ASUS board Good luck with that
TIL reddit doesn't know how warranties work
First CPU that s ever died on me was a 5800X3D last year Got it replaced and it was gold It s not just AM5
Was the PC off when this happened or did you leave it on and go out Read the post He said he came back to it idling with full fan speed with an error code
Nah I leave my main system on 24 7 Bought the CPU on Sunday
Seems like Asus is having a bit of an issue
Does Reddit have free useless comment awards I can give Sorry I don't know I'm new here I must say I was rather pleased with my frame improvements in ARMA and MSFS
Should have listened to steve at GN instead of spending money on a chip that was nothing but a marketing gimmick I thought that was the 7950X3D 7800X3D seems respected if not as universally loved as the 5800X3D
It's a good thing every single computer user knows who Steve is and what GN is
Circuit board CPU delamination due to heat which was caused by bent pins on the motherboard See the dark spots on the pads They are right on the edge and probably shorted with neighboring pads OP isn't telling us everything
Ahhh bruh If applied correctly there should be a very minimal level of paste as if its flush it will move away from the IHS Secondly thermal protections exist and IF which it is certainly not a thermal run away it would throttle and shut off Not likely seeing it was sitting idle Temps have been perfectly fine under load
Even if there was no thermal paste this couldn t shouldn t happen The CPU would either throttle or shutoff
Wat
Looks like some Asetek part given the mount
Just looking at the image I was actually curious Outside of the small bulge on the left side There's actually a really large bulge on the right side of the processor I can't tell if the shadow from the image but it looks like it almost takes up the whole right side Does anybody else see this or is it just me
I just bought a secondhand R5 3600 It's boosting to 4 1GHz 1 45V Everywhere I've checked says it shouldn't exceed 1 35V for degradation reasons Again that's stock untouched bios settings I have hotkeys set in windows for manual clock settings of 3 6GHz 1 05V and 4 0GHz 1 2375V respectively Fans won't even ramp up at full load on prime95 small FFTs at 3 6GHz
capacitors that got boiled and exploded There are no capacitors with electrolytes there There are just ceramics Those don't boil
wouldn't be the first time ASUS got the voltages a bit off on a new chipset

Well put
More GN content Here we go boys
I'm in the same boat I was just about to pull the trigger too haha It's disappointing to have to wait but this is better and we may get a nice board recommendation
Same been waiting for it to release in my area It's already priced higher outside US if the board or the CPU has an issue it could break everyone's wallet

As I know he didn't say anything about the reason they have only theories for now what happened They ordered new AM5 sockets to replace them Here is a screenshot for second dead socket and 3d cpu from them Also Asus width 709 format png auto webp v enabled s ff19e7b922c6afc98025e5ba0a765627da2a34cf
So far yes AFAIK this is the first 7800X3D previous few were 7950X3D
Well i think you'll change your mind if you see what i just posted
Hi mom
I am using the AMD X670 Extreme from asus as
Cool thanks for the updte I wouldn't suggest going around asking but I'm sure they'd welcome some extra data and maybe pics as swell It would look great for them to say We have these couple of samples and reports w evidence of it happening to XXXX other people and these are the commonalities or whatever The reason to ask ahead of time is that GN might want to purchase the motherboard and or CPU in order to examine the failures rather than OP RMA ing the components I believe they did the same with faulty 4090s during the 12vhpwr failures
A little sus indeed
Looking at my 7950x in my ASUS motherboard right now with suspicion and mistrust
u buildzoid did you uh have a bulge on that 7950X
Pin layout would be same but the mobo could still cause this via a number of different ways
Every mobo manufacturer's software is dog
I will always avoid ASUS Their prices are usually higher than competing brands for some reason even for products of the same segments Add the higher prices to these stories of failure and it's an instant avoid
Well I have Asus x670e so still bad news
CPUs fail on other boards
Only on this specific asus motherboard So it's a mobo issue not cpu
Not all people have a warranty for example to make a valid warranty for me it costs more than 200 BC I need to send the processor to the US and it isn't
Because all i see total 3 post all same issue is on x670e chipset and not 650
person facepalming
B650 have no this issue
AM4 first gen was nothing to write home about either It's just the price you pay for early adoption
clown faceclown face
Im curious why not just get the 650 strix Its more realiant never seen any issue no stupid external dac thinghy and cheaper Im personally buying B650e i today for 7800x3d
No for being local and being liberal with their return policy User was 1 day out of return window and the manager at the store was kind enough to stretch the policy to allow the customer to return replace the equipment
Igor debunked this theory because it's just a few VDDCR VCore pads that were affected and it happened on different motherboards with different socket manufacturers Let's see what comes out of this
Can you share a link to Steve's comment regarding full OS reinstall Thanks
you only need to change windows if you had a 7950x3d which has core parking and other dual cccd features and change to a single ccd cpu like 78700x3d
you really should use
Before installing the new cpu I did reset the bios to the default settings In my case HWMonitor just gave bad info HWiNFO gives me the correct clocks According to HWiNFO everything is within spec
I saw that on a Russian tech channel you can turn on English subtitles whole video is about 7950X3D issues 35 He mention other reviewer from 3DNews Russian reputable tech site got an 7950X3D and an MSI Board and CPU also died
Yes I've seen few cases with Hero boards and at least one case with an MSI board 7950X3D in every case
Hold onto your butts
Lol you ll be fine
A lot of my issues are not just ASUS but the AM5 platform tbh I've only ever build one complete PC although recently upgraded the GPU and it has performed flawlessly since launch 5900X As much as I want to upgrade to the 7800X3D and AM5 I would really regret it if I had issues I am also worried about spending a fortunate on an AM5 board the 'cheap' boards where I live are truly awful only for it not to fully support zen 6 in a few years for whatever reason AMD are a bit hit and miss on their future promises
Oh weird yours has the bulge too Maybe it is the CPUs and not the motherboards after all I'd love to have one of those boards to see if the 12V rail is shorted or not
And all of them x670
Many outlets trashed Gigabyte and Asrock for the AM4 motherboards but it looks like they are the current AM5 leaders Disclaimer I have a rock solid B450 Pro4 mATX Asrock motherboard
Didn't he use the crosshair hero
I switched to them from gigabyte and MSI and I totally regret it Their software is janky and they are so slow for updates that improve stability
Same with me im using the same board and chipset for my first amd build
I am about todo the same next week face with tears of joy can you let me know how it goes
I discovered that on my own as well back in mid Feb with my Asus X670E A mobo 7700X and G Skill RAM Once I figured out EXPO II was working I left it that way that is until this whole X3D fiasco Now I'm on BIOS 1202 with 100 stock default settings no mo EXPO with only ECO mode enabled now At least it boots in 30 sec now instead of 55 sec
I don't think that's what would cause this
Dude legit went your system died next time void all your warranties
1 This is not thermal damage That would not have likely damaged the socket and the PC would have failed immediately under load This one was fine for 5 days per another comment from OP The board also seems to have taken a greater heat load than the CPU substrate suggesting that the heat started in the socket 1 Thermal shutdown would have stopped the system around 118C regardless 2 It being fine for multiple boot cycles also suggests that there was no foreign material in the socket either as that would have either stopped it from booting due to poor contact or killed it on the first power on 2 The IHS contact looks fine and so does the amount of paste applied You should have a thin layer like that between the IHS and a cooler It's only there to full micro voids between the surfaces Victim blaming is not the answer here 3 Delidding itself carries so much extra risk that I cannot recommend it to anybody not into extreme overclocking You have a much greater chance of killing your CPU by delidding than you do by using it normally 4 Making any modifications like the one you suggested to either Intel of AMD CPUs will void your warranty I'm not sure where different companies stand on contact frames but I do know that even using one of those to replace a stock ILM carries the risk of a voided warranty 1 This would only make the RMA process of a chip that would have died anyways impossible or extremely difficult Leave your chips alone unless you can afford to buy another one right now
What 't be surprised if Asus currently knows something lol actually have a 7800x3d coming to put into one of these boards x670e f so this is going to be 'm on the bios just before now so I still have the offset
Hmmm Not sure if it s comparable but my 7950x3D gets a better score than yours not substantially on Asus Rog Strix B650E F motherboard on air cooling I think the Asus enhancements and PBO are on in the BIOS it s not running the latest bios just released 2 days ago Not sure if I need to rock the boat by installing a new BIOS and potentially risking instability The beta bios caused a lot of freezes in the BIOS to the point I could no longer change any settings without reflashing a previous version which makes me very reluctant to try out new BIOS revisions unless I have an issue
Good info I upgraded to 1202 on Monday on my Asus X670E A CPU is 7700X I reset to default stock which disabled EXPO II that I was using and PBO curves 20 on all cores Going to keep it that way until this fiasco is resolved That said I see you too are running L Connect 3 Not sure if you knew but they recently finally released a version that supports minimize on startup
Was you on the latest bios Also did you limit SOC voltage at all
Well I think until the end of warranty we'll be fixed soon enough
I so maybe ASUS just use too agressive voltage for X3D chips H
loking back at your pictures the faliure on the cpu is in a diffrent place from the other x3d chips that have let go almost as something let go in the substraight between the chiplet and the io die under the ihs have you updated your bios prio or during use of the 7700x and how have tempratures been before it let go
There is the other guy who had the same thing happen to a 7950x3d also he posted a picture of his cpu socket later on in the thread width 960 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s a3e24419c1f3d1b9907ae0a5ca446f95d22bcffb width 960 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s a3e24419c1f3d1b9907ae0a5ca446f95d22bcffb Sadly the picture is a bit weirdly angled so it's hard to see as good here but it's rather strange that there are several failures of the exact same nature on the same spot
Sure increases risk of something that should never happen Plus it was idle with low usage
This is like literally saying cars overheat sometimes so if you are going on a 100km trip you should stop every 5 minutes Pretty dumb logic
Well nobody really could understand how that kind of temperatures would happen because it was like close to 200 degrees needed or something for it to melt S
I finally jumped over to AMD this time because I always had the impression AMD tends to have these weird issues until now and the intel options seemed stupid as far as power draw etc The price and performance seemed to be a no brainer And yet here I am seeing a weird AMD problems post and now I'm nervous

Yes That motherboard is definitely unrecoverable What else would you do
Yes cause both items are damaged and you are not sure what damaged what in the first place It might be a mobo voltage supply or a cpu issue so both should be RMAable
We also dont actually know if the CPU was the root cause Could have been the mobo could have been the PSU who knows
The motherboard is also dead as a result and it clearly wasn't user error so yes It's covered under RMA
you guys have this backwards motherboards kill CPU's not the other way around So yeah the motherboard needs to be RMA and they need to get him a new CPU
Not necessarily a CPU problem The bulging there is a point heating issue which could well have been caused by poor contact on a power rail The motherboard's socket can easily cause that
otr the motherboard killed the
A the motherboard for an issue the CPU cause who is to say that the CPU caused it Could just as easily have been the motherboard a short or something electrical overstress
Your conclusion is premature Could be the inverse
That cpu ain't doing anything on its own without that motherboard So yes they're connected
Both have AMD chips inside And they both are at fault if none had the guardrails for this to happen
Y they need to provide you with a replacement of both Good example could be a brand new PSU from a reputable manufacturer exploding and taking the system with it But it doesn't really matter what the component is The only thing that matters is whether it is apparent what caused the problem The only problem in this case is which component actually caused the problem because its to that manufacturer you need to file the claim Maybe in this case the damage was caused by a blast of power through the motherboard and perhaps even then it originated from a PSU error
How do we know the cpu is at fault what if the contacts of the moba caused the issue The nvidia 4090 plug frying itself issue was cause but inproper contact of the plug
Wouldn't leave out the possibility of a faulty CPU socket causing this issue tbh
RMA both when returning the MOBO say it caused the issue When returning the CPU say it caused the issue The manufacturers most likely will accept that
We don't know 100 which one caused it There was weirdness in the past with Intel boards where different boards would play fast and loose with the timings and voltages which caused the CPU to be essentially OC'd out of the box without the user realizing So perhaps something similar is happening here Although I'd try AMD first as it's more likely the CPU Pretty sure warranty covers replacing the part as well as any part damaged by it Same way how if your PSU kills your system the company who made your PSU needs to payout for thr test
Both AMD and the Motherboard manufacturer are going to be incredibly interested in this It s not exactly a know fact at this moment that the CPU caused it Yes the CPU bulged but that may have been because the motherboard did something
Most likely the Motherboard did that to your CPU The Motherboard controls the regulation of power not the CPU The vast majority of the time when a CPU fails nothing happens to the motherboard however when a motherboard goes that can take a good CPU down I while not working consistently because of medical issues have been a technician for over 2 decades and have fixed recovered PC's since the late 80's I even had to build a computer from components electronics not GPU RAM etc I have only ever seen a CPU take down a motherboard once It had a manufacturing defect and had excess solder that when it overheated before throttling and shutdown protections the excess solder leaked onto the board and shorted a capacitor and a MOSFET It went BANG So I wouldn't put anything on that board even if you fixed the pins
How do you know it's CPU caused Could've been the motherboard sending the wrong voltage or something else
How do you know that the CPU was the cause AMD Ryzen CPUs have different parameters to prevent this issues PPT TDC EDC limits This looks like if the motherboard ignored the voltage and current limitations causing the CPU to burn
There's a chance it was the motherboard that was at fault Pins could have been touching or something
So that means all 7800x3d are going to cause these damage thats scary
Where do you think bios is at rolling on the floor laughing
Am5 might have more issues but you never know with just one off examples Faulty cpus as a whole are very rare
Any and all CPUs have the chance of dying
My 5800x3d maybe killed my x570 board when I moved it to my kids PC after I got my 13700kf Went to boot it and nothin Tried 5800x3d in other board and nothing 5900x worked fine but other board dead as fuck Wondering about to be fair i don't know if it killed it grain of salt and all that but both board and cpu are dead and the cpu doesn't post in another board It could have been other things it certainly didn't melt the socket or anything but it's certainly an odd occurrence
Sometimes you can just be unlucky My previous setup late 2016 had a defective 6700k that I RMA'd right away even though Skylake generation was incredibly reliable and performant at the time
My first CPU I ever needed to RMA was i5 6600k bought at day 0 It had random freezes issues Till that day I thought CPU either work or not
The whole 5000 series has issues My brother had his 5900x dead on arrival or at least it would bsod all the time I remember there was que a few people with this issue online back then I bought his RMA replacement and it has been good so far but I have been building computers for my workplace and am enthusiast for over 15 years now and it was the first time I've seen so much problems with CPUs themselves
So it seems to be the new tech in the 3D series Id say its almost obvious but we will have to wait to see
At my old house I ve had power outages where my PC would turn on after power restoration even with a surge protector It was just a question my guy
His CPU almost blew up and he had an error code on screen
ye but was it off to start with
AI Suite Extreme for what
Nothing wrong with 7950x3D bought it and it works perfectly for my usecase Not everyone use their CPU only for gaming
I doubt OP had a good look at the CPU socket while this was happening Considering this has happened in the same spot for other users with the same board it is probably an engineering or manufacturing defect jumpstarting failure Could be the CPU as well but who knows with only a couple cases
I'm not convinced Poor contact between pins pads due to manufacturing issues could have caused the heat build up leading to the bulge delamination causing the pins to move to the edges of the pads I have seen numerous intel CPU's that have failed due to poor pin pad contact causing the pad to disintegrate They can occasionally be recovered with solder if the internals have not been damaged
yea my first thought upon seeing it was a short
To be fair if you keep it running 24 7 you had no idea what was running there when you were away Windows often decides to run anti malware or updates when idle which can load the CPU quite a bit
Ok good for
Yes I did read about faulty AMD
It's not a bulge I did notice this during installation its a slight difference in the color of the contacts on the CPU Even after wiping with iso it remained Something caused by the manufacturing process My guess is its benign and a red herring
Yeah i can see what you mean
1 45V is perfectly normal stock operation when waking cores up to 1 5 actually but wont persist for even a second Dont try to manually overclock or set fixed voltages on Zen2 it requires harmful voltage to approach stock performance and not being able to spike voltage briefly screws with boosting waking cores Everywhere I've checked says it shouldn't exceed 1 35V for degradation reasons Either Zen1 or pure misinformation The max safe full load voltage is about 1 15V to 1 2V depending on who you ask and the exact CPU The CPU will adhere to those values unless the motherboard is some Asus CPU killing crap with stock applied overvolt Edit are you even in the right thread here
You are confusing manual voltage and auto voltage Zen CPUs have an entire subsystem that controls voltage current at a microsecond scale It's totally normal for auto voltage to hit up to 1 5v on a Zen while taking into account temps load and time Meanwhile manual voltage is more like a firehouse throwing the max amount of current possible at the specified voltage and all protections are disabled So to be safe you have to use a lower manual voltage If you are using PBO it's totally safe since the protections are enabled and it auto adjusts voltages to safe levels In general using manual voltage and clocks on a Ryzen is both less safe and typically results in lower performance
fine subscribed xD
Holy hell
At this point Asus should just give up on am5 leave it to gigabyte they doing a lot of crap this gen
I despise Asus I ve only ever owned an AM4 board from them but it was horrible The BIOS was janky unorganized and would crash randomly Clock speeds where instabile and at odd numbers So much for premium products Ended up going with MSI again I planned to try out something new and it worked perfectly
replacing socket won't tell you much Issue could be elsewhere on the board
That's 3 sockets with bent pins All in the same spot Unless the bulging cpu bent them
That is what the offers were I didn't want to look like I was extending that offer or anything inappropriate on my end just agreeing that they're worth contacting if one has the same problem even if it's just contributing to their data pool
Yep someone should tag GN Buildzoid to have a look at this maybe But so far not too many incidents If more keep popping up in the future then there is definitely a pattern
I see what you did there
Same here just with a 7800 D
Undervolt it Just to be sure
A perennial truth like death and taxes
I got their 2020 G14 It's has been the worst laptop I have ever had 9 out of 10 times it doesn't wake from sleep use hibernate now Power plans are all over the place with fan speeds Randomly uses 20Watts at idle when on battery Charging port lasted 1 5 years Never again Should have stuck with ThinkPads
Wasn't always the case I have an ASUS board from 2011 which has been running nearly 24 7 for over 10 years the hard disks in that PC clock over 100 000 hours without any faults or issues whatsoever and it wasn't even an expensive board
Rip
I have the same combo coming Kinda sus
Is your shit already built
Me2 I stress tested with prime95 and memtest86 for almost 30 hours total so I hope I m good
Undervolt immediately and set voltages manually
This has only been happening on Asus X670boards
Plausible but not a given CPU may be misbehaving due to mobo inputs that are unommon across models but in spec Hard to diagnose further without time spent with physical hardware
idk seems to me more like an Asus issue rather than x670 issue
just to let you know B650 and X670E use the same basic chipset promontory 21 The X670E board just has 2 of them chained together
They didnt have an asus 650 in stock and i couldnt wait much since its my work computer as well This is the first time going with asus and it disappointed me
Msi Asus motherboards In my experience In terms of reliability
I just leave Asus alone all together if it's a common occurrence
Just buy the 650E Steel Legend just miles better quality
I did the same and I hope you are right about that this problem is only happening on the x670 asus boards man I am anxious now about building my system together
t 155 The video t 298 t 298 The point where he says the thing
Yes sure Its in his 7800X3D Video at 4 52 if the link doesnt put you in the correct timing t 292
Both GN Steve and J2C Jay were reporting it
You are correct hwinfo shows a different story I guess that was an overreaction on my part
So where does Open Hardware Monitor sit in that spectrum
This doesn't look definitive to me Especially as it's all on the same brand board
I had a 7950X blow up non X3D
If there was one with an MSI board I would be leaning much more towards a CPU issue Not yet sold on it's in ASUS problem I think Asus has a good chunk of the market so it doesn't surprise me that the first few cases we've seen have mostly been on ASUS Especially on the high end I guess time will tell Thanks
I personally still run an Gigabyte X470 motherboard and I've never had issues with it I'm actually gonna be upgrading to AM5 soon my Mobo is pretty old lol and am probably gonna get the Gigabyte B650 motherboard this time around Just always had a good experience with them
Running with a AsRock B550m Pro4 R5 3600 here since 2020 no issues Very happy with the features of this board for the low price I paid
gigabyte enjoyer here asus qc is just not there plus their rma is a nightmare
Same ffs
My 7800x3d died on a asus primex670eprowifi a few days ago nothing spectacular but cpu was dead mobo fine
True the board should have shut it down
Yep try reading the rest of my comments
I was using bios version somewhere in early March No limit on any voltages just enabled amd expo Did a bios flash to the latest version and no image still on monitor when booting up the pc Motherboard just displays red light and occasionally orange
Happened before bios update While I was waiting new one from warranty I updated bios Probably made the difference
Yes i update bios to v1 18 on 17 March and this fried up on 1 April for temperatures i didn't check it I use this PC since last December everything work fine then this happened to me I already RMA this motherboard and receive it back I think I can't RMA this CPU because I bought it from China and I live in Thailand Sorry for bad English
Take a look at thise pins Non of them are bent It may have been a cpu or voltage failure and just quincident that it's in a simulation location We also don't know if that person bent any pins back before taking that picture Not uncommon specially when they are trying get an RMA for user caused damage and trying to place blame on AMD motherboard manufacture It's even common for people to get denied an RMA and post such a pictures to try and get revenge This one in this topic was for sure caused by bent pins
Even at low energy usage electronics may have sudden unexpected failures Sadly Zen 4 seems to be a little more prone to it It usually isn't a bad idea to turn off devices not in use which might increase their life expectancy I hope this is covered under warranty for you Would have been a very expensive malfunction without you at fault otherwise
You do know hotspots do exist It's not like entire thing melted it was hot spots Hot spots are already higher temperature spots that are normal in any chip
Indium which is often used under the IHS has a melting point of 156 degrees celcius
I've heard hit and miss things about asrock motherboards in general but it seems their AM5 boards are pretty good
I m not aware of any issues with the B650E I except some users experiencing coil whine
The motherboard vendor won't give you a cent unless you can convince them they are at fault Chances are pretty good in THIS case that you will be able to RMA NEITHER Because they will just blame each other ONE of them is liable for BOTH Edit everyone is aware you can just omit facts during the RMA I'm simply pointing out if you tell the vendor the full story they will point out that obviously the marker of the part that failed is liable Vendors might have a different opinion about who is at fault
If it s a custom build why would the mobo manufacturer care about damage done by the CPU
Right but the failure of the motherboard wasn't due to a component of the motherboard this looks like it came from the CPU which RMA wouldn't cover x200B That's like going to the dealership to file a warranty claim because your keys tore a hole in your seat the seat cover didn't fail due to manufacturer defect
You would try get the the cost of the motherboard reimbursed by the CPU vendor not the motherboard
Warranty is for defects from the manufacturer you can't ask them to pay for another company's mistakes Warranty is not insurance if you want stuff like this to be covered you need to pay for it
Mutual sepuku It was a game of chicken and nobody backed down
Could be but for those of us who do board level repair the cause of dead cpu is a mosfet shorting open and hitting the cpu with 12V like 99 99 of the time Much more common on high power gaming laptops than desktop boards though
I worked retail IT for a decade Only a handful of faulty CPUs lots of faulty motherboards This is also not unexpected A CPU is manufactured by a single factory with a single purpose A motherboard is made of thousands of components from many different manufacturers with more interaction from factory machinery
Must be an extremely small chance Havent experienced a CPU dying on its own in like 30 years Usually its a component on the motherboard that dies For the very few CPUs that did end up dying it was 100 user error Currently on my 3rd Ryzen 2 of them are running 24 7
Yup it's just an order of magnitude smaller than all other pc parts Lile 0 1 0 5 and some of those are likely transport user While ram motherboard and gpus can be as high as 10 if you are unlucky with a model
Intel ones die as well I've had several fail during my lifetime and replaced many server processors when I worked for IBM
Just need to point out unless you did some electrical measurement with tools You don't actually know what happened
That s crazy man I bought my 5800X3D when they were pretty hot but I was lucky that Micro Center had stock and of course they had no problem with the exchange New CPU and all good I was using a Crosshair Dark Hero which may have saved my ass I dunno What a board that was I ve since moved to all AM5 no regrets
Were you wearing an ESD wrist strap while working on your PC Electrostatic dischage is thing
Error code on the mobo presumably
that would lead me to suspect a power issue surge a brownout could cause the pc to turn on when the power comes back
You think it would turn itself on
Thermal protection would still kick in At worst it should just shut off if the thermals are out of control
Sir you are wrong about this Correctly apply paste put cpu fan on top take it off again and it will exactly look like that
Thanks For the response I thought I was going nutty looking at the 'll be curious to see their response
On the flip side I've only bought Asus motherboards for about 20 years now and have never had an issue with them with both Intel and AMD CPUs
GN is in the comments and is gonna buy the parts off OP
I'm sorry but ThinkPads are trash these days The last ok one I had was the T450s ever since then I used some combination of Yogas X1 Carbons T14 had a lot of ThinkPads at work and also I was IT support and all had significant failures USB C that was used for charging failed trackpad stopped tracking black screens Funny thing is that I got one their gaming Ideapads for myself because the deal was insane and it worked better than any of the ThinkPads I used previously Not sure why that is but person shrugging
Yea two weeks now
no i didn't touch the actual voltage controls but yes i'm running a negative CO with a bclk overclock
This has only been happening on Asus X670 boards There's a case on an MSI board mentioned in this very comment section
Sooo should I keep my Asus B650E I I ordered last night Nervous about this
Typical asus shit going on 've been warning about this for months with their QA issues everyone seems to blow me off and downvote to bury my comments Bad bios issues electrical problems and now x3d cpus and motherboards imploding each other
We got no choice man as a sff pc haver our choice is this B650e i or MSI B650i which MSI has a tons more issue than asus one
Maybe that causing the issue
I've been burnt by crappy ASUS crappy and bloated software bad support lagging or missing firmware updates and overpriced hardware 20 years ago and have not bought another Asus product since Came close this time because x670E boards were hard to get around here but in the travelled a bit to buy an MSI board There's a couple of bugs right now with MSI boards PBO preferred core and the new 7950x3D lets see and hope they'll fix it in a reasonable amount of time
We sff pc user itx dont have many option only B650i msi which is shit or this asus rog B650e i
I will build my PC tomorrow today just bought all the component man im scared this is my first time build
Is this issue only related if you change one AMD CPU to another Asking cause I'm waiting for new PC parts which include an ASUS TUF MOBO and the 7800X3D I'm only migrating GPU and SSD every other part is brand new Should I format my SSD and install from scratch my current CPU is 9700K
I understand that but that s not what I actually asked
Just use HWiNFO is what I'll
Hwinfo shows a max of 5050 was hit on most of the cores I haven't tried Open Hardware Monitor yet
35 it's a Russian vid but he mention an MSI board that was paired with 7950X3D that also died But I agree most problems are seen with Asus boards
Yeah I just sold an X570 ITX Gigabyte motherboard It was solid Looked good too
but honestly u A321200 we see 1 reddit post now and I bet 1000s using this board and have no problem 90 of the users that go for AM5 will also go for x3D I am confident it's not a big issue and that worst case a bios update is coming out
yes reading this but I still go for the Asus mainboard There would be 1000s dead CPUs if it would be a real problem Not 2 3 cases you got warranty
This
You might be lucky in that the chip could have died but the mobo is ok I would tear it down and have a look
and why didn't you update your bios to the latest version after you see what's going on
Thanks Yea I am coming from a i7 6700k and ASUS Gene VIII which was 24 7 without issue
AM5 AsRock MSI have been top traditions XD
noice
I've had to rma a motherboard about a year ago and they didn't even ask me about it just sent the new one and I sent them the old one
The Motherboard gave the CPU the power to destroy itself
Or OP could ignore this advice and try to RMA it
if this is the fault of the CPU I have a good feeling AMD will cover the cost of the mobo as well this is a rare case and AMD customer service is pretty good
Worst thing he can do is not even try Let em say no
It's insane how many people voted for you for commenting just completely false information clown face
Well you can't know which caused it both have damage but you have no idea what did it so RMA works for both Generally they will give it just because it's rare to have an issue like this related to installation
My MSI motherboard killed two of my Samsung M 2 NVMe drives with its cooling pads preattached under the motherboard shield These pads were such poor quality that they start dripping out liquid and wetting the whole m 2 chip when the system heated up MSI didnt give a shit They said it was likely silicon liquid that couldnt cause short circuits and blamed samsung I hinted them to the fact that it couldnt be healthy for these small plastic parts and metal contacts including the stickers to be wetted dried on a daily basis Still MSI didnt give a shit and they said they need proof for it What I defintely gonna proof them is that my wallet can easily decide for another manufacturer for my next build
Except that's not how RMA works the burden of proof is on manufacturer You don't have to prove anything they have to prove it was your fault and if fault wasn't yours then they have to accept RMA In case that the CPU was at fault then mobo manufacturer may seek compensation from AMD or vice versa but that's besides you at that point
How's life at Newegg
A manufacturer should at least accept an RMA to investigate the issue IMO Cool companies like Yamaha do this even if you've made it clear to them that the item was damaged in a way not covered by warranty
ur talking shit
Literally most rmas they don't even ask you what happened And if they do most of those times they'll trust customers word on an honor code so long as obvious signs of warranty voiding activity isn't present it's not worth their time to care Tech RMAS aren't insurance companies bruv they don't claim accuse liability v
I ve RMA d a motherboard I spilled soda on before I had just finished building my new PC about 5 years ago went down stairs to grab a soda came back up and set it on my desk bent down to pick up my PC and my hat clipped the soda and it tipped onto the top of My Pc freaked out disassembled and cleaned everything however I did not wait long enough for it to dry and when I turned it on I heard a small pop but it stayed on I installed OS and a game and ran the game then I started to smell the clasic ozone smell letting you know you blew a capacitor I shut it down and tried to turn it back on and it never did RMA d the mother board and she s been humming away ever since
In quite a few countries the burden of proof for warranty claims doesn't work this way and its great
Man reading this I'm happy for EU customer rights laws
Unless you bought both from the same retailer
Wrong Those are contact pads and the socket does deliver power It would be very hard for them to prove the motherboard didn t kill the cpu and fry itself
Depending on how long it was Amazon takes motherboards back
You simply don t mention the other not that hard RMA the CPU don t mention the MoBo and vise versa Why would you give them ammo to turn down the RMA
I highly doubt they are going to ask a thing Both parts speak for themselves An RMA will be very easy In this case I m betting
wrong as long there's no bent pins they will accept the rma no problem
That's not how warranty law works It's up to the company to prove they are not at fault It'd asinine if customers had a burden of proof like that pretty much every RMA would be denied if that were the case
Wait it's 100 certain that it wasn't the MOBO that did that to the CPU I mean it could go way around and the CPU guarantee could not apply
Both want to know this happened in case it s their fault It s impossible to know whether it s the CPU or the Mobo without both parties investigating Very possible both AMD and mobo maker talk to each other once the RMAs occur Regardless neither wants this unsolved
I'm confused what you mean by custom Not a pre built I don't think that necessarily matters as long as it isn't negligence which I doubt they think it would be
The board likely caused the damage CPUs don t just explode like that on their own
tbh this is on Asus they should refund both
If inserting my keys to start the car causes a hole to be torn in the car seat then it's 100 manufacturer
't tear a hole in your seat cover from driving normally The fuck Not even close to a comparison nice strawman though
That sounds like you re also saying it could be the motherboard
In the grand scheme of things it is rare though with world wide forums like reddit we hear about lots Compared to the millions of chips they sell having a few that die isn't a big deal
Even in this case we don't know if it was the CPU or board Both are totalled so you'd likely need an electrical engineer to figure it out
I believe any covers Intel The only CPU I've ever had die was an Intel one
Just need to point out that it's irrelevant what happened it's dead as fuck Do i wish i know for sure what happened Of course I wouldn't and you either know what to measure anyways It stopped working i never mishandled it and i've built plenty of computers over the years the likelihood of being barefoot on wood floors living in a humid state and having ESD kill it is super duper low to a point of absurdity that's probably as much as i need to mention
i had a skylake cpu mobo combo that would do that randomly when it was off as long as the PSU switch wasn't off It does happen lol
Maybe the thermal protection failed
Oh absolutely I'm just saying OP can't be certain it was actually idle
I'll have to disagree Their support has been amazing for the issue I had My E series had a BIOS update go bad and they replaced the main board 1 year out of warranty and they came to my house to pick it up and drop it off for the repair For work I needed a laptop with ECC memory and Lenovo Canada made a one off SKU for us to meet our needs For Asus when the fan went back in my G14 they refused to believe me and made me run the diagnosis that said it was fine and after that they wanted me to mail it to their repair depot 100s of KM away with zero promises they would fix it under warranty
I d just get benchmarks running constantly and try to kill it off sooner than later tbh
Well tbf this could be an overreacted isolated case like when the 3090s released which affected less than a percent of users
I would still go MSI over ASUS tbf but hey it's your money
I have the MSI It's ok but I wish I'd gone for the Gigabyte kf kf or Asrock 20PG ITX 20WiFi 20PG ITX 20WiFi ITX motherboards for the faster boot times The MSI was the cheapest by about CAD30 50 I didn't think to research the differences Having said that it's only an extra 25 40 secs LOL
Those are not the only 2 AM5 mITX motherboards Even if they were you in fact do have a choice
I don't see how that would kill a cpu
kf v jDNssmyWcKg
Good luck man keep me updated how it went for you
I'm no expert here Treat this info as you want With what im hearing or im down as big as 35 in some games 1080p You will never be able to tell probably For own sanity and potential risk
Thank you
But it's one problem too many I have yet to come across anything on any forum similar with AM5 CPU mobo combos other than the X3D plus Asus motherboard Or even anything similar on Intel AM4 platforms
I did a late inning switch to the ASUS 650E E Good enough for what I need
To be fair to OP alot of people probably dont follow this sort of thing to closely They build their systems and just use them Makes you wonder how many other unsuspecting victims there are
I really dnt keep up with the news I go home play games sleep work and repeat I would ve updated my bios to the latest or turned of amd expo if I d known to save me the trouble that im going through with amd warranty claim atm
Most people trust CPU vendors and Motherboard Vendors to not sell equipment that will melt out of the box if you arent chasing the latest bios 99 of people never update their bios and dont have their CPU MOBO
First of all that is from 14 years ago did you even read any of it The ones in that article where caused by overlooking and feeding to much voltage to the CPU by choice Second of all those bent pins look entirely different more burnt than bent then the bent pins the OP has pictured His where caused by something brushing over them This was not caused by over voltage or a CPU failure Over voltage will not bend pins in all the same direction
Yep I'm not considering ASUS anymore Completely written them off Leaning towards Gigabyte or MSI but to get comparable features it is at least 50 100
Only the 670 not seen one report of the 650 causing issues
Yeah not sure where that poster is from to think that they wouldn't get warranty for
It was like that when it arrived is the only answer if anyone ever asks anyways If you try and explain what happened you'll just confuse the below minimum wage call center employee who may escalate it to someone who cares enough to defend their corporate wallet
I can already hear the mobo guy The CPU used the
Simple concise and funny
Just like governments to there people
Imagine telling them that lmao
guns dont kill people bullets do
This is the correct answer If a product is capable of physically damaging another product due to a hardware defect they're going to want to know take care of any instances where that happens I work in technical support for another tech company and if this happened to them they would usually send the customer a new one and request that the customer send them the damaged hardware
Why don't you explain why the motherboard vendor would give you money if you destroy the board with a defect part
yeah i mean it could be the mobo that killed the CPU too
Yes they will definitely investigate and talk to the other company Definitely won't be a case of a minimum wage warehouse employee giving it a once over to see if they can get away with refusing your RMA
In my limited experience hardware companies definitely talk to each other about failures when there's a reason to do so A lot of the time it's them blaming each other but they do talk
Mobo manufacturer will blame the CPU or the user's installation of it AMD will blame the mobo manufacturer or the user's installation Neither will refund or replace
Basically do the lawyer thing sue everyone and their mother let them figure out who fucked up Edit I m not actually saying to sue suing everyone and letting them figure it out is like making an RMA claim to everyone and letting them figure out who is at fault
The Threadstarter should give AMD and the Mainboard manufacture the RMA numbers so they have a connection
Dealt with ASUS RMA before They re awful This is going to be a classic finger pointing game ASUS going to blame user or AMD AMD going to blame ASUS or the user IF that s a BIG if this gets resolved then it s going to take a long time
99 of time if they see physical damage they will blame the customer
The board supplied the CPU with the power the PSU supplied the board the house supplied the PSU the grid supplied the house the energy company supplied the house Big oil strikes again
I originally read it as AMD My apologies
You actually can tell where the failure is with a multimeter schematics and EE knowledge I literally just did it with a friend's mobo It's not irrelevant especially when you make statements like you know it was the CPU when you actually don't
Well it appears Gamers Nexus is going to buy the board so maybe we'll see something about it in the future
No I agree ThinkPads have better support and ASUS is trash I'm just saying their laptops aren't as well built as they are used to
Asus one also not so bad but yeah msi is a bit lag
I like MSI for Intel and Gigabyte for AMD
i personally got the strix because it has pcie5 nvme and pcie5 x16 all other itx b650 boards had one or the other it's been a great board after bios updates
Well i guess that gigabyte dont come here in malaysia
You too
Yeah I'll do BIOS update to latest non beta no memory overclock using EXPO clean install Until there is some info from ASUS AMD or GamersNexus on the issue
That's still not really meaningful since these things can just take one thing that has same odds as being hit by lightning and all of a sudden it's I heard of it one time never do that despite how rare or much of a freak accident situation it really is
yeah there are unfortunately not many of these 650 Asus boards available in my country Most are 670 it is what it is I hope I got a good board I have mine now and waiting for the CPU to arrive What bothers me most is the return window of 7 days haha I can't make that for sure
I saw the LTT video on how awesome this 7800X3D chip was and I was planning my first build in 9 years Before I pulled the trigger i was researching the best motherboards to use with it and randomly came across the gamersnexus video about the melting CPU I got extremely lucky I have never built a AMD PC before and I am honestly considering taking the price hit for a intel that has never had a failure this catastrophic in my lifetime
History can repeat itself
They're from corporate
Why would the motherboard company refund or replace a product that was damaged by something else
lmao i have no idea where your ordering from we have consumer protection laws here
Their
That's litterly what they do many motherboards run cpus out of spec so they can advertise they run better on their motherboard
Actually that's far more likely Mosfets take 12V and only switch on 1 12 of the time to produce 1V for the cpu When those mosfets get stuck on the cpu gets hit with 12V That's how cpus die 99 9 of the time
I ve worked for a number of tech and product companies and RMAs usually do result in investigation to at least some degree Especially cases like this where there s a potential risk to products Since most RMAs start with a CS ticket usually the way it works is that the CS lead manager will flag it to a product person if there s any concern of it being more than a one off event CS teams are measured on primarily on contact resolution but if they don t flag something like this that could be a major product risk it s definitely not acceptable At least where I sit in the industry I can tell you that I talk regularly to folks at HW and various platform companies and I ve had colleagues flag things to me in various roles when they thought we should know something is broken Depends on the company but I know from working with AMD that they re usually pretty connected with all their partners I work for one of AMD s many partners now
Exactly this Their QA deparment in fucking Korea or China probably would like to take a look at that Billy Bob who unwraps fraudulent RMAs filled with river rocks for 12 USD Hr doesn't give a fuck nor does he know who to call to report something like this
have you ever worked a job higher than cash register or cook at a fast food restaurant lol
Always better to try The only definite no is when you don t at least attempt it
Waste of money Lawsuits are expensive
Why would you sue their mother Dorothy Mantooth is a SAINT
Yes I have and my RMA went fine It was pretty blandly simple stuff I sent the product in after getting a replacement with a box It s definitely possible it turns into finger pointing Or maybe not I ve seen both happen and the worst case is that you at least get a shot at a replacement
Hi is this the power plant at Niagara Falls So I've got a computer and was referred to
No worries
Sure come do it for me all i know is it's dead and you're in here saying you don't actually know how it died I don't but what i do know is that it's dead So honestly i wish you'd stop replying What purpose do you serve in being annoying I edited my post just for you
Great username I get it but have no use for it Nvme is going to be expensive and a decent pcie 4 0 will be enough for direct storage for gaming Gpus can t make use of gen 4 speeds Then there s only expansion cards left that I wouldn t use on itx anyway It s future proof but I don t see next gen gpus improving that much to need the bandwidth
I can t find it in Germany either We will need some more patience while waiting
I still wouldn t rule it out The problem is extremely rare and quite easily negated Ive got no regrets buying one
Hahahah 3
Because it's quite possible that the motherboard was the cause It's the motherboard that supplies power to the CPU not the other way around If the user wasn't overclocking and manually fiddling with voltages then it's absolutely a failure caused by incorrect power delivery which is controlled via the BIOS Things like this don't happen while the system isn't under load and is just idling unless there's some sort of power delivery issue
Not exactly something else it is something that is supposed to go there good luck using a motherboard without a CPU installed The damage occurred presumably under normal usage it wasn't caused by the user
Because people don't go around punching their motherboards like they do with peripherals so there's little incentive to assume user malice or even that it was damaged by something else This could've well been caused by the motherboard and the manufacturer will want to figure it out before they have hundreds of these and have to do a general recall Sending this motherboard to R D is much more valuable to them than the price of one single board and they can't do that if they deny your claim and send it back tl dr preventing X company motherboards explode your CPU the 200 300 for a board
The logic IS right I can tell you from both sides the company isn't normally going to pay to replace something if it's possible an outside component caused the damage Even if it's not the board's fault the company will just replace it given the profit margins and the ROI of just keeping the customer happy even if they know it's a bullshit claim technically The labor hours to investigate the claim is far more expensive than a shipping label and a customer being left hanging for days on end Plus you don't want to hold up the process only to discover it IS your product at fault It's all about ratios and depending on the industry they might process the RMA and then file paperwork with AMD after the fact for credit etc
There's a lot of value in having a happy customer If the motherboard is damaged in any way that could maybe be their fault they're not going to bother pointing the finger at the CPU They'll reject obviously bullshit claims like if your brother decided he wanted to work on his karate kicks and the only board he had nearby was your motherboard but something like 's no obvious evidence of misuse you're good
Have you been burned before
Yea I know some motherboards for the 5000 series just have limits disabled from factory if I remember correctly
wasnt it der8auer that had a dead cpu from a mobo or from a viewer of him so possible edit them breaking one X3D during WC tests because the bios didnt limit Vcore v FVkTGq7brP4 t 1734s viewers cpu delidding itself possible mobo fault v 34VbutE Qss
Exactly I am in the field and something like this would see returns to both vendors for investigation neither would balk Except Intel they always balk then begrudgingly accept
how did the vapor chambers slip quality control I mean figured during testing they get marked and sent to someone to investigate if it was a one off Then when it can be reproduced fairly
I ve worked for a number of tech and product companies and RMAs usually do result in investigation to at least some degree Especially cases like this where there s a potential risk to products We are talking about a company which when first encountered 7900XTX reference overheating throttling rejected all RMAs and played a dead body and only started doing something when it became a widespread issue Unless they learned their lesson the expectations of them to investigate and solve this should be low My expectations here is just as others suggested both parties will start blaming each other and no one will admit fault If that happens i suggest OP to send the both parts to some major HW outlet so they can take it apart and inspect it Make it a public case of negligence
Yes I run a very large department
No I wasn t saying to sue but that making an RMA on everyone and letting them figure it out is like lawyers suing everyone and letting them figure out who is at fault
Maybe Did your motherboard have burn marks on pins like that though I just did a RMA with AMD for a 7700X Seems their RMA team is either A understaffed B overwhelmed or C Both A B Several days to respond to inquiries Simply ignoring inquiries Losing them blaming USPS for not delivering my package and then miraculously finding it after I start asking questions Between my experience with ASUS and AMD in the last year I wouldn t count on either one being replaced
ASUS does advanced RMA for products That s not how any RMA with them I ve ever had to do has been handled Last January as it has been in the past required the motherboard to be sent in for inspection
no one has a use for it yea the difference between gen3 and gen4 gpu's is like 1 2 but im a once every 8 10 year builder with maybe a gpu or two upgraded along the way for me it makes sense to future proof
I already bought B650e i just now Hope its fine Atleast im not buying 670 board
My concern is the quality control to cause this it seems very glaring I ll sit for a month and see what changes in the news
I had a similar experience AM4 really did bring the value
I did the same from a 2700 to a 5800x3d Awesome
i also went from 1400 to 5600 on an A320 board too
I went from R3 1200 to R5 5600x on MSI B450 Tomahawk Max I was impressed with the performance boost
I am happy too went from 1600x to 5900x but lets not forget that amd only decided to support 5000 cpus on older mobos because of intel starting to be competitive
A little story I've just decided to upgrade to AIO from air cooler for my r9 5900X since I got tired of my computer turning into a jet taking off whenever the Temps spiked As it would seem my backplate on my motherboard went missing the air cooler used something else I could not find it anywhere and couldn't find a good place to order from where the delivery wouldn't take like 2 weeks My previous pc had a r7 1700 For whatever reason i thought it was AM3 but it's AM4 so after 2 days of that stupid piece of metal being a bane of my existence I remembered and took it out from old pc and just swapped the coolers for the air one from my current one Tl dr The longevity of am4 platform saved me a lot of stress finding a replacement backplate Thank you AMD
5800X3D best CPU price performancewise available So happy to got it replaced a 3900XT
I bought in on X370 in 2017 specifically on the promise of support through 2020 people seem to have some rose tinted glasses about AM4 longevity There was even questions over whether we'd get the 3000 series on those initial slides fed all sorts of lines about it wasn't possible BIOS limitations then oh look we can totally do it I upgraded from a 1700X to a 3700X in November 2021 because it seemed like we were never going to get the promised support then two months later they allow the processors in X370 boards I wasn't about to shell out and reward them with another sale I'm not buying into Intel this current 13th generation I've been stuck on dead end platforms before but I'm not buying in on first Gen AM5 boards either that's a lesson learned
Maybe it time to swap my r5 2600 for 5800x3d grinning face with sweat
Yep did the same 1500x to 5600 and I think 5800x3d is next
I'm kinda pissed this is the end of the line for my 370x upgrade path to 5000 series I finally sucked it up and bought a b550 and upgraded to a 5700x They were deleting Beta BIOS's making excuses so I thought it was official and I grumbled and moved on And this is with a flagship 370x I was here with my 370x and a 1700 paying to fucking beta test their platform from day one of release and this is how you treat us x200B Then around christmas this past year my gaming buddies were like I want to upgrade what should I buy I just double check CPU compatibility on their x200B Happy for them pissed at how this was all handled
BuT It DOeS NoT mAttEr iN tHe LonG RUn S Said all the AMD haters a while back when the DOA intel platform was released It's just amazing to be able to upgrade on a platform of 4 years i went from 1600x to 3600 to 5700x and all bought when cpu's where cheap
Huge upgrade Congrats
That's a good upgrade at a good price to and you can recoup some money back with the sale of the 1600x
Nice even bigger upgrade than me who went from 2600 to 5600
Yup That's why im just chilling waiting for am5 to fully mature and come down in pricing Then probably pay a b650 mobo for around 100 eu and drop a last gen cpu in it skipping the 7000 serie altogether i have a 5800x and it's well enough for what i do for another 3 4 years
I jumped the gun and bought an x570 because I originally thought that b450 wouldnt support Zen 3 and then it did haha Went from 2600x to 5900x Happy with it but yeah probably a couple hundred dollars that I didn't need to spend
Wiping my tears with Trx40 I'll never not be salty about these
2600 to 5800x on a b450 motherboard AM4 longevity is the best indeed
Did the same thing from a 2600 to a 5700X D
Yeah AM4 is the reason its hard to go to AMD5 I went from 1800X on a X370 to 5900X Which means they've earned my future purchases on new PC Builds and now video cards Though I wish they'd build better drivers But as any mega corp I await for them to piss me off due to profits
I got the 3700x It is worth upgrading to the 5800x3D thinking face
That's a really nice upgrade I recently upgraded my 2600X to a 5800X3D too AM4 ftw
Meanwhile people upgrading from 3600 to 3600x because performance
am upgrading rn from a 2600 to a 5700x as well i was literally about to set aside extra money for a board upgrade when my friend mentioned that my b450m is still compatible just needs a bios update love the savings i got
I went 1200 to 5600 I'm happy and i hope in 4k 5600 doesn't bottleneck rtx 4070 ti
i have ryzen 1600 and b350 motherb i want at least 5600
Went from a 2700x to a 5800x on a crosshair vi x370 single core uplift is insane
Wait You can upgrade to Zen 3 on 300 series motherboards How do you upgrade the BIOS for that Not that I'd do that now as I'm not gaming much atm but I might upgrade in the future from my 1600X to a 5800X3D if I get back gaming
Incredible how this sub is so good at praising longevity of AM4 and at the very same time hateful towards AM5
Slot 1 was longest supported platform on intel too
I had a 1600 and went to a 13700k I just realized which sub I'm in so I feel like I should mention I got a 7900 xtx for a gpu
Do any one know what the best processor to get on MSI gaming pro Carbon B350 I'm a little confused on what you can get and what not
Huh I thought I was tripping for a second The shadow on the right side made the heat spreader look to be made of cloth or something with your fingers squishing it
Thinking to do the same thing How is the performance difference
I went 1600x 3600x now 5600x Still happy with it
At some point I intend to upgrade from a r7 5700g to an r9 5950x Am4 is funny
I did the same 5600 from 1600
Went from 1600 to 5900X My PC is flying now
B450m mortar max and 2600 2600x 2700x 5800x Investing in a motherboard with good VRM really paid off
Currently on X370 Prime Pro Went from 1600AF used 3600X used 5600 new 5800X new Great platform
That is one of the reasons I switched back from Intel They do a socket for basically every CPU family Meanwhile my current build started with a 3800x and is now on a 5800x
This is the way
Nice I too have a 1600x and wanna get an upgrade when I can Nice to know this is possible
Went to 5600x from 1600x last month 1 motherboard that'll probably last me a decade is awesome
1600 to 5800X love to see it
When from a 1400 to a 5600x on a msi b350 gaming pro with last year bios Patience game A month ago I switched from the NV 1060 to a radeon 6800xt to complete the change
Went from 2700x and 5800x and not having to upgrade motherboard was a huge bonus
It's a great deal for one motherboard fitting 3 generation path of cpu Btw I just did a upgrade to 5700x too from my legacy am 3 8300 gif emote free emotes pack joy It's an immersion experience too
I went from an Athlon 3000G to a Ryzen 7 5700G in my little Asrock Deskmini and the performance difference was kind of ridiculous Kept everything else the same That said I really appreciated the upgrade path of AM4
That 1600x has seen some shit
Malaysia represent
I was stupid then for going for intel platform for this reason
Not as big of a jump but I went from a 1700x to a 3900x This little 3900x still impresses me I don't game much and I don't get to work from home often anymore When I do though it's instantly apparent how powerful this thing is I just absolutely love it
went from a 1600AF to a 5700X too cost me 198 and Uncharted Dead Island 2 came free with it
2600 to 5700x a weeks back here thumbs up enjoy
I bought Ryzen 1700 B350 Tomahawk on release day in April 2017 My path was 1700 2600 3600 5800x3 Gains are incredible
Hell of a jump Enjoy
About to do the same 1600 5700x on an x370 Taichi Fingers crossed I don't fuck up the BIOS flash
I just this week also went from a 1600 to a 5700x as well Pretty incredible the old b350 boards can do that and hopefully get me another 4ish years from here PSU is probably next on the list
Yeah am4 was a great choice went from 2600 to 5600x on b450
I'm still on my 2600x just upgrades my GPU to a RX 6750 XT and added ram and a M 2 SSD Upgrading the cpu will be the next step if I run into issues although I'm running most games on ultra at 1440p60 now
Went from 1600AF to 5600 now waiting on AM6 or Intel in few years I guess Great deal
Let's hope am5 will have the same longevity Somehow it doubt it
went from a 1500x to a 2600 to a 3600 to a 5800x
Just did the 1600 to 5800x3d upgrade and can't believe the difference
i'm currently on 2600 and thinking about an upgrade 5600 5700 and 5800 are on the list are additional cores worth it if you're not content creator for light gaming etc
I have a b450 tomahawk and I m upgrading from a 3600 to 5800x3D
you should have gone for a 5800x3D that would have blew your mind even more But maybe the 5700x is more ok for earlier era power delivery motherboards Albeit I know a madman with an Asrock A320M using a 5950x with no particular issues
Ehh I wish My Aorus b450 board was just bad sadly It couldn't take certain ram and there was this horrible usb bug Now with my b550m steel series it got better and I got more performance from my 3700x
Went from a 1600 to a 5800x crazy how much of an improvement you can get on the same mobo
I went from R5 2600x to R7 5700X 4 months ago truthfully 5700x is overkill for me probably i should have gone for the R5 5600X but the price difference was 40euro at that time
It's funny how the lighting makes the top CPU look crumpled lol
cries in 3950x
I just upgraded from 3000 to 5000 series too effortless Quick bios update and pop it in it was great
2600x on release day and 5600x last year Good shit
How did it work when they're not the same size
I had a decent jump when I went from a 2600 to a 3700x a couple years ago I had to change out everything though motherboard ram GPU because my 2600 was a core i7 from around 2012
I ve got a 3600 X trying to figure out what to upgrade to There s a Rison seven available at a exchange place nearby for 330 pounds
the motherboard manufacturers probably aren't happy about it because they can't sell you another one
Same but from R3 1300x to R7 3700X using the same MSI B350 mortar arctic
I made the same jump Amazing how cost efficient it was
I just went from 1600 to 5500 on a B350M
I went from 1700x to 5950x such a massive boost I'm the same mobo
Recently upgraded from a Ryzen 1700 to a 5700 all while using my original x370 Crosshairs Hero 6 Unbelievable upgrade path and so glad I bought into it
The 5700X is an amazing CPU at an amazing price It is the best bang for the buck on AM4 platform
but the 1600x looks so much bigger
I went from a 1200 on an a320 to a 3600 then when I built my 6900xt rig i went for a b550 5600x combo and now have my old pc with 3600 on a320 and a 5700xt that im gonna give to my older brother Am4 made it so simple
Looking forward to upgrading my 2600 sometime
R5 1400 to R7 5800x3D on the MSI Bazooka B350m here Absolute night and day difference
Me decided I want the 5700x to replace my 3700x But seeing temptation everywhere with the 5800x3D In reality I was decided for the 5700x because i want to keep a low tdp CPU to keep my machine silent But that x3D just keep showing up showing improvements everywhere But then comes the price 207 to 388 I can't possibly justify that
Same but 2700X to 5600 still b350 had a 1700X to start Mild to insane performance uplift depending on the task even much faster on desktop It took some backpeddling and wait time to get the older AM4 boards updated fully but at least they came around and did it and now I can enjoy a fresh CPU and new features like SAM on an old machine
That's one hell of an upgrade AM4 really was and still is the bee's knees
5 years longevity for a socket is awesome it pretty much fits one 5 year upgrade cycle for most people
1600 to 5600 for me Very pleased
I think we can expect the same from am5
Would a 5800x3D be worth it over a 5800x with my 4090
This is really insane when you think about it On Intel that would be 2 3 motherboards at this point I am in 5600x and still waiting to upgrade to 5800x3d probably sometime next year if it will be cheap enough
Just bought a 5600x to upgrade from a 1600 for a server Should be nice
I upgrade so rarely that even AMD socket longevity wouldn't mean anything to me but for those who do it's always nice to save 100 bucks
I went from 1500X in 2017 to 3600 in 2019 to 5800X3D in 2023 on a B350 Tomahawk I have never used a single motherboard with so many generations of chips I now plan to keep this system until at least 2027 by which time the board itself will be 10 years old It s mind boggling
Looks like the skin of the 1600x is off
I went from 3600 to 5700x I ideally wanted to go 5800x3d but for 210 CAD I had to go with the 5700x
to the perennial whats the cheapest gamer i can switch from a console to a basic intel as an answer is superficial The correct question ought add has an upgrade path Am4 is a deceptive bargain A 120 5600 cpu a sub 100 mobo may be a smidge slower dearer to some intel 4 core stock clearance but am4 tho last gen still has an awesome upgrade path Its a far better big picture proposition
I needed to build a new PC I went with the 5900X Came from an i7 980X so it was definitely time I'm actually considering switching to the new series so I can upgrade like this but I'd have to find a buyer for my current stuff
They're doing IC packaging in Malaysia now
am5 mobos expensive Well doh Its a much classier mobo AM5 has 24 pcie5 lanes intel have 16 for starters
1600x to 5800x3D perfect value
I went from Ryzen 5 2600 to Ryzen 7 5800X Great job keeping the same socket
I had quite a journey myself Got a 1300x sold it for just a slight loss to get a 2600x Again slight loss to a 3600 Just wanted to try it out A friend wanted a cheaper PC start so I sold him the 3600 and got the 5600x Gonna stay put for a while
I also went from my 1600 to a 5700x on my Strix b450
Yep love the longevity of AM4 Didn't need to upgrade but I figured what the heck Asus Prime B350 plus Went from 1600x but had issues running 2x8 gb 3200mhz CL14 stable mem controller on the CPU didn't quite get along Updated to a 3700x and the memory was super stable Just updated again to a 5700x and found a good price on 4X8gb 3600mhz CL16 16 16 Figured it was worth a shot although I knew it was a gamble if it would post be stable at XMP Happily it is running like a champ Found it interesting how CPU dependant memory support actually is Also helps that apparently my B350 is T topology so it's better for 4 sticks than although it's my work gaming rig so stability wins over a slight bump
I started with a 1600x and went to a 3900x figuring that it would be the last gen that would work on my x370 Nope Could have went 5x00
Hopefully the same happens with am5
Same went from 1600X to 3600 to 5600X
Went from a 1600 to a 3700x 100 on a320 D
2700X to 5800x here And back in the AM2 days I remember doing Athlon 64 x2 to Phenom II X4 I've always appreciated that about AMD
I went from a 1700X to a 3700X
What makes AMD so special Wish they could have stuck with AM4 I think it was a mistake to move to the new socket at this particular time but I guess to compete against Intel it had to be
Can a MSI Tomahawk 350 go from a 1600x to a 5600 Would I be able to update bios and then just pop in a 5600 afterwards Does it support both chips at the same time
I've gone from the FX8350 go to an r5 5700x too
I'm still using 2600X Wonder if I should upgrade I really dont want to spend more money on a new motherboard ddr5 etc
I'm on an 5800x and I don't plan to upgrade for awhile I wonder if just getting the 5800x3d in 2 years will be an ok upgrade I don't need top of the line just enough to get me by
What board do you have B550
Recently went from 1700x to 5600x
This is why I go amd and I recommend amd They stick with it
Yeah I went from a 1600 to a 3600 to a 3700x and now a 5700x very happy with this platform
Went from a Ryzen 5 2600 to a Ryzen 7 3950 It was then I realised I had not updated my bios since first getting the mobo Now updated it can support newer CPUs Longevity for the win
I went from a 1600 to a 5600x myself And I agree Longevity of platform is HUGE I ain't got the money to upgrade every few years So a jump in performance after 5 to get a few more years out of my system is terrific Only down side is I can't seem to track down a stupid cheap older am4 motherboard to put my 1600 to use as a home server
What mobo you use Ive been wanting to upgrade my 1600x but i have a stryx gaming b350 mobo
This is why I have chosen AM4
Is it possible to upgrade from a 3800x to whatever is currently new For reference I have a 3080ti 16gbs of ram Or is it not that really much of an upgrade
While a convenience you won't be able to take advantage of really useful advantages like the CPUs direct access to gpu memory etc Do upgrade the mobo too when possible so you get the most of that R7
I went from a 2K to a 3K and updated the BIOS which were supposed to work but didn't oh well I got a new board
I hope am5 will be long too
When did they make a 5700 I wanted to go dual 5700s on release wth
I just upgraded to a ryzen 9 5900X too practically plug and play on the AM4
But it doesn t fit
I have a bunch of a320 boards and a b450 that all support 5xxx Ryzens after a BIOS update It's awesome
So thankful my friend convinced me to get an x570 mobo when I had no idea what I was doing Then when I figured things out I upgraded from a 3600x to a 3900xt
Seriously I got the 1600 when it first came out so glad I went with AMD
Allow me to introduce you to my 2200g to 5950x upgrade lmao
1800x 3800x 5800x3d have box not installed yet all on same motherboard 1800x was amazing when your doing multiple vms but single threaded performance was not very good 3800x fixed all that apart from 2x4 core ccd design
I jost got rid of my AMD phenom x6 from 2008 still ran fine I just got a killer deal on a new pc and it needed a new power supply and a new hard drive That cpu was a monster when it was new and was still faster than many modern cheap best buy computers
I love intel but I wish it was like this
Just got a 7600x but my ultimate target will be the 9900x3d
1600af to 5700x all the games that had a bottleneck with my 1660 super now run great crazy efficiency too
1700 to the 5600G AMD knocked it out of the park with AM4 Hope they find a breakthrough like this in graphics
I did the same thing with a 3600 in between
Just did a new B650 build with a 7600x after my old 3570k desktop Hope in a few years I will be able to drop in something like a 9900x3d p
Damn I am still on 1700 from relase you just made me think
Was there a noticeable improvement between the two I have a 1600 and am considering an upgrade
I can only hope that AM5 will last as long
And I'm on TR4
That is a really nice upgrade path
Cries In xeon plebian
Fuck ya man did the same
Why Intel can keep the same socket as AMD I think they do it on purpose to make everybody to buy a new mother
Beast of an upgrade tbh My AM4 journey was 3400G 1600AF 5600X 5900X 5800X3D Now I'm at the end game and will probably upgrade to AM5 in 2024
Same i got an x470 prime asus board went from a 1700x to a 5900x recently
yeah now find PBO and create new post after you find best settings asking for a friend D
AM4 will forever be remembered as the Golden Age of AMD We are truly living through blessed times
gonna do a 1600 to 3700 my mobo cant go any further and thats okay i need to save anywho my 1600s just at the end of its i can do games without much issues
I wonder if the prime minister of Malaysia handcrafted that 5700
Did the same from a 1700 to a 5800x Night and day difference love amd I was glad I supported amd in early ryzen
Nice I jumped from a 1600AF to a 5600 and I'm happy
Just finished my all AMD build with a 7700x partially for this reason Happy so far
AM4 Is such an awesome plataform I bought my Asus A320M K around 2018 i think I wasn't expecting too much longevity for a cheap motherboard I started with a Ryzen 3 1200 Then i upgraded to a 5 2600 And now i have a R5 5600X and all i had to do is update my BIOS
Does anyone know for sure that if I went from a 3700x with a 3070 to a 5800x3d if I would get better gaming performance or are they already too good of a match
Yeah it's a generation for the ages I went from a 2600 to a 5900X I would recommend AM4 to anyone looking to get their money's worth
made in malaysia
I've been thinking about this I've got a 1600x cooled by a Corsair H100 AIO Would I just need to ensure my board can run the 5700X with a BIOS update and then it's a straight CPU swap
And it does give you a jump in performance that you can really feel when using gaming I wish AMD will keep it up with AM5 socket
Exactly what I did Went from a 1600AF to 3600 now rocking a 5700X
Now try 5800X3D
Upgraded my buddy from a 1600 AF to a 135 dollar 5600 He's been eating WELL in value lol Zen Zen3 is at least a 50 uplift per core He only has a 2060 but he plays a lot of older games and stuff like Hearts of Iron so he's usually CPU bound Plus getting him to near the best of AM4 when prices are cheap
1600 to 5800x3d here pretty awesome platform
I'm an AMD ATI fanboy for many years BUT If only the drivers would work I'm tired of the crashes that they don't fix
If I have an ASUS b450 with an amd 4 slot and currently running a Ryzen 7 3700 with a 2060 super will I be able to upgrade to a 5800x3d Been trying to find an answer and this seems like the place to ask
I buyed an AM4 motherboard one year ago for the same reason I expected that we will have AM4 with new zen CPUs compatible with AM4 motherboards or at least Zen 2 compatible with AM here we
after half a decade with intel nvidea i finally build an AMD build finished it earlier this week and lemme tel ya i absolutely understand the hype now
If am5 lasts just as long amd will have a winner on their hands Let s just hope they didn t try any backpedaling shady stuff like they did trying not to support zen 3 on older mobos
Hi guys Can I buy a 2200g or 2400g pc and swap out the chip for a 3600x or add a good graphics card to a 2400g
I switched from Intel for this reason I just got a 7600x as my first aMD card Hoping the AM5 will last as long or more Funny fact I'm pairing this with a Intel arc face with tears of joy
Hoping am5 lasts just as long
Switched from 1700 on a B450 to 5800X More than twice the performance A later switch to an AsRock X570 Steel Legend brought another 8 plus values via 3DMark
This gives me vibes of my AM 6 dual processor system It was a good server in its day
so im getting the ryzen 7 5700 as well i currently have a ryzen 5 1600 and an asrock 450b mother board i was thinking of getting a 550msi with the amd ryzen 7 is this a good idea im on a 290709 gigabyte oc
I truly loved AM4 started with an 1800x upgraded to a 3700x and just recently bought my 5800x 3D great upgrades over the years and it's insane that this performance can come out of the same motherboard I've had for years Always will be team red
seriously I need these got the Ryzen 5 3600 but i need these 7
AMD kept their promise no doubt about that May AM5 do the same
yeah I went from the 1600x to the 5600x a month later I upgrade the mobo for my gen 4 drive and gpu
Yes
When upgrading from a r5 3600 to r7 5700x my computer shop told me that doing a bios upgrade for my b450 bought in 2020 is risky because it would cause irreversible damage and I wouldnt use the mainboard anymore So they ended up persuading me to buy a new one Is it right that it can cause damage and they just tricked me into believing that
I have an X370 killer board and a 1600x I was looking at this very same upgrade I know I ll probably have to flash my bios a few times to upgrade but I m glad to see someone else has done something similar
I have an ASRock X370 board and a 1600x right now I was looking at this very upgrade u Kattnos how much better is the performance
I have an ASRock X370 board and a 1600x right now I was looking at this very upgrade u Kattnos how much better is the performance
Is there any point upgrading from a Ruben 7 1700X I ve been running it since 2018 and don t see any performance issues paired with my Gtx 1070ti aside from dips in Hogwarts legacy but that game seems to just swallow ram and nothing else
Upgraded from my 1400 to the 5600x with the same motherboard I am indeed happy
SAME 2600x to a 5800x3d made me cry a little bit someone game me my 2600x with a 1060 6gb traded my 2 core 20gb ddr4 15 inch laptop got a gtx 1080 and a whole alien ware 8700 setup that was risky so i used the good parts like case fans all that and turned it into two pc got an old fx athelon build and made it in to my girl going from ddr3 to a ddr4 ryzen 5600x with my old 1060 that was a
It's still got some shelf life left Not done just yet
It's the reason I chose AMD as well The Intel cpu's are really impressive but with AMD I feel like it's just better in the long run and way more cost effective
A game changer for the poor
I did the 2600x to 5950x Same mobo Love the AM4 flexibility
Yeah same here Brilliant X470 With 1700x Now with x5950 Zero problems
I love my 5800x3D it's a gaming beast
I went 2700x to 5900x and the temps dropped lol
would i need a BIOS update am on a Tomahawk Max b450
Still rocking my 2700X that I bought on release I've been eyeballing the 5800X3D as a replacement
I bought a 5800X3D two weekends ago I figure it will be my last AM4 CPU Really been impressed with my years of AM4
I went from a 3300G to a 5800X the difference is stunning
Exactly my upgrade Felt so good
Since i also have a 2700 and plan on getting the 5800x3D i am wondering how big is the preformance difference between the two And if I can get it with a nocuta nh d15 for 400 500 would it be worth it I am going to upgrade my gpu from a gtx 1080 to a rtx 3060ti and increasing my ram from 16gb to 32gb And i plan to get the 5800x3D may june
It cost the same as my RTX 3070 where I live C
2400g to 5800x
You only need latest bios to support on a320 right
I have a 1600AF on a A320 board too I was happy with a future upgrade to a 3800 or something To find out I can put a 5600 on it D
I plan on going from a 2400g zen1 to a 5600 on a b350 when i find some spare cash
Jesus
The B450 Tomahawks are SO good For a good while whenever someone had the budget for a decent mobo that was a go to recommendation Glad to see it held up
Had the r3 1200 Massive improvement
Me too Went from 1200 to 5600 I was very surprised by the jump in performance Everything feels snappy
Right Pricks got a bit cheeky while they thought they could get away with
We can already see AMD getting cozy They axed AM4 and their GPU pricing model is basically take NVIDIA's scalper level pricing and undercut it by a tiny bit
Historical context for those that weren't around when AMD initially considered limiting Zen 3 to only the X570 users which vast majority of them would of had Zen 2 CPUs rather than Zen Zen and B550 users which there were none at the time because B550 hadn't even launched yet In a surprising announcement AMD last week said they would discontinue support for older chipsets with their upcoming Ryzen 4000 series codenamed Zen 3 In the press deck we received for our most recent Ryzen 3 3100 3300X review AMD included a slide that seemed to indicate that the B350 X370 B450 and X470 chipsets wouldn't support future Ryzen processors It's been clarified since that support for future CPU generations such as the upcoming Ryzen 4000 series would be limited to motherboards donning a 500 series chipset so current X570 boards and upcoming B550 motherboards
Having a new socket every other year is just short term planned obsolescence and it's clearly only good for manufacturers and partners not consumers If AMD could have done it with AM4 they would have obviously But that makes it a great feature to get keep users to on your platform And AMD used it to their advantage I wonder what would take Intel to do the same
Everyone was just confused AMD promised support for AM4 in terms of the physical socket form factor they never promised support for specific chipsets being used At least that's the only broken logic I can think of where anyone would even remotely come to the conclusion of AMD meeting some kind of promise about longevity for AM4
Recommend checking out rew up down time or whatever the function i called in bios Can prevent the fans from trying to take off from temp spikes
What aio did you go with What are the temp under load and full load
I'd say if you're after perf price the 5700x is better In Germany a 5700x costs 184 and a 5800x3d 338 which makes the x3d 54 more expensive I don't know why the 5700x gets overlooked so often It's the best budget upgrade option for AM4 IMO
Made the same switch and it s awesome The performance uplift in certain games for example tarkov was brutal Only small complain is that it can get toasty but I forgive that
Best price performance available I actually think it is one of the worst It costs close to 2X the 5700X price at least in my region It costs as much as a 7700X and a 13600K which are objectively better CPUs The only thing the 5800X3D has in its favor are the cheap and widely available motherboards and no doubt that AMD uses this fact to charge a premium for 5800X3D It is a great CPU But somewhat overhyped I would like to see it costing a lot less than it does
Made the same jump cannot believe how much smoother games are in terms of 1 lows
You aren't kidding Went from a 2600x to it What a difference My computer boots so fast now I can't even get into the bios quick enough Had to try like 5 times before I was finally able to
I have a R9 3900X and im never CPU bound
There actually were a lot of technical issues that needed to be worked through They had to severely cut down many bioses to get Zen3 working on 16MB bios boards Tbh it's baffling how they get shit on when they both reversed their decision and launched and gave support to a CPU 2 years after their original end date Like it's amusing how people on this sub somehow transformed no company is your friend to all companies are equally bad When at the end of the day AMD delivered 50 more than their original promise while Intel killed support every other socket Tbh it makes no sense for AMD to even want to limit upgradability Their margins on CPU's are way higher than their margins on the chipset
absolutely Keep in mind that you will most probably have to update your BIOS to the newest version USING YOUR OLD CPU Updating Bios install new CPU On many boards it won't work otherwise
I went from 2600x to 5600 and it was a big difference
Mhh idk I d invest in AM5 when motherboards come down to good prices 150 180 for high end B650 The performance jump on AM4 from a 5600 won t be big anymore even to a 5800X3D
Yeah there were some challenges for sure I think there actually were either technical limitations or logistical limitations not many people can write bioses so AIB's prioritized newer boards But imo much of this is on your motherboard maker's fault many other X370 and even A320 boards received support decently fast
I watched a friend replace a motherboard to go from an i3 7350K to an i5 9400F because the used i7 6700K 7700K were going for over 300 on eBay back in 2019 2020 when one could have sold a 7700K Z270 and for the same money get a new board with an 9600K 9700K or Ryzen 3700X 3900X He had an expensive Z270 board with that i3 Now he's deciding if he wants to upgrade to an expensive i9 9900 i7 9700 while still stuck on DDR4 2666 because he has a non Z 300 series board or replace the motherboard yet again to replace the CPU with something newer Meanwhile I went from a Ryzen 1600 to a 5600 on a 75 B450m Pro4 board
It doesn't matter because I only upgrade every 7 years
I had a b350 and I was so glad I got a x570 The increase in quality was really noticeable and pci gen 4 support is nice to have The VRM quality on the newer boards is so much better too
since you have rtx 3080 than with 5800x3d 1 For 1080p gaming you will get like 20 50 fps boost depends on game esport games like csgo get most fps boost 2 For 1440p gaiming you will get like 15 30 fps boost 3 For 4k you will get 0 fps boost since 3080 can't handle that
Why would the CPU be a bottleneck at 4K
Same way you upgrade the bios any other
Wait You can upgrade to Zen 3 on 300 series motherboards Yes you can on some Running a 5600X on a X370 board here Asus did release a BIOS for my board just had to download it while the old CPU 3600 was on it update the BIOS and then replace the CPU Before getting the new CPU verify that it is supported by the board BIOS combination
Who's hating on AM5 People only hate overpriced Motherboards
I bought a 75 B450 board that is perfectly fine with my needs I'm only using a fraction of its I O I'm not aware of an AM5 board that costs less than 175 And the lower end AM5 boards don't even have PCIe 5 0
they can't afford AM5
Yes I'm super happy all my ddr4 ram is now obsolete and unlike with intel I have to pay 9x as much for ddr5 replacements in addition to everything else I'm kicking up for
Do any one know what the best processor to get on MSI gaming pro Carbon B350 I'm a little confused on what you can get and what not Depends on how you want to use it x200B Productivity 5900x or 5950x Best gaming performance you will ever have on that platform with okish decent productivity where your only goal is pure gaming and not so much productivity 5800x3d Budget option for decent gaming and decent productivity 5700x is like the 5800x costing less and consuming less Watts Best budget option you could get like you don't want to spend a cent more on a CPU and want the job done 5600 x200B Based on this if you want a budget option without spending much money but still want an 8 core CPU I would recommend you to get the 5700x 8 cores decent gaming and productivity performance for each use you are planning to use at it's currently at 190 dollars or so hell that was the price I got a 3600 a couple of years ago but if your work depends on the CPU get the 5900x or 5950x if you have some bucks extra to spend and you want the best work force possible
The latest BIOS update looks like it supports Vermeer chips That would be 5600 5950 cpus
I had a similar upgrade path but with a 3800X in between
Depends on what you exactly play
you should have gone for a 5800x3D that would have blew your mind even more But maybe the 5700x is more ok for earlier era power delivery motherboards it's almost 100 more the price for like what 13 more performance in 1440p for example x200B Definitely not worth I would rather spend that difference on a better GPU
it is the same AM4 socket
Give youself from 2017 at tap on the shoulder for the right decision then
But then comes the price 207 to 388 I can't possibly justify that I was on the exact same situation lmao getting the 5700x at 199 usd or getting the 5800x3D at 390 almost the 100 of the price for what 15 of performance in 1440p I would consider it if the performance was about 50 or something like that for the money but something between 15 and 20 in the absolute best scenario at 1440p takes me back to earth and makes me realize that I should better be spending those 200 bucks on a better GPU not on the 5800x3D
Well if you already spent that money for a 4090 I'd say that yes it is worth x200B Like a friend says if you have money for the whiskey you can afford the ice
Asus strix b350f only had to do a bios update to get it to work
I never had an AMD CPU fail I guess you are not aware that TSMC makes the ryzen chips and they are the most advanced fab in then world who also makes chips for apple nvidia and INTEL Intel has to rely on TSMC for their more advanced chips because they still can't make anything less than 10nm Pretty stupid comment but I'm sure you'll delete it
Considered it but the price difference was too high to justify it
3d cache is a game changer I'm very curious to see if the 7000x3d's get a similar boost over their non 3d counterparts If so those will be absolute monsters
Is it still a good purchase now comming from a 2700
I love my 3d also Went from a 3600 to 5800x3d on a b450 board great upgrade Wanted to ask u what you're cooling that bad boy with I have my temps controlled but wanted to perhaps change to a cooler with a little less fan noise I'm using an older NH D12s by Noctua It's uses a 120mm fan
I've been considering the 5800x3d as I have an AM4 board with a 3700x ATM or just jump to AM5 and the 7000x3d when released Though with the 3800x3d I'd probably be good for 5 or more years
Fresh thermal paste maybe
You do 5000 serie cpu require an update to run on am4 boards the only one that doesn't it'd be a x570s since those come out already flashed to accomodate the 5000 series cpus
Yup had to do a bios upgrade on my B450 A Pro MB Went from 1700x to 5700x
Yes but it should be easy don't worry Mine thankfully worked on the old bios to allow me to set it all up
I ve been doing the same 5900x for me
Congrats I'm a month into ownership with mine There's not really anything better on AM4 for gaming than it so will definitely be your final upgrade unless you do Prod work Do yourself a favour if you haven't already and look into undervolting it These things get hot and it affects the boost clocks I adjusted mine to 30 via PBO2 Tuner and it runs cooler and boosts for longer Super easy to do as well
I also just upgraded from a 2700 to 5800x3D and I have no regrets at all The difference is pretty stunning depending on what resolution you're playing at and the type of game In Forza horizon 5 for example I saw massive gains around 30 40 fps boost at 1440p with CPU upgrade alone A little less significant in something like ghost recon breakpoint where averages climbed by about 15 I will say that even at 4k the frametimes have been massively improved in basically every game and that alone makes every single game feel smoother For reference both CPUs were paired with a 6800 xt I can also speak to the GPU and ram upgrades as I recently upgrade from a 1080 ti Again massive uplift in both frametimes and averages at both 1440p and 4k I probably see a 40 50 boost on average 16 to 32 gb of ram seemed overkill until I had it and I've never looked back from 30 Firefox tabs open in the background of a game lol I typically use 16gb with a browser an intensive game and discord open As for your question about pricing with a nh d15 included you could get that combo for 450 brand new or just under obviously with closer to 400 being a pretty great deal The price of the CPU is solidly worth it right now at 320 340 imo as long as you already have an AM4 board you want to keep using
You're going to get a jump performance jump Ryzen 1000 and 2000 didn't have good performance in gaming tbh it was just good value 5800x3D is beast
If you re upgrading other components as well it would probably be better to get a better gpu think 3080 3070ti or 6800xt and get a 5600x You could always still upgrade to a 5800x3d down the line
jup
Yes mine is the Asus a320m k the cheapest a320 board in the market at the time I bought it Just with a bios update to 6042 and now it can run Zen 3 chip
depends on the motherboard look at the supported CPUs on the manufacturer s website
It will be a huge performance uplift for going from zen 1 I mostly play eSports titles and after upgrade my fps in those increased around 90 across the board
Mary
Aren't the MAX models way better than the Gen 1 OG boards no
thats hard to top
Guess what will happen with AM5
Axing AM4 is not a sign of greed the platform had served its purpose GPU pricing No arguing with that
I'll check that out whenever I'll have the chance Thanks
Sorry I noticed this only now Went with Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 So far idling in windows light load around 30 40 ish C about 15 20 C drop compared to my prior air cooler The heaviest load the cpu went through during stress testing was about 75 C Honestly haven't seen the Temps anywhere near that during normal use Think it was around 165 170W Usually in games it's anywhere between like 50 65 C ish Depending on a game I gotta say absolutely worth it
5700x seems to only be 15 20 faster than a 3600x
give yourself a try with PBO2 Tuner Will cool it and make it run more stable high clocks Start ez with offset 10 on all cores 15 20 If you're lucky you can reach up to 30 on all cores If you're keen you can workout which core will make 30 which core works stable with 25 I made it easy and just run 25 on all cores For all details and deeper view take a look at
It's mainly for people who want to upgrade to max out AM4 now and use it for many years New builders should either save money with a 5600 5700X or buy AM5 B550 5800x3D 32GB of 3600 CL 16 is about the same cost as B650 7600 32GB of DDR5 6000 You could go for a weaker kit or less capacity but if you're gonna go 5 years without upgrading since you have no upgrade path you probably should get the sweet spot RAM before it gets more expensive later
you basically have to start smashing the button to enter the bios the moment you pressed the Power button on your PC
What games Depends very very much
Shh this is no place for reason or facts
Yeah the decision is 1440p ultrawide or a r7
Still cant decide though xD
Am5 boards are incredibly expensive in my country a decent x670 is almost same as r7 5800x3d I know a decent b650 is also totally capable but they're 2 3 price of x670 so r7 5800x3d looks pretty good Though the reason I'd go for it is that I'm thinking of upgrading to 1440p 240hz oled monitor from 165hz shitty fhd va so
You are wrong about this AMD actively stopped AIBs from supporting new CPUs You got it reversed Its not motherboard makers fault It was AMD stopping motherboard makers from supporting new CPUs Ref
exactly and yet you still have options to go for a 5800x3d or higher so you can prolong the life of that system by a few years on a 75 board
for you it does not for many it does and still having the option to upgrade the cpu after 4 years is a very nice bonus let's say i bought the top cpu from amd the 1800x 4 years later i buy the top of the line cpu again the 5950x or 5800x3d with this setup i can easy do another 5 years so this way i can go 9 years with only buying a cpu in between and having still top notch performance you won't prob with that crappy 6 year old cpu so in the end it does matter
But you can upgrade long after new parts come down Like someone who bought Zen 1 in 2017 could get a 5800x3D in 2024 It also compresses used pricing a lot With Intel many mainstream high end CPU's stay expensive in the used market because they're the best or near the best one that most boards can handle For example the cheapest Buy it now working 9900k is going for nearly 300 dollars on eBay And many are more than 300 But with AMD the 5600 being 140 new means the 3600 is under 100 used which means the 2600 is under 50 The 3700x is like 130 on eBay has the same amount of cores and is only a tiny bit slower in gaming In theory Zen 3 used pricing could be high but AMD is keeping Zen 3 in production for so long due to so many upgrading that there's probably gonna be WAY more Zen 3 out there than Zen 2 and Zen 1
Indeed I'm really happy with it but I reckon I could have gotten away without it haha
Idk thats what people said to me
I just remember back with Zen 2 there was a ton of PR stuff and angry folks being angry that Zen 2 wouldn't work for 300 series boards and now it works for Zen 3 Unofficial support or
Which motherboard Does it list official support on the specsheet or how do you tell if it can work with official support Because it shows that my ASUS PRIME B350 Plus does not officially support Zen 3 with further investigation suggesting that AMD cut official support
This is dumb I cannot afford a Porsche car but that does not make me hate it
And at the moment or the next couple of years it doesnt matter if they support PCIe5 0 for most people even on this subreddit
so no one is forcing you to buy anything
Thank you very much
That would be great thank you very much for information
So glad I did quite a big performance jump from a 2700x
Yeah I'm speaking for 1080p mostly 1440p it's a better choice what you did
And then I realize that i have a 3070 So it would be what 5 10fps
Not really Saving up 1 700 was tough for me Everyone always assumes people with something nice are rich No I just saved up my money for something nice that would make me happy Happiness and buying something nice aren't exclusive to having tons of disposable income
Same upgraded from 1600 to 5700x with the B350F Let celebrate our 2017 decision to go with AMD instead of Intel
Ok you should consider it for future upgrades
Good to see someone not just assuming they will It's not guaranteed the cache is a bottleneck to the same degree as on 5000 series now DDR5 is in the mix I'll find the reviews interesting when it finally lands
Made the same jump cannot believe how much smoother games are in terms of 1 lows
Do you want to upgrade to an AM5 platform soon Don't get the 5800x3D If you stay on AM4 heckyea The 5800x3D is the best AM4 chip in terms of gaming performance For years to come 8 cores most games just use 6 or less So yea i'd say get one if you have the money What gpu do you have
be quiet Pure Loop 2 FX 280mm Temps don't get higher than 65 degrees This is in my nzxt h7 flow case
I feel like the main diff are 2 active ccds instead of one
This just depends on when the motherboard was manufactured Normally they flash the newest stable version on it then If your board was made after 2021 You should be fine If your board was made before 2021 You will need an update x200B Also some mainboards didn't get the update for the 5000 series Mainly some low end b350 boards or x370 boards So have a look at the support site of your mainboard befor you consider upgrading
B550 came out after x570 tho to be precise
Actually x570 came out at zen 2 launch not 3
Not all x570 boards came with a 5000 bios not even close Mine didn t x570 extreme4 x570 came out way earlier than Ryzen 5000 did
Did the same last week
Would you mind explaining the process to me My 5800x3d gets hot while gaming 85c 92c so underclocking sounds great I ve only been able to find a GitHub thread about PBO2 is that what I should be following
It would be way better for gaming performance contrary to what other comments are saying
Thanks
I have a gigabyte one and found all the supported processors list Type Product Value 6753 Type Product Value 6753
How does the power delivery hold up I have an ASRock board and want to go with a 5700x only found Korean videos on YouTube so only reading the graphs the performance seems to tank in continuous benchmark runs even for a 5800X3D or a 5600 might buy a 5600 if power delivery isn't enough or just switch to DDR5 and get a new build
The thing is with those a320 s is because of the capacitors used it makes it really good for gaming I actually saw a couple of YouTube videos with direct comparisons and an explanation why they are so good
I was a bit disappointed how little difference I got going from a gtx970 to a rx6600xt then I realised I mostly play cpu intensive games
Joseph
Wouldn't say way better Main practical differences were it only supported up to 3466mhz DDR4 and lower onboard BIOS chip capacity At the time people were questioning the longevity of the lower capacity BIOS chip and whether it was big enough to support future CPU's but they did in the end at the expense of making the BIOS look more like your old school text ones instead which some people actually prefer anyway The 3466mhz limit is not ideal in terms of maximising Infinity Fabric by getting 3600mhz RAM or OCing it to that but it's less of an impact on 5000 series as it was on 1000 2000 and to a lesser degree 3000 series Most people that were already on a budget when they bought into the ecosystem probably got 3200 cl16 kits anyway
And that's one of the reasons why I'm skeptical of the AM5 is worth its high price for CPU longevity when that is completely at the mercy of AMD's decision of when to axe later CPU support to what chipsets
I also recommend checking out Fan Control on github But yes setup your hysteresis and fan response time You can open up programs and the fans won't ramp up because of a two second temp increase Maybe something like a 5 10 degee increase and a similar delay in seconds so that it will still respond fast enough for a Cinebench run or something
With 5700x you get 8 cores in 1 CCX rather than 2x3 cores each in separate CCX This completely changes the cross core latency table A sizeable improvement for gaming in that regard Plus you get two extra cores plus you get higher IPC plus you get a bit higher clocks For gaming the extra cores might not be doing that much but they can help at times with background tasks which could screw up your 1 lows on a 6 core machine Look modified attribute just means that SMT fix is applied early version of Cyberpunk 2077 needed to be fixed for Ryzens Look at Ryzen 5 3600XT Modified vs Ryzen 7 5800X Modified Psycho RT by the way because RT stresses CPU as well These are not exactly 3600x vs 5700x but it's only a few clockspeed difference between that and 3600xt vs 5800x So yes technically only 20 faster but that can be the difference that makes or breaks your 60Hz experience for example The 1 lows improvement cannot be understated You can pair a 5700x with a powerful GPU and get most of the performance you might want out of it but 3600x will be a troublesome bottleneck in some of the more demanding RT games and it's something you simply cannot get around DLSS3 might help if you go Nvidia RTX 40 route but you'd still want a 5700x over a 3600x then to have a higher CPU performance starting point Of course if your budget is much higher you'd just change the platform to something modern and DDR5 based but that's way more costly
That's the generational single core performance uplift Similar to from 3600 to 5600 but I think a 6 core CPU isn't going to cut it in the long run A 5800x3d is about 15 20 faster than a 5700x but it varies heavily from game to game 5800x3d is simply the best there is for AM4 but in terms of bang for buck there are better options
I jumped from a Ryzen 3600 to a 5700x and it was a massive jump I getting 20 fps and 1 low fps as well like 20 which makes the experience a LOT smoother than the 3600 at 1440p Are you talking about useless benchmarks and bullshit reviews Or personal experience because I'm talking from the real time experience
It's crazy I went from hitting 90 instantly to hovering just below 85 running Cinebench with a solid performance gain
I am confused why nobody uses the AutoPBO feature It set my 5700x to between 20 and 30 Didn't have to do any testing and has been rocksolid eversince
I highly recommend this Due to the stupid proprietary clip attachment my 280 Fractal AIO couldn't keep the CPU from hitting thermal limits and throttling PBO tuner made a huge difference and I ended up replacing the clip attachment with a standard four screws mounting bracket Barely breaks 80 in stress testing tools now Amazing
Oh trust me I do It's literally that the keyboard doesn't receive power quick enough before windows is booted up
BF2042 Hogwarts Legacy are the once I play right now For Hogwarts I'm at about 20 30 CPU
take your time for both will be a good time
Why not go 5600x or 5700x and save 50 of the 5800x3d cost that can be added to monitor budget The performance difference is not that big between these CPUs ofc it a bit considers the game you play most
Yeah you probably won t be needing an upgrade in the next year or two once it s time AM5 mobos will be cheaper Then you can decide but I would heavily lean towards AM5 as AM4 is EoL
Did you forgot how many times amd wanted to ax support for zen3 on older boards It was only until intel got competitive that amd magically gave zen3 support to non 500 series mobos
Higher the resolution least chances of cpu bottleneck It's all about gpu power in high resolutions like 4k not cpu Your 5600 will do just fine
Official Look at your mobo page on manufacturers website to see if they added support
It's official support AMD flat out lied about the 300 series boards not being able to support Zen 3 They went as far as forcing board makers to take down beta BIOSes that added support After AMD spent a year or so giving varying reasons for why it couldn't work with the majority of it being proven false they suddenly said that it would work Once AMD gave the green light to it being OK all the board makers released BIOS updates
ASUS Prime X370 Pro And the 5600x is in the list of supported CPUs for this board on the website When looking at the supported CPU list for your board ASUS Prime B350 Plus it lists a lot of the 5xxx CPUs as supported with BIOS 6042 The list includes the 5800X3D Here's the URL I hope it loads for you model2Name PRIME B350 PLUS
When the next generation of cars is Porsche prices for a basic Citroen people have a right to complain
It doesn't make you hate porshe because if you want a cool two seater there are tons of options including the nice looking and much cheaper MX 8 among tons of others If you want a modern AMD system it's just AM5 mobos And they are indeed overpriced
Yes I have the 3070 as well I know for a fact that the main difference is in the 1 lows which are drastically increased and you wont see any fps dropping on your GPU but then again the difference between both at 1440p is like 15 to 20 more fps on the 1 low for 100 more the so I can sell my 5700x for cheap and get the 5800x3D cheap as well right now I'm ok I'm more invested in upgrading to an RTX 4080 or 4070TI for 1440p gaming
something nice are rich Is not that you are rich or not I spent 1300 dollars on a scalped 3070 I needed it urgently and the shortages seemed eternal and has been one of the worst mistakes I have made in terms of monetary management it's because you spend in the margin of your possibilities lets say you won 100k on a lottery or something like that and you are broke you have other expenses and things to get in charge but you decide to use that money on a 50k dollars car without having the income to maintain it That's why most people consider that if you are spending money on something that it's high Ultra end you probably have the means to maintain the hardware and that you don't have any other urgent needs to cover otherwise it would be dumb to pay 1800 dollars on a GPU when you have to pay a loan or you barely end the month with food
While true the fact that the cpu doesn't have to access the RAM at all is why the techology works so well to begin with It's always going to be faster That said I wonder if there will be a point of diminishing returns on performance like you were saying
When I see it on sale I was thinking of doing the upgrade My GPU isn't the most recent one though with an Radeon RX 5600 XT But it gives me what I need for what I play atm so no compalints about that card for now
Its the break out of the IO die actually The 5900x is capable of dumping all of its non io die TDP into a single die But yeah multiple dies is great for temps
x570s are the latest am4 motherboards x570 are different from x570s The s stand for silent since they stopped putting those useless chipset fans
And that's exactly what i said Lol EDIT Aight i saw your other reply Is all good D
Yep The GitHub instructions are the one to follow Just a correction undervolting is different to underclocking Undervolting is reducing the voltage to the component thus reducing temperatures which allows PBO to boost clocks for longer indefinitely by reducing eliminating thermal throttling Underclocking would be instructing the processor to reduce GHz This would reduce temp as well but at the expense of performance Undervolting is a bit more complex but for the most part will reduce temperatures at the expense of potentially making the processor unstable as it's reducing voltage which may be required to keep the processor stable at certain clocks Because the 5800X3D is top binned silicon and it's primary constraint is usually it's temperature due to its unique feature of 3D Cache it can usually be undervolted pretty reliably with minimal instability Because the chip is pretty locked down by AMD the way you do this is by applying an offset using PBO Tuner If I were you I'd follow the instructions on GitHub and just set 30 right off the bat If you don't find your computer is unstable when the computer is idle then everything should be all good and you won't need to tweak it Also it's worth mentioning it you have an MSI mobo their bios is unique where you can do all the stuff in the GitHub instructions by toggling a couple of settings in BIOS instead of all that work If so google KomboStrike and there should be articles that show you how to do it
I did some benchmark for 30 mins of continuous Cinebench and Geekbench with stock settings my processor consumes max at 78W clocks at 4 2Ghz all cores 4 45Ghz single core I think 78 is its PPT value Now I'm running it at 0 225V offset with default PBO2 power consumption max at 56W in all stress test multicore decrease around 8 clock stretched at 3 75Ghz but the gaming performance is almost the same while the processor being 10 C degree cooler Mine is not the ideal settings so I can't tell much but the performance is consistent though my cooler is Thermalright Assassin X
That's still a great card you got there you might get a lot more than me from the upgrade Here I'm still rocking my RX 570 4GB
Phteven
wake up wake up wake
Lol yeah ask Threadripper peeps how they
PLUS it really diminishes the value proposition if the motherboard you're buying costs twice the price it should anyway face with rolling eyes
Interesting I will look into it I don't think it's gonna be an issue on the older pc either way First time having an AIO though if there's any setting I should know or such any tips are very appreciated
Thanks
Hell yeah I love reading 5700x performance reviews I just bought one since everyone is saying it s the best bang for your buck Really excited to try it out with my 2070
5800x3d is factory locked and doesn't support overclocking undervolting out of the box
You can boot into bios from Windows fyi Hold shift and restart then select uefi from the advanced options menu
Been 6 months
I agree with this but I would go with Intel their E cores P cores architecture looks pretty interesting
Thank you thats what i thought but people literally bully me and i worried
I just checked No support for Zen 3 with some explanations that AMD is blocking official support on 300 series motherboards and that it can work if you flash 400 series BIOS If so then it should be the case that OP did it using unofficial BIOS Or am I missing something
There actually were a lot of technical issues I assume them initially removing beta bios was them trying to avoid confusion where some boards could and some couldn't It definitely would have been a shit show imagine buying a board used that got the beta bios and now not being able to use a Zen1 CPU that launched alongside it Some B350 boards were also crap and had issues that needed working around Then during that year they and AIB's worked to overcome the problems Because think about it why would they cut support What business reason is there AMD makes more from CPU's than chipsets hell the X570 chipset is basically a Zen2 I O die so they don't want to force people to upgrade if it means selling way less CPU's And board makers who put in all that work to make beta bioses obviously wanted to release them So I really don't think greed factored into what initially happened with B350
There are reasons for AM5 platform to be expensive There literally was an article explaining that certain components of AM5 motherboards are more complex and are not manufactured in the same volumes as corresponding AM4 parts You are comparing a 5 year old mature platform with one that is less than 6 months old As I said though the very same people in 5 years would be posting in this sub praising that they put Ryzen 10900X into their 2022 AM5 motherboard
You went to the 5700x from what I'd like to have more stable 1 lows in hopes it would help with VR gaming too Just not sure it is worth it over the 3700x instead of the x3D
So either you're destitute or you have tons of disposable income
Honestly if it wasn't an decent uplift in performance AMD wouldn't be bringing them to market It's just the degree of the gain that's in question I was just stating the dynamics have changed so we shouldn't just assume
In gaming the gpu is sub optimally accessing the ram via the cpu Ideally the game uses just vram So a single very fast step adds 2 extra very slow steps 3d cache turns this into just one additional slow step
Yeah my 5800x won't idle below 45C lol I hate it But it's not necessarily bad though because it never gets above 70C in games though at least with the PBO settings I have
Is it a different chipset Haven't actually read up on x570s variants
I commented on your parent post saying you re wrong But I forgot about x570s being a different thing with passive cooling You re right
Ah right I definitely meant undervolting Thank you for the correction and the through explanation I appreciate it
which one did you bought 5800x3d
I feel your pain with 4 gig vram
Obama
I can taste the salt just going through the old threads when AMD required a new chipset socket for Zen 2 TR and then never got around to Zen 3 TR until right before Zen 4's launch
Or ask the Ryzen 2000 people about ReBAR I know some of us had the vendors enable it anyway I need to try it sometime as well Surely Asrock just said 'f u' to AMD and enabled stuff anyway like they always do lol I don't even care about Pcie Gen 4 lol I just want my rebar
Nice 600 board you got there We decided that it won't run Zen 6 or 7 because Intel s the bed again and now we hold the CPU performance crown You can buy a newer 100 board for Zen 6 or 7
I'm literally pairing a brand new Ryzen 7 5700x with a used 2070 Super in a PC at my house in two days
I see thx
New bios updates do on Asus ROG B550 Can use the curve optimizer at least to undervolt
Yeah I tried that and the uefi was not an option for some reason Just got lucky on trying to reboot again
It s interesting but doesn t warrant a purchase over AM5 Intel 1700 will be EoL soon and it s not even much cheaper than AMD right now
AMD is not blocking official support If your board doesn't have support that's on your mobo maker
AMD was originally not promising it because it is not as easy as flipping a switch so they were cautious and the whole fanbase overreacted as usual
Don't forget that AMD was originally going to not allow 400 series boards from supporting Zen 2 processors and it wasn't until a lot of pushback from consumers that AMD recanted There actually were a lot of technical issues Such as All of the technical issues that kept being pushed around here have been proven to be false It definitely would have been a shit show imagine buying a board used that got the beta bios and now not being able to use a Zen1 CPU that launched alongside it You mean like buying a retail board with a retail BIOS and not being able to support a CPU then needing to use AMD's official program where they would loan you a low end processor just so you can update the BIOS to one that supports newer CPUs The problems with not being able to support a CPU because of a too old BIOS has been a problem with motherboards for decades same for random boards not providing updates What business reason is there AMD makes more from CPU's than chipsets hell the X570 chipset is basically a Zen2 I O die so they don't want to force people to upgrade if it means selling way less CPU's AMD has wafer commitments to make with Global Foundries AMD needed to pump up the numbers as much as they could which wouldn't happen when users were upgrading from 300 and 400 series chipsets being proved by ASMedia Forcing users to upgrade many to the X570 being fabbed by GloFo gave AMD a large headroom in meeting the wafer commitment
I think the entry level B650 that doesn't even have PCIe 5 0 is overpriced though Imo the main reason boards are priced this way is because AMD raised the TDP so much originally On AM4 your Ryzen 5's all used 90W PPT and Ryzen 7's were 90W 140W PPT Ryzen 9 was a better binned Ryzen 7 so its power consumption was also pretty fair Your higher end X570's were more expensive but built to handle CPU's that pulled more power But at Zen4 launch every board needed to be able to support at least a 7600X The 7600X PPT is about the same as the 5800x which itself was significantly over the 5700x most would buy instead That's why AMD boards were consistently cheaper than Intel ones they could downgrade the VRM and VRM cooling and not have issues I'm hoping since Zen4 initially went too far on the power performance curve and has now backed off that we'll see A620 and B650 boards release for cheaper that can handle your 90W R5's
I'm sure it'll be a fantastic uplift as ddr5 6000mhz isn't fast enough when you compare to 8000mhz ddr5cand much lower latency on intel
Not always true there are plenty of examples where all cpu manufacturers have and will continue to implement certain things that are not fully optimized to either gamble on a future technology or to see if there is even an active market for this technology That being said I would hope they wouldn't pull such a gamble with something as crucial as running 're talking about
For sure
I think the rumors were 20 30 faster than the 5800X3D
Google gamers nexus waste of sand
The running of the game itself yes but during steps like compiling shaders this access feature can save a bunch of time 3d cache advantages aren't even about speed though which is why I find it odd were even going this avenue with discussions and promoted features from AMD It's main advantages are about density increased cache reduces calls to RAM and therefore access times go down Also with transistor sizes it's one of the few known methods to reduce memory corruption from stray or runaway energy as they are getting so close electrons have the ability to just hop to a neighbor transistor and that doesn't even factor in cosmic radiation effects Speed how I have understood it is a very small benefit and one we weren't trying to solve with its application
Are you sure there isn't an issue with your cooler or paste My 5800x idles at 22C and gets to around 50C depending on what game I'm playing
Less temperature switching and range is better for longevity of the CPU though It's what i selected my x5959 to perform like On purpose Not lower than 40 and not higher than 75 And not fast switching of voltage and speed thus less heat differences and hotspot differences It's much better like that so the cpu won't have bank crack at hotspots Since the temp gauges are also just an indication Of it measures 90 there can be hotter spots on crucial areas Depends on how much you want to gamble on having to buy a new one Since a new x5950 is 500 bucks I'll wait with experimenting further when it's 50 bucks
As i said it's the same as the x570 The only difference is that they stopped putting the chipset fans hence why S for silent That s doesn't stand for plural It's actually the chipset name
Oh ok lmao I was like 's exactly what i said aside the x570S xD All good bro
Let me know how much of a difference it is I dont have a super but im going from a ryzen 7 2700 to the 5700x
Good to see some manufacturers allowing it most others I have a Gigabyte x570 are still locked
No no I'm not talking about right now in the future when my 5700x starts to seriously have performance issues with games at 1440p beaming face with smiling eyes For now I'll maintain myself just upgrading the GPU exclusively
I remember that from when it happened But if they updated it then why not my board Just random chance that they didn't bother with this specific board or is it for all of them
Good stuff ta
Are you sure you're reading the right CPU temperature It should be something like CPU CCD TDie or something like that The regular average CPU or something like that isn't the temp to look at but if that's not the case you have some insane temps I use an NZXT X73 360mm AIO with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste What are your clock speeds during games and how many watts is your CPU using Mine uses about 90 110 watts under loads and games
Weil I was suggesting that to u AciVici not to you Whether AMD or Intel will be worth it more in the future no one knows P E cores isn t a reason to buy Intel it s useless for gaming and the E cores aren t that strong anyway Good for Laptops irrelevant for Desktop PCs
Maybe you got unlucky and your board maker decided not to bother
Your board im using a x370 board with 5700x had 1600x so yea
Using Ryzen Master for all my reports says 50C to 55C for temp peak speed around 4 5 4 6 GHz CPU power between 50 to 65w Tested with Age of Empires 4 against 7 AI for more CPU usage The Division 2 and Assassins Creed Odyssey For my cooling I have a Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste and a Lian Li II Mesh Performance case for good airflow v JSLWewcieY My temps are similar to what Steve tested for the case temps under load as seen above v Vex9 84VpYs t 52s Has thermals tested for a 3950X which should be hotter than a 5800x or similar The AIOs all run sub 50C while great air coolers run around 50 under load Maybe your AIO isn't getting good contact with the CPU
Interesting I've looked at the contact on my AIO two times before and tried different ways to tighten the cooler down but the temps remain the same My CPU could possibly have a high spot on the metal having an air gap leading to increased temperatures though I checked my thermal paste and it doesn't seem to be covering the entire CPU evenly Just one spot with a noticeably less amount of thermal paste on it but either way I don't think there should be almost a 20C difference because of that My AIO is pretty new and the pump definitely still works Also one thing to note according to you you're only pulling 65 watts max but I'm pulling more than double that at 120w and my temps are getting to 74C under tress testing I have my max PPT set to 120w in my PBO limits Edit I'm pulling 85w CPU core power CPU Power in Ryzen Master and it says 100 of 120w PPT so I don't know which wattage you're reading
Looking forward to AIB models Thinking about going team Sapphire Pulse
3 stripes for RDNA 3
It does look nice Hopefully its performance doesn't disappoint
I have never had a reference card before but RDNA3 looks kinda cute
AMD is pretty damn good at making sexy cards
I think it's finally time I part ways with Nvidia This card is just so impressive After spending 2 years with a 3080 I've come to the conclusion raytracing cuda and reflex aren't necessary for me And with a card this powerful there will be no need for DLSS FSR In terms of price to performance power usage aesthetics no stupid PSU cable adapter pretty much everything AMD wins this time around
It looks so much better than the 4090 wouldn't mind having this reference card in my pc
This card looks compact af Like sure not as small as my EVGA RTX2060 single fan but it wouldn t be a bothersome install in a smaller case This is the most impressive thing for me along with the power consumption for some reason I really hope the 7600 will be priced well I ll definitely go for that if so
This is not true The fins inside are black Whatever is happening in this photo is an effect of the light sources in the room The fins are black Those three at the end are painted on the edge and that's it
This might be the first time I want a reference card over an AIB card
That is a
Gonna be honest the new 7900xt card looks amazing to me better than any Nvidia reference aib or any other AMD cards That black and red is just killer
I really wish I didn't snag that 12gb 3080 for 700 a couple of months ago
If it can match the 3090 Ti in RT and other capabilities I will definitely consider it a really good upgrade for the price For my use case at least
Sexy card Would buy
That's not actually painted it's reflections of the light emitted by the glowing red core which is burning hot with Nvidia's hopes and dreams
I m deciding to go amd this generation to punish nvidia for their insane pricing It will be the first time I spend more then 500 on a graphics card and I m not happy about it but I don t want to wait for the mid tier rdna3 cards to come out in a year I need something now I m without a gpu u til December and no guarantee I will even be able to source one of these cards The whole thing has left a sour taste in my mouth honestly Even mid tier cards are 500 now it s untenable
This a a very nice looking card I like AMD design much better than Nvidia
Currently have a 3080Ti FTW3 with a 5900x but I'm buying the 7900XTX when it comes out because I'm still madd at how Nvidia is treating AIBs and normal consumers with these ridiculous prices Granted 1000 is still a lot for a graphics card but still
That's one good looking card
Rad Eon
It's because heat is red and the fins grab all the heat
Powercolor all the way
It looks like design is taken from evga card family
Is there red rgb around the rim like on the 6900xt If so will def be a buy
If I was concerned about looks or price I'd definitely go for a 7900 XTX Nice card Hopefully forces Nvidia to drop 3080 and 3070 pricing to compete for those who want this tier range
At 3000 upvotes this feels like a shitpost lol I upvoted too ofc
Red with the blood of a million RTX card sales
I really do not like that red stripe makes what would otherwise be a very classy looking card look like a daddys money bmw looking forward to seeing the partner cards and hopefully some of them have a more stealth look and aren't needlessly huge
A close up of this was posted on this sub reddit about a week ago if you need a better shot
It would be much easier to just run a big batch of red fins than to come in after the fact and try to paint them
Me just waiting for Powercolor to drop the Liquid Devil version
Indeed
I thought it was copper
Ok that's pretty neat
My BMW friends tell me the stripe makes it go faster
Yah and it looks so good
Me want
U think i should upgrade from 3090 or jump next yeat to 8xxx or 5 series
I could stare at those fans all
Isn't it just three copper fins without any paint
I'm sure it's actually anodised rather than painted Any paint on it will impact how much heat it radiates and will insulate it instead
precise boost 2 0 activated
Sexy x200B Now send the card to me
I really want to grab a Red Devil
Painted red on the
gotta say these are the sexiest cards this gen so far
isn't painting the fins like not good for thermal transfer
Everyone knows Red makes everything go FASTAH
I m excited to own my first AMD product as long as it preforms somewhat close to a 4090
I still have my Fatal1ty Zalmans
I built a dual 6700XT through XFX and I really wanna go above and beyond and upgrade BOTH to something as powerful as these bad Bois
When is the benchmark embargo
I love AMD's RX 6000 cooler designs they're so sexy more industrial than gamer I actually kind of regret that I got an XFX rather than a reference card but XFX was what was available
Beautiful design
Genuinely curious theoretically let s say I switch to an AMD card over NVIDIA what all am I missing out on Never owned an AMD card before but their pricing compared to NVIDIA is hard to ignore
Do we know they arnt just copper fins
Are the 7000XTX reference card only available during launch period on Amd online store or throughout 3 years availability
Nice touch It looked all black in the videos I've seen
I will say the new 7000 series is not fancy but still modern sleek and a clean design
You know I never really liked the look of 6000 series cards But this card This card is sexy I like how it's a deeper black housing instead of standard plastic great The polygonal shaping and the 3 fins The more I see it in videos the more I want to get it
damn that looks nice
What does this mean
Can anyone catch me up on the features of the 7000 series AMD reference designs Thanks
Best shroud design they have had yet
Probably easier to just make 3 red fins and throw them into the install stack at appropriate intervals than to paint the edge of 3 fins red without fucking up anything else
That is so nice looking Would be great for my set up
NGL the card looks segsy
I really like the design of the AIB
Wow 5 more fps increase firefire
Only 3 of the fins are red cuz it's RDNA 3 I know this is obvious but I told my friend and it blew his mind So I'm just making sure everyone is aware to avoid embarrassing yourself
What is the width height of the 7900xt xtx It's not mentioned on amd website
it looks so small since i got used to 4090 pics
That s fucking stupid and I hate it I don t want a specific color accent on a thousand dollar gpu Keep it black and let it have RGB to pick colors It completely ruins a black build if the build s accents aren t red
catch BRO WHO IS DROPPING A 7900 XTX LIKE THAT
The RDNA 3 design looks amazing Thinking about picking up a Reference RX 7800
How would one paint the fins on a heatsink Wouldn't the paint reduce the fins' cooling efficiency
Mmm spicyy
This product has sold out and is temporarily out of stock
This GPU looks so cool
It would be weird and janky to literally paint a tiny sliver of a fin Probably harder to do I don't know why people think ohhhhhhhhhOHOHOHOHHHHhh What attention to detail about this
to be honest the new 7000 card looks really cool like Transformer
That is by far the best looking graphics card I ve seen in a long time
What do people think the odds are that selectively coloured fins become a trend in GPU and or CPU coolers
That card actually looks pretty good at that angle
Where can you buy these things Or when if not now
Will 7900xtx be non referent in shops on 13 dec already
I would chuck it into a wall
This design will probably suck assuming that it has the same radiator size
Will the AIB card be available at the same time
I could see it better if it were in the trash where it belongs face with tears of joy
So I currently have a 6800 XT installed in my mini ATX case will the upcoming 7900 XTX fit based on the released dimensions notes
Reference cards have come a long way and I'm all here for it I have high hopes for this series
Would it be bottlenecked by ryzen9 5950 And gain anything from both being amd
this is not paint it's the color of the copper xDDD
Been on 5600XT Pulse and it's been really great Very quiet and good temps for years If there is a 7600 or 7700 Pulse that'd be amazing
Never had an AMD card but it seems like Sapphire is to AMD what EVGA was to Nvidia The dedicated high quality AIB I would go with Sapphire in a heartbeat they always look great imo
Sapphire is a no brainer for amd cards
I was sold on their Nitro RX 6950 XT Pure because of the extreme high build quality and beautiful design I can t wait to see what design they come up with on this new generation of cards
Wonder what they are gonna do with a Toxic version They're always nutty and just outlandish but look right
Sapphire and PowerColor seem to be the top AMD first party brands from what I gather
Got me a pulse 6800xt very happy
Wonder what they are gonna do with a Toxic version They're always nutty and just outlandish but look right
I'm considering Sapphire and Powercolor when I upgrade next year People always say they make the best AMD cards I've only had MSI cards
Been a long time since I've been in the GPU market and I have no idea what AIB stands for As far as I can tell it means the other companies that make cards with those GPUs so like EVGA would be an AIB All I can think of when I see that is All In One but the B ends up being something else All In Bone That can't be it
100 I'm hoping there are some proper Monster AIB cards and that the rumours of performance overclocking headroom left on the table is true
Nitro if you can swing it
I had a 5700xt pulse If their previous work is anything to go by you will not be dissappointed
I have a sapphire nitro 6900XT SE OC While the name is slightly over the top the card itself is absolutely amazing and I'd buy it again
How long after AMD's reference release will they come out with their own version Weeks or Months historically Never bought AMD before
Best cards had earlier Vapor X coolers HD 5770 HD 7950 lastly RX580 Nitro all great Went 3090 for needs of CUDA otherwise would go Sapphire again
Will 7900xtx be non referent in shops on 13 dec already
Adidas picking up AMD after dropping Ye
As we all know these three painted rims increase performance by at least 30
Red makes it go fasta
Presentation alone doesn't disappoint in the current market What's disappointing is following Nvidias trend 780 Ti and on have really borked the market prices of lots of hardware and the willingness of consumers to buy them really puts a wrench in accessibility to the average gamer 499 flagship GPU's was a pretty consistent factor with a few outliers up to the Kepler refresh With the advancements being a lot smaller than what we used to see between generations it's quite sad
Based on AMD's comparison to the 6950 XT if the numbers they presented are correct as usual with these presentations take them with a grain of salt it would fall just a few percent at most behind the 500 less If they were even remotely honest it won't disappoint
Honestly performance isn't even that import with AMD The interesting part is if they finally managed to write drivers that don't crash 2 times a
Their reference cards have been looking real nice since RDNA 2 Glad they finally ditched the blower design
Unless you're in USA you'll never see one of these in the wild AMD doesn't give a shit about serving Europe And then all board partners will make fat chungus cards and force me to Nvidia again
Nothing as clean as the reference designs
Really looking forward to the XFX designs they always come up with some crispy looks
Do you really spend a grand on a new graphics card every single generation
there will be no need for DLSS FSR Exactly what I was thinking I'm not playing 4K most games playing at 100fps is already more than enough and for sure will push 200fps on e sports games
This unreleased graphics card with no independently reviewed performance results is impressive
Which CPU would you pair it with The upcoming Zen 4 X3D I'm considering replacing my current i7 3770k gtx 1080
Same boat here I ve got a 3080 and don t use the NVIDIA specific features all that much And I would love to daily Linux so I m going for the XTX
And with a card this powerful there will be no need for DLSS FSR Someone else figured it out It always baffles me why people want to buy a 1500 card just to undersample and make their graphics look like shit when it can run native high res with exceptional performance and no artifacts Upscaling belongs on 150 cards except they cant run it effectively
Went from a 3080 10G to a sapphire extreme edition 6900XT I don't miss the RTX The kids benefit from a beefy 3080 and I have way more VRAM for VR gaming to boot
The way you guys phrase your hardware choices is so weird to me You always make it sound like you're leaving an actual human relationships looks like it's time for me to part ways with Team X Y sorry Dude it's just a GPU
Can I buy yours
Yeah if you don't need those features or plan to VR then AMD is a no brainer
DLSS FSR is still necessary at 4k Power usage difference is 95w not much in terms of a high end gaming system Aesthetics are subjective And you don't need a PSU cable adapter if you have a newer PSU which many will upgrade to with a new system anyways AMD might win you over but they themselves admitted they cannot compete with the 4090 So for those who want the most power 4090 is the only choice
Don't jinx it There has been no reviews and AMD went backwards with their slides making vague charts and terrible comparisons with FSR instead of raw performance Don't reward them for being shitty like Nvidia and wait for independent reviews
if only there is like R9 Nano again a powerful dwarfs
It's probably a copper finstack You get the same effect on radiators painted black
Came to say this It's something to do with the camera shot
I would like to agree but if was due to external light sources wouldn't all the other parts of the GPU or the hands be giving off a red hue as well Here is another angle from another channel Jay2centz instead of GamerNexus They were clearly at different locations in the conference room but this red hue is also captured in his shots as well t 244
Sapphire never made the reference GPUs AMD has them made by PC Partner owns Zotac and makes coolers for a few brands including Nvidia It seems Sapphire may have some affiliation with PC Partner but it seems hard to find details on that
Usually the reference coolers are made by cooler master if I remember correctly
Yeah I visually much prefer the reference amd cards and founders edition NVIDIA cards So much sleeker than these wild AIB designs
BRO the 3080 12gb for 700 is a steal
I got a 6800XT for 595 last week and have zero regrets Just because it won t be the newest series of cards anymore it still slaps
My projections is it is within 10 so 33fps vs 30fps in CP77 4K ultra RT
According to projections it can't match in rt
I like this theory
1000 in 2022 is 900 in 2021 dollars
i like this theory
let us have fun a little bit moai
Their official renders have red lines why would they post engineering samples in their renders
The Radeon logo and those white pieces around the middle fan are RGB
Sorry to disappoint but the reference cards were the smallest AMD cards last generation and the trend will probably continue moving forward
You mean the leaked photo Because this was released two days ago In the leaked photo it was a shot taken straight on the fin stack so it didn't show the red glow at all
Red strips add 10hp on cars and 10fps in cards
Brb gotta change underwear
Skip a series for sure
Skipping a gen is the best economic choice
No wasn't referring to the obvious three red ones but the surrounding fins giving off a red hue
Sorry for the lack of the proper technical term
Used the wrong term just learned that it should be anodized
LTT predicts that it is
Dec 12 a day before release but leaks should be much sooner
Tbh XFX still looks sleek af and is not screaming Gamerrzzzzzz to me
Only CUDA is missing
Even so this never happened on my 6800XT midnight black edition so it is a nice aesthetic touch
using the 6000 series as an example it was available until a refresh was introduced like the 6x50XT cards but initially they did say reference cards were limited production but decided to extend it indefinitely
you see how the black heat sink is glowing red not the three stripes
11mm longer same width and height same 2x 8 pin fans seem to be same size extra rgb on the XTX version and temperature sensor on each fan
Should be safe to assume the same as 6800XT
Sorry proper term is anodize
check out the new asus strix design it looks like optimus prime
December 13 on their direct online store
Yes it should or even before
usually reference design cards run the hottest because they are the most compact not requiring 4 whole slots perfect for people who want powerful graphics in SFF
Yes should all be
interesting that you come to this 19 day old thread to ask but as long as you get the reference model it should fit most mini ATX case heck I have a 6700xT same length in an ITX case and they have clearance up to 300mm which this one goes to 287
should be good at 4K could gain more with X3D besides smart memory access being optimized there might be smart video access coming for encoding decoding
smart
I have a 5700 XT Nitro SE and it s great My previous card was an RX 580 Pulse and that was good Next card for my main system will definitely be Sapphire
I'll be curious about the RAM for these two It'll make it or break for me it if they only do 8gb
Also excited to see the 7700 I don't like giant cards lol
Saphire Vega 56 was also already quiet I miss it a lot and wonder if every big GPU is quiet My new and small RTX 3060 ti is certainly not lol
Is the pulse really that good I'm gonna pick up a 6700xt rn the pulse is at 340 usd where I'm at and the gigabyte eagle is 360 usd the eagle is a triple fan whereas the pulse isn't I forgot what i was actually gonna comment because of how many people here swear by the pulse I genuinely would like to know because I'm gonna be using it for at least 3 years
there are top 3 pick for AMD AIB Powercolor XFX and sapphire
Unlike EVGA they dont have a recent reputation for exploding at the exact 5 year mark Otherwise a reasonable comparison
Never had an AMD card but it seems like Sapphire is to AMD what EVGA was to Nvidia The dedicated high quality AIB I would go with Sapphire in a heartbeat they always look great imo As far as I understand sapphire is AMD's Something along those lines Sapphire XFX and one or two others I'm forgetting are A1 choices
EVGA quality is shit but they have gr8 customer service and warranty owned 4 Evga cards and all of them failed at some point owned 4 gigabytes and 4 Asus and none of them failed I believe sapphire has better quality than most AIBs
At least from a PCB VRM standpoint it's little better than reference Can't speak on their customer service TOXIC Extreme LC cards were cool but obviously not for everyone XFX Asrock and ASUS are likely on par or better build quality in general at this stage
I really liked the Reference personally
POWERCOLOR 3
Add in board iirc And you are essentially right AIB s produce non founders edition GPU s with custom coolers and boards
Been a long time since I've been in the GPU market and I have no idea what AIB stands for As far as I can tell it means the other companies that make cards with those GPUs so like EVGA would be an AIB All I can think of when I see that is All In One but the B ends up being something else All In Bone That can't be it I don't know where the term came from either It's only the last few years I think It's been so long now that I forgotten what I used to call them I think I used to just call them something like non reference designs lol
Me too Can vouch for this I also still have mine
IIRC a lot of models in the 6000 series launched with the reference model dec 8th for the 5700xt it took a couple months though if im remembering right I think we were stuck with reference blowers for a bit
I'd totally stan Dr Lisa Su in full gopnik regalia OK this is what AI thinks this would look like trigger warning CEO of AMD in gopnik regalia
Call it Adidas Red everything's the same but it's red stripes instead of white and there's an amd logo right next to the Adidas logo
ALL DAY I DREAM ABOUUUUUUT SU
Yea but it's red and red is hot
No they did it wrong RGB makes things faster RRR doesn t do shit except making you sound like a seal
OP is not talking about those three fins you can see the red cast within the fins several inches to the left of them
Don t forget the three red arrows on the backplate
Ooooh Love them rims AMD keep em coming
If AMD paints all the fins red will the card go three times faster three times cooler
3 times Like Char Aznable
That ignores inflation and the fact that Titan cards got rebranded as xx90s Plus all of the multi socket cards were about that much in adjusted purchasing power There has been a relative rise in price for the top end but it's not nearly as much as people seem to think
I haven't had issues with Radeon drivers since R
Why do people keep spreading this misinformation
Well if that's the case then more good news
I have AMD for a while now and besides some errors it was not that different like to Nvidia Nvidia still is slightly better but they only have to support GPUs
I ve had maybe 3 issues with AMD drivers and I ve been using AMD cards on and off since 2011 And all of those issues came from an obscure early 2010s AMD laptop with crossfire support between the GPU and APU Probably a good bit of luck in there but I feel like the driver issues are a bit over exaggerated
Eh they both have issues Had some hardware decode issues for several months there But on my Nvidia system I've had hard resets on driver install resulting in failed install unusable hardware decode on a second monitor in Chrome flickering in MWII GFE failing to login etc
Careful Redditors are about to swarm you with anecdotes that they've personally never had issues
Yup I have a reference 6950XT and get at least 1 driver crash a week
And then all board partners will make fat chungus cards and force me to Nvidia again Yes because nvidias cards are so nice and slim
Which is weird since vegas and 5700's were widely available in eu as reference models
I got a reference 6700XT not that hard if you know where to look and when
Idk what you're talking about AMD sold their reference cards for RDNA2 to many European countries UK excluded apparently due to Brexit for MSRP and I saw literally hundreds of people get them through stock alert servers Hopefully won't need stock alerts for long after launch this time And why does a big cooler mean you have to go Nvidia as if board partners dont make big ones for team green This gen it'll probably be worse since they designed coolers for much higher power target because Nvidia didn't clue them in to the switch to TSMC 4N for much better efficiency
Sir I m in europe and i own a reference 6700 XT
AMDs official partners carry reference cards at reasonable prices and during launch window they also sell them on their own store in the EU
I m from Aus and I have a reference card
Sorta true we get usually a single delivery of reference cards in AU but no replenishment once that lot is gone I got a reference 6800 in AU AUD 949 wanted an XT but they were long gone and I wasn't happy with the AIB prices at the time AUD 1249 for an 6800XT seemed terrible at the time when the reference was AUD 1049 little did I know they'd be at 1899 a few months
Sapphire and PC have pretty good looking cards Not even Asus went with 4 slot and they are among the beefiest of boys
We already have reference pre orders in india Around 1200 to 1400 depending on vendor
As a matter of fact I build a whole new PC every 2 years and sell my current one to friends at a very discounted price It's just a hobby of mine the expense is worth it in my opinion like with many other hobbies
A lot of people have more money than you'd think
Yeah TBF he's not gonna be spending a grand 3080 are still selling for at least half that
Everything is relative he could get into collecting whiskey or just buy one bass boat That's years worth of PCs
Just wait until you find out how much it costs to rebuild an old sports car Adult toys are expensive
Well yeah You have a point there I will wait to see more before buying of course But I really like what I'm seeing so far
Lmao right I have seen zero third party proof of performance and they aren't even on the market yet but it looks like it's time for me to leave Team X Y and buy this because Team Good
True but they can't say 1 7x performance gains without actually guaranteeing at least some of that My general rule is that it guarantees at least 30 ish less than what they say so if it's 1 7x at least at a guestimation assume that it's at least a guaranteed 1 4x 1 5x the performance gain And if it turns out it's not when the reviews come out it's pretty much false advertising or it's 1 7x only in a very specific situation
I'm not entirely sure yet I'll have to make that decision when the time comes and everythings in market and reviewed As of now I'm leaning towards the 7900x as a direct upgrade to my 5900x
I'd wait for 3D versions of the CPUs All rumors point to announcement in January and possibly a release a month or two after that By that time even motherboards and DDR5 will drop in price most likely That said take this with a huge grain of salt and an ungodly amount of copium Its still only rumors
Yup Baffles me why Nvidia has locked DLSS 2 for RTX cards and DLSS for 40 series and up Makes no sense It should be the older cards getting support for features that boost performance newer ones don't need it as they have the performance But I guess that doesn't bring in customers the opposite actually and you know how these corporations are these days
It s for 4K or VR
Let's just say I'm in the know and the entire heat sink is black I don't know what the heatsink material is but it's totally black and those three fins are painted red on only the edge
Here is another angle from another channel Jay2centz instead of GamerNexus They were clearly at different locations in the conference room but this red hue is also captured in his shots as well t 244 t 244 or maybe the core coldplate is not anodized black and its reflecting off of it either way pretty cool effect
Listen I'm telling you I've looked at them with my own eyes up close holding them in my hands The heat sink is all black
Agreed and the reference cards from Nvidia also look really nice with the double sided fan design
In late 2022 I'm not so sure
Yeah unfortunately Will just need to wait for the full benchmarks to see which is worth it The 3090 ti will only go down and the AIB of 7900XTX will be higher than the suggested 1k when sold on the market
True lol I think I'm going to try out the Red Devil XTX when it comes out First time I have gone team red for a GPU I really hope lots of others choose team red as well
It is actually stupid that you can't buy a graphics card sized high or even medium end graphics card anymore they are almost always extra wide or stupidly long or probably both They just don't need to be that big and I really don't trust the extra weight they put on a slot even the metal reinforced ones on all the higher end boards these days
Yup picks was leaked a week ish before showing the tri stripe ibthunknits a cool attention to detail
Oh I cant believe I didnt see that I was so focused on figuring out whats wrong with the red stripes beaming face with smiling eyes
Gotcha thanks
Ahh thanks If you would know Do you think that the Ryzen 5800x would fare well with a Standard 7900XT or Even XTX Or do you think the power gap to a newer 7000 series CPU would make it necessary to upgrade Currently have a 3070 Ti Trinity OC the cards performance is solid but I hate it s 8GB of VRAM Already showing it won t age well Was thinking of upgrading to one of these AMD GPU s This December
There probably will be better designs with similar compactness
I'm itching to see more offering Exciting time to be PC builder atm
Currently still on RX480 and going for the 7900XTX I expect to be happy and future proof for some days
I'm not sure what amount is future safe for 1440p I have never had issues yet at 8GB so 10 12GB should be a good amount 8GB again might be a hard buy for the 7700 but resonable for 7600
They ve already announced it There will be 20GB for the 7900XT and 24GB for the 7900XTX
7900XT will have 20GB of VRAM 7900XTX 24GB of VRAM
There is nothing I can specifically say it's a card that does everything you need it to while being quiet and cool for the 5600xt at least I would check reviews for it ofc bigger cooler for 20usd is not a high price to pay though Personally trust sapphire for AMD cards more then gigabyte But have no personal experience with gigabyte except for MB and my current screen both great
when you mention xfx in that list what do you mean i thought the xfx is just the model of
I have an evga 8800gt still going in a family member's computer Plays Battlefield 2 like a dream still I bought that right after they came out That being said I also had an EVGA GTX 570 HD try to burn my house down Good warranty though I'm really looking forward to my next card being a Sapphire My last AMD card was a reference Sapphire Vega 64 I bought to fool around with and it held up to some horrible volt and power mods very nicely
Powercolor Red Devil's
can i ask sapphire make the reference card for the 7900xtx Would this still count as being high quality or are you talking about the custom boards they make
evga cards are the best AIBs ever made to make this statement your saying all cards are shit i follow over 10 professionals who dissemble and repair cards on YT they always state how evga is the best and its a shame they wont be making them
yeah now that AMD have moved away from blower coolers reference is a fine choice
Tyty
Add in board iirc And you are essentially right AIB s produce non founders edition GPU s with custom coolers and boards I've never understood why they call it AIB 's not an add in board
Gotcha thanks Not sure I wanna deal with the dumb cable situation so gonna try AMD this time around
Even got the colours right
Common misconception Red fast bozo
But it clearly hasn t melted so it s okay
But ironically intel is blue
This is golden
That just looks like shiny metal reflecting a light from above giving off a slight brown tint when black and yellow light mix
We had the biggest bouts of inflation between the 90s and late 2000s That's Irrelevant the increases without price changes were consistent until Nvidia decided to dip their toes into higher prices to see what happened All the while there was a memory price fixing scandal during this exact window If consumer trust isn't in the negatives after that it's no wonder GPU's broke 1K
Same The only major GPU issues I ve had ended up being that game or Windows
Been on AMD since 480 and can't really remember a time I thought I need to go to Nvidia for better driver stability I wonder which cards had issues Been on 380 480 580 5600 was it between 580 and 5600 Have had crashes in games that reset the driver but I feel that was caused by the game and the driver resets successfully all the time
i have R9 270 for now gonna get a new build with 6700 XT in 2 weeks never had a single problem with the driver neither the old or the new one
how did u go with nvidia
Because people will pick and choose what fits their narrative most AMD had driver problems 10 years ago and they have been fixed Impossible And remember that nVidia has always won completely ignoring that stuff like the 290x existed and beat the titan But that does not fit my bias so I'm going to ignore all the times amd was better and just focus on the things they have done bad And it happens the other way too I tend to be slightly biased in amd's favor but I always try to be as impartial as possible but I am human too and often have to go back and correct whatever I've written said because only after the fact did I notice I was skewing myself This to say check your biases people Don't accept the first thing you hear because it fits with your world view
Because it literally is my experience with a Vega 56 It has gotten better since September but i still had a few crashes sice then
Yeah I know I really can't understand how so many people can be so ignorant I mean if you never had problems that's great and all but how can you generalize that if the internet heck even this subreddit is filled with AMD driver issues Even Linus from LTT said tge drivers were crap for the longest time
Have you ddu'd your drivers If not do it If yes return it The GPU is faulty
My 3060 ti is strictly a 2 slot blower card
Where do you buy reference cards I know nvidia is through best buy and amazon but where does amd sell through I am planning on upgrading to this card from my 3070
Nah Never existed in Norway
Where can you find them
And I m sure your friends fucking love you
I think a lot of people don't really understand this For a lot of people building PCs is their hobby their are plenty of people who spend much more than 3000 every 2 years or so on their hobbies
I'd probably take up lego or something lol
this is the way
I would love to have that hobby I understand your passion for building PCs
Do you keep the drives or start from scratch with a whole fresh new install every two years
Just like the rest of us
Can we be friends
I do full rebuilds every 5 7 years and incremental upgrades in between I'm almost 3 years into my current build I do the same friend deal I love seeing other people get excited about an upgrade It recoups some of the money plus I know my friends' bitching about lag in discord is just a bunch of lies
It's not even about money I just don't see the point I bought a 3090 on impulse I could do it again but Why
The whiskey makes a lot more sense to me I see my pic as something I upgrade modify and customise over time as a hardware and software passion project The concept of ditching it regularly in the name of enthusiasm just didn't compute for me
I don't buy one of those every two years either
Based on what AMD showed I feel confident but still unsure What I want to see is the improvements to the encoder and how much better it performs
DLSS 2 takes mad VRAM and some hardware level support plus it encourages people to buy a 3090
I'd imagine they're anodised aluminium
That one's news to me but I don't pay much attention to the embedded market
it depends on where you live i guess over here in eu its definetly a steal
I meant the renders on their website have red lines The rest may be over spray
I miss the R9 fury nano
Not in the next gen All AIB are recycling nvidia 3 4 slot coolers onto AMD cards Even last gen was hard to find any card that's 2 slot on the 6800 or under 200mm for the 6700
That is going to be a huge and noticeable jump
Yah thats like jumping up to 20 RX 480's in Crossfire lmao
I am hoping to make the same jump god am I gonna miss my trusty RX480
I'm going to be doing the exact same jump Really looking forward to it
Well the 6700XT is already 12 I m guessing the 7700XT might go 16gb and the 7600XT at 10 12gb And I base that on absolutely nothing
I'm currently on a 5700XT and use some AI image processing
A 5600xt is also not really widely suitable for 1440p so you must be playing less demanding games lower settings in which case 8gb is fine for 1440p and sometimes 4k Plenty of stuff could push that to the limit now though I would recommend a little more
It s more about you If you grow to 4k or VR you re instantly shot
My RTX 3070 is already getting maxed out at 8gb at 1440p I'm selling it
Thanks any info is valuable info
Oh man Battlefield 2 I remember unlocking the Steyr as a medic So fucking hype 17 year old me waited till my parents left on vacation to use some of the food money to upgrade from a 5900xt to a 7900gt when the AGP version came out after the PCI e cuz I had an older DFI LAN Party motherboard from 2003 Just to play that game on max settings
Powercolor Red Devil's Yes that's exactly it Thank you
RED DEVIL ALL
Its technically graphics add in board as opposed to something like a wifi add in board or an audio add in board Daughter board expansion boards yo The modern lingo is just card Graphics card wifi card etc
Actually it's both it's hot because it's going so fast
R comes before B G because of its speed
Purple iz fer da stelthy boiz an' blu is fer gud luck
No Blue fast bozo intel being also blue is just coincidence i didnt mean it as blue is fast because intel is blue
Id say more that its made out of silicon
You know that inflation is multiplicative It doesn't take much for prices to change significantly over the course of couple decades
Windows Your PC ran into a problem Please wait while we troubleshoot
Isn't that exactly a driver issue If your PC crashes when using hardware for specific software it means there is a compatibility problem Unless of course all GPUs crash when trying to run that same software then it would be a software problem
when the 5700 series first launched they had a bunch of driver problems Other than that I had some small issues with HD 5850 none on my 290 none on my 6900XT I did have issues with my 1080 Ti though
You'll like the 6700 xt My motherboard is the problem here Got an h sku for i7 9700kf so my performance is capped didn't entertain ryzen but probably will for next build when current chip dies
I've had an rx480 for years now and had a driver issue exaclty once reinstalling the drivers fixed it My brother bought an rx5700xt near its launch and did have trouble with it but that turned out to be a faulty gpu rma'd it and no issues since Drivers aren't nearly as bad as some people make it seem
I did have an 8800gtx but then flipped back to Radeon for a 7970 and currently a Vega got it second hand after mining
My Vega 64 had severe driver problems The 5700XT was universally known to have major driver problems even well after release Tell me again how it's a 10 year old maymay
This to say check your biases people Don't accept the first thing you hear because it fits with your world view Can you confirm that you have a world view where the issues where 10 years ago and aren't a thing now and people are just pretending that it is Or do you have a different world view I'm hearing lots of reports of HDMI black screens with graphics acceleration in browsers daily in this subreddit so I'm not sure I understand the 10 years ago thing
I've had one since launch and never had it What PSU are you running
Any product that has officially reported issue whether it's GPUs video games home appliances its always going to attract people who insist on rejecting the official story with anecdotes of I've never had any issues Like when vehicle manufacturers issue recalls due to a design flaw like catching fire airbags not working etc Statistically there will be a certain number of people who didn't have that design flaw manifest If you asked those people some will swear up and down that they've never had problems and that the whole problem is some faked crisis AMD themselves admitted that there were driver problems with RDNA1 public statement and everything But statistically speaking just due to the modular nature of PCs some folks won't experience those problems Doesn't mean it wasn't an overall issue
The GPU is faulty You are in no position to say that this is an assumption that you choose make If a DDU doesn't fix the issue it could still be a driver issue that occurs in a specific setup that isn't like yours
Yeah your 30 60 ti not your 3080 This is also the 7900xtx we're talking about not the 7600xt or whatever it will be called
You are comparing a 60 tier card versus a 80 90 series card for cooler size
yeah and my Radeon HD 5450 is a 1 slot passive card oh wait this is a completely different performance class from my card which needs better cooling than it
Got the 6900 xt through their online store in one of the drops
Literally from AMD com and certain retailers too Europe was flooded with 6000XT cards sold directly by AMD last year at MSRP
5 Which countries does the AMD Store ship to US Canada Austria Belgium Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Ireland Italy Luxembourg The Netherlands Portugal Spain and Sweden We are temporarily unable to process shipments to the United Kingdom Unlucky
Actually got mine second hand because I couldnt wait for another drop on
Hahaha probably not smiling face with horns But they are very thankful for the PC's
If you're an outdoorsman absolutely From camping to fishing to hunting those are all huge money sinks That said it's entirely possible to spend little to no money on your hobbies too Reading ebooks or borrowed ones from the library running homebrew ttrpg canpaigns with friends coding programs or designing graphic art swimming or playing your local beer
Having come from modifying cars absolutely right This is how I justify it to my wife Another PC part You d prefer me to get new X on the car
Well said
Lego sets get damn expensive
I'd is the key phrase
Lego sets can very quickly exceed 2000 too if you play with it as much as you do with a PC
Fresh install I have an external HDD that I use to transfer my pictures movies videos pdf's a few games etc on to my new systems I kinda like having the feeling of a fresh windows install with clean drivers Makes it feel like a new PC rather than just an upgrade
You should do a fresh install every year or 2 even if you never change any parts in your PC it greatly speeds up your PC and frees up space even if you literally install every single thing you were using before Though obv a separate NAS or hard drive for family photo's documents
because you are not an enthusiast hobbyist and that's fine
I'm in the UK and a used 3080fe is selling for over 500 considering mine cost be 560 650 new it's no big deal upgrading Edit price was 540 tax 650
Europe is a fucking continent lear the difference between the corrupt European Union and the geographical continent of Europe
I built my first PC in 2007 to play Runescape and CS Source Athlon 64 X2 3800 Geforce 7600 GT and built on to it part by part as I could afford them until 2016 I still have most the old parts I went through from those years I have since grown and kept the same passion just with increased wealth Now I found a way to not only continue my hobby but make my friends happy in the process It's not all for the sake of enthusiasm I'm genuinely helping other people as well as enjoying what I'm doing That really should not make you so upset to be making all these negative comments
Says who Every game I've tried has seen a reduction in VRAM when enabling DLSS otherwise my 3070 would choke at 4k Doom Eternal Metro Exodus Cyberpunk God of War all stay closer to 6 7GB utilization at 4k high settings vs maxing out when DLSS is disabled
I do not know why all of the parther cards just decide to make the craphics card the size of the motherboard almost when the stock amd cards prove that a normal ish sized card can have good enough cooling and power delivery to do what it needs to
Well gotta admit that the quality of reference is below average especially when compared to much better vendors as Sapphire
When I bought it it was a top graphics card But I am looking forward to upgrading and will most likely not need another one for 5 to 10 years with the 5800X3D and 7900XTX Maybe even able to jump AM5 until the next one
Is that a 8GB card AI workloads is probably not common and probably very mem intensive for productivity people I hope there is cards you to people as well
You mind if I ask what software how many photos you re trying to process It might be something new for me to goof around with The biggest dataset I ve given my 6800XT 16GB in Metashape is about 250 DNG TIFFs it hasn t had any issues yet
Yeah can't play the latests games on that res But been able to after driver FSR but that still uses vram of the lower res But usually play games at 1440p and high texture quality but everything else on low Most recently Elden ring but that game was capped at 1440p 60 so it was decently easy to run outside some scenes
For me realistically I will not upgrade my monitor for a while so I'm just looking for 1440p If I do upgrade it will only be to a higher Hz monitor though People going for the 7600 7700 probably are the same
Well getting maxed out is not a problem does it cause stuttering or issues when full
Its technically graphics add in board as opposed to something like a wifi add in board or an audio add in board Daughter board expansion boards yo The modern lingo is just card Graphics card wifi card etc Yeah so reference cards are AIB's too that's why it doesn't make sense to me calling 3rd party vendors AIB's when 1st party is AIB too I feel like I'm missing something
We need some more blue in there to counter act it
air resistance so high at that speed
That's actually true lol Red has the fastest wavelength IIRC
Yes and green flames are slower
And yet they didn't change significantly if at all until the mid 2010s when multiple manufacturers were also caught price fixing Weird how that works
I surprisingly haven t had a BSOD in a long while But game crashes are semi frequent and turning off Windows 11 Game Mode doesn t help it Correction Not game crashes games tend to auto minimize Sometimes restarting the game works sometimes it doesn t
My RX 580 4gb was a problem child but it ended up being that my old psu wasn t giving stable power which was causing the driver to crash to black screen fans full speed Replaced psu with a higher quality one and that 580 is still going strong Have yet to get a BSOD with my 6700xt drivers have been really stable for me and stable on the rx 580 despite the psu power delivery issue My biggest issue rn is that some games love to auto minimize when launched I googled around and found that Windows game mode setting could be causing it turned it off but it still happens I can t take driver issue out of the possibilities but with how inconsistent this issue it I m leaning more toward game or Windows issue
Was that not the firmware stuff I remember having to wait a bit before I got th 5600XT for that to resolve it self
Can confirm I have a Sapphire HD5770 Beast of a card for it's time and price and is still running without issues on an older rig Ran a hd7970 up until recently as well and that card gave me 60fps on mid high in doom combined with my 1700 I'm very tempted to grab an rx76 700xt once these come out and run it with a 5800x3d which should run in my ab350m and not make my mobo explode lol
I ve had a 5700xt for 2 years with absolutely no issues First ever AMD card due to RTX scalpers grabbing all nvidia cards And I ll admit I had my reservations and fears about it but it s been surprisingly pretty good After the 40 series I m straying further away from nvidia and more towards AMD due to them having better cost performance ratios
I have one of every AMD GPU right now aside from the 6800 No black outs People are running into something else and blaming AMD I do this for a living and fix a lot of AMD issues by changing others things in the PC usually removing afterburner or putting a proper PSU in their system
I tried a view currently using a Corsair TX750M I assure you it is not a hardware issue I tested pretty much everything
Their online store isn't available to most of the
I didn t know they shipped to Sweden Sweet
Hello its me your best friend Jk im enjoying a brand new 5800x3d and a 3060ti i got last year after selling a 5600xt Ive enjoyed amd for a long time rdna 1 was very impressive at 1080p I recommend sapphire very premium cards
Yes but compared with a new flagship graphics card every two years
If someone told you your hobby is dumb because its expensive and unnecessary but they just spent several grand on pretentious car accessories are you not allowed to call it out Just because you're allowed to do something doesn't make it or you free from criticism Lego being expensive is a valid criticism lots of moderately nice sets are 100 minimum
That's what they claim to spend on a PC I'd just re use the sets to make new things
Considered building a NAS server to store documents in Building and running your own servers is really fun and it can be really cheap if you use some old parts mine has an FX 8320 and a GTX 1070 for transcoding and CUDA shit basically built it for free
I mean I am lmfao why else would I be here
How on earth did you manage to get it new for 300 below RRP Aside from which they bought it during the chip shortage on release when it was going for not far off double MSRP
Meanwhile here in eastern Europe the 3080 starts at 900 1000 euro 800 new right Similar price for the 6800 XT 800 1500 euro
One has reasonably cheap and reliably supplied GPUs the other has 3 for an entire country at scalper prices plus some untrustworthy resellers with a currency so devalued that nobody buys them anyway The UK is trying the live the balkan shithole economic experience at least Bit of a wake up even with their economy being too big to easily fail
How insecure are you that you think I'm upset because I don't understand why you're wasting your money
Of course you see a reduction from undersampling massively at lower resolutions but those cards have massive amounts of VRAM for a reason That stuff is expensive increases power draw significantly and not there for decoration As you start to go higher it begins to overtake the gains from lowering framebuffer resolutions and such
Economies of scale and got nvidia to blame for that Just redrill the alignment holes for AMD and slap on the same 3 4 slot coolers
Don't know what you mean by quality but if you mean cooling capacity the 6000 series was vastly improved compared to the blower style in the 5000 series as confirmed by GamerNexus The 7000 series reference design was also examined by GN and should see an even bigger improvement since fins are more densely packed and the opening is now bigger Gone are the days of crappy AMD reference designs Sapphires are obviously better since they take up a full 3 slots and extends past 267mm in length which some cases might not be able to accommodate
yeah I'm likely to buy the 7900xtx for that sweet 24gb along with processing power
In COD MW2 yeah although not sure if it's NVIDIA driver issue
blue is hotter than red though
We need more sapphire
thats the pro version
Don't you dare make logic from my flogic I won't stand for it so I will
Longest wavelength it's the lowest frequency one all other things being equal Blue has the highest frequency and energy
LOL
They they've gone up pretty steadily back since getting an 80 column card for your Apple was considered a graphics upgrade Yes there's been a few spikey years but it's been a pretty steady march upwards in the long run
Funny enough I occasionally and sporadically get the same windows minimize issue on my rtx 3070 pc but my 980ti pc never does it Both running windows 10 and latest Nvidia drivers I have yet to figure out what triggers
Really because all I remember was this sub being plastered non stop with crashes black screens and other critical issues for over a year after launch of RX 5000 just because you had a good experience doesn't mean it was a good card that didn't have massive widespread problems lol The world exists beyond the tip of your fingers
Whether they are running into something else doesn't matter If Nvidia is less likely to run into something else and is likelier to work and bypasses possible interreruptions that may be caused by many ''something else's'' then that means Nvidia has better drivers since they are likelier to succeed in working succesfully in a wider variety of scenarios I'm not saying that this is the case with Nvidia but you can't blame users for AMD being picky with which setups it works correctly with AMD makes graphics cards for open systems and Its mission has to be without question success of function regardless of variety If AMD is likelier to fail due to problems outside of the graphics card but that same interruption doesn't affect Nvidia then AMD is still the issue Either way ''if it crashes Its a GPU hardware issue on your end'' is impossible to say without proper analysis that statement is false
That's what about half of the people who come to me 't be coming to me if they had it all figured out I'm not perfect but I always figure it out
Man that Sapphire Pulse 5600 XT was a marvel of a card Dare I say greatest AIB card of all time Kinda mad at myself cause I bought an ASUS Dual OC
necessities I mean you could argue that the very practice of going out camping or fishing is not necessary and so anything and everything related to those activities is also unecessary It's not like you need to do it for food Hobbies are hobbies and most of them are complete money pits Let people enjoy their things
If I spent as many hours playing with legos as I do on my PC I'd absolutely spend more on Legos than building a flagship rig every 2 years There are very few hobbies that could entertain me for as many hours and as low of a price per hour as a gaming PC
I like LEGOs and computer hardware LEGO is absolutely more expensive than the latter
That sounds like another problem of the other party superiority complex and their opinion being allowed to have so much weight No one can tell you what to do with your time money You are free to do what you want You are also free to criticize be aware of consequences I straight up don t care as I have things that actually affect me to worry about Yes legos are hella expensive 100 gets you basic stuff First line at the Lego store has a 300 set and that s still relatively low cost I also realize Lego for example brings happiness and peace to some people Let them have that IMHO telling people to not be happy is pretty evil
That's what you'd do though some people like myself only like lego for the building part and aren't creative enough to build stuff on their own so you buy a set build it via instructions and shove it in a corner with all the others Though thankfully my car sucks up every single spare penny I have so I have no mony left to over spend on other hobbies Would really like to replace my 580 sometime soon
It does seem like something I'd be interested in for sure however I don't really have the need for it as of right now I only have about 1 5TB of files I need to transfer takes maybe 20 minutes Maybe in time I'll build one for shits n giggles beaming face with smiling eyes
My 1600X GTX 1060 build became my media server NAS during my last upgrade It s great having an actual PC interface instead of dealing with wonky TV apps controllers
Theres always a bigger enthusiast
Then why ask why You should understand there are some things that you wouldn't necessarily do but on the flip side would make another person's day or be an achieved goal If you're making a statement for yourself that is also fine But if you're questioning why someone else is doing something Their time their money their prerogative That's it My PC is my 3rd in two years Why Because I can and it all helps keep me sane happy Now I'm contemplating an Intel build
Msrp for the 10gb 3080 was 650 which at the time was around 560 I got one from an Nvidia drop at Scan UK
You also have to remember with mining being basically dead the secondary market has dried up heavily
Lol you need a geography lesson
Same in the UK really cheapest AIB I've seen is 740 for a Pallit The only ones for 650 were the rare FE drops at Scan which there don't seem to be any more of just overpriced Tis and 4090s
I wrote that before I found out you're a troll You're clearly upset enough to make like
Ovarall build quality materials cooling capacity time proof is quality for me
Except the rx 6700xt reference which still is meh
Yeah that 8gb can be maxed out easily with that type of workload as expected That's definitely not a knock on the 5700XT For gaming still a competent card for sure Max 1080p and pretty decent 1440p
The 24GB is def for workstation yeah
Drivers should be mature at this point might just be that the game is so resource intensive at the settings you run
's exactly what I'm saying everyone seems to use AIB to mean custom partner cards
Danny Devito is hotter than blue though
Why are you talking about things that have nothing to do with what I'm talking 499
Jeez I guess I got pretty lucky Edit you also have to think about the fact that AMD has to worry about their CPUs as well as GPUs while NVIDIA only has GPUs on top of AMD getting into the GPU game 10 11 years later than NVIDIA I definitely wouldn t expect them to be as good as NVIDIA just yet but they are certainly catching up
I can promise you the same issues that defect AMD cards affect Nvidia When you do this for a living for over a decade you see the patterns
It was incredible quietest card ive ever had and pumped frames at 1080p Got it for 280 before the shortage Sold for 550 Will always remember it
Preach
Depends on how often you buy Lego and and what Lego you get
To be fair you don't need a fresh flagship rig to get many many hours of gaming entertainment There is massive library backlog of games that work well on older hardware
I've never spent 1700 on a single Lego set
As someone who collected over a grand worth of lego as a kid I'd say a very small portion of adults have the means to store let alone buy everything they'd want with the current market Much more versatile uses of time money and space that make you more happy than some overpriced building blocks
That's a really sad thing to admit to other people out loud
1200MB sec transferspeeds are quite impressive for an external HDD
Just because you're willing to spend more money doesn't make you more of an enthusiast
Because it's nonsensical That's why I ask It is baffling behaviour
MSRP doesn't include the 20 VAT or import costs that get added to the price here 650 translates to at least 650 here depending on the strength of the pound at the time The cheapest I saw was about 800
Nah read the thread Op just misremembered how much it cost
Lol can you see the fucking prices in eu
You're calling me a troll and saying I'm upset because I and like 50 other people don't understand why you'd spend a couple of grand on nearly identical machines every couple of years Are you projecting or just stupid
Lol the newest Nvidia drivers instantly crash in CoD MW2 and people are forced to rollback drivers in order to play the game Also Nvidia cards perform like ass compared to AMD in MW2 the RX 6700xt gets more frames than my 3070 sad but relieved face
My point is if you put a line of best fit through all the data points going back to since GPUs started to be a thing you will find a steady line that outpaces inflation by a bit Yeah we get dips and peaks but the big picture view is a line that goes up Right now definitely a peak there will be a dip in next gen or the following but it will average out to a steady rise in prices We aren't insanely far off the trend
You don't buy an single LEGO set every two years and call it a hobby Also there's definitely LEGO sets at and way above 700
Which part of it Genuinely curious
rolling on the floor laughing Indeed Well it is not 20 minutes but a short amount enough of time it's not something I need to shorten further
I mean I am lmfao why else would I be here This can't be true if you can't relate or understand why someone would go through any lengths for the sake of enjoying something You don't have to understand it You only need to worry about what keeps you going and gives you what you are looking for I do hope you find enjoyment in those things Have you been to r MechanicalKeyboards
Apologies you are correct I forgot the tax the price I paid was 540 plus tax 650 Just checked the invoice
I'd presume that's the point of Lego
700 is less than half of what they're spending on a PC every single time and Lego can be dismantled and made into something new You have absolutely no creativity if you are buying new Lego sets every single time
The complete lack of creativity to arrange a set of blocks in an order of your own design
Welp you got me you know who I am and what I enjoy better than I do you arrogant twat
I don't see anything embarrasing about that I'm just not creative I'm not an artist I'm not a content creator I enjoy games that are story driven and made to be enjoyed instead of boneworks or garry's mod Creativity isn't something you 's like being embarrased about your looks personality or mental condition
That s a projection Not once did I attack you which takes arrogance or assume anything about you You did state fundamentally contradictory things though What I am going to assume is you didn t read the whole thing that s on you Correction I did make an assumption based on initial contradiction my bad
I don t know where you got that This whole thread started with your words to that effect the things other people do are baffling The whole point that you are missing is literally you do you Be well
Well you see I got that because I made the mistake of reading anything that you said
Are you BMW engineer
So how does it perform
My guy went crazy on the 7900 xtx's ass
I love this and hate this at the same time
Intresting how much
Run a dual DDC setup through that badboy
Holy pressure drop rolling on the floor laughing
Flow is like 1ml Also tubing can be heavily improved distribution column
Wow great job why not just one block per set of VRM's though would drastically lower the point of failure
How much head pressure must your pump have and would this actually perform well at all Now you've got me curious
Learn how you can spend RTX 4090 money on a 7900 XTX with this one simple trick

I don't know what I'm looking at exactly but I can say it looks cool
Ahh something unusual for a change Very nice Pls post results D
Forbidden noodles
what a frankenstein nerd face
Alright stop teasing us Show us some benchmarks please
Kill me
Please tell me the liquid you are using comes with a neon green glow
That's not fixing the reference cooler that's replacing the reference cooler The title is a lie That's a lot of tubing I feel your flow is going to be killed by those blocks but looks like a fun attempt let us know what the temps are like when you run it
What's wrong with your pet spider
Love it grinning face with smiling eyes
Can you do a hard tube version Or metal pipes this looks insane but u wanna be 100x insane with metal hard tubings
The first and second photos reminds me of when Ripley knocked off Ash's head in the 'Alien' film and then you could see all those white fibrous tendrils within Ash's neck sticking out
This is art
Please do post the results of this build too
would love to see a video on this if it's real that would be amazing
I've been looking for folks doing DIY water on XTX and you are the first need to really max out the power as well we need to find a way to unlimit the current also I love it it's mad
Fixed
LTT tried something similar once The problem ends up being that the water doesn't flow through some tubes because the others are much easier to flow through
2008 called It wants it's expert water cooling solution back But
Why have 4 points of failure when you can have 87 interlooping points of failure
There s no liquid in them so you basically swapped for the same thing
That's a weird waterblock
This is the best looking water cooling setup that I have seen in long time
Honestly I love this You could do a very industrial theme with this
So many points of failure here This will not end well I suspect
face with tears of joy brilliant
next I want you to show us OC result plzzz beaming face with smiling eyes
looks like the gpu ended up in an intensive care unit
This is beautiful
so this is what madness looks like haha
you would think spending 1000 on an inferior gpu would at least have quality going for it
That s an awful lot of unnecessary critical failure points flushed face
Lmao please tell me this is real and actually works Looks like a nightmare for the pump to get fluid through all those restrictions
So many potential leaks holy shit
Gotta say we have a 7900xt from sapphire at work and under a stress test with an open side panel it sits between 50 and 60 C with it's hotspot in the 70s They're great cards when they're not affected by the reference issue
Awesome For a time there in the early 2000s these mini loops were the rage With distro plates and everything I think MIPS made the first tiny blocks but not sure Always wanted one Quite envious of that setup
Hey First off absolutely LOVE what you have done here the effort and craftsmanship is fantastic BUT I have built something VERY similar to this as a hydroponics system and there's one issue I found that may plague you Unless you can put a faucet on every individual line and tune it to identical back pressure the water will take the path of lesser resistance and one of the 2 smaller tubing lines will get less flow and result in hotter chips But due to waters massive thermal conducting properties you may not see a difference and this may not affect you at all Incase you have one side of chips hotter than the other your solution would be to unplug the end of the thin lines and tune the water to drip at the same exact rate Best of luck please post updates and god dam what a cool af design
That is baller
You got some balls to do this good luck
This is pure insanity and I love every bit of it
All this effort to be outperformed by an AIB model on an air cooler Neat project though
You got some good photos of it mate keen to see the results D
What s the advantage of using like 21 heatsinks over 4 6 big ones It looks like this is pretty custom If not then I guess it makes sense but if you have the choice y would u do this This is gonna fail and leak and leak and fail sooo much
This is so amazingly jank Incredible
Alot of people saying this system will not work saying it will leak or it will be impossible due to restrictions So I cut into the build time to hook up the res's real quick on just 2 d5's to show how well the flow is on this system I'v done multiple gpu's like this with 0 issue's v K3xxVwuTnaw v K3xxVwuTnaw
I like it picasso
thats some engineering at its finest
I don t know why but i imagine you will do like the medic from tf2 t 2m56s
Main rig that this gpu is going in has not yet been completed Was supposed to be done a week ago but alot has changed in the build process that is taking much more longer Id say another week or 2 until build is ready to turn on Just ton of custom work is being done so its very time consuming Sorry about that wait a bit longer
This as an absolute disaster waiting to happen Looks cool as shit Terrible idea Just get a full coverage waterblock with proper fittings
The engineering is pretty incredible but your reasons for doing it are not This guy out here spending as much as a 4090 because AMD with Adrenaline softwere and FSR is better than a 4090 Even though a 4090 has FSR and DLSS and far better RT performance Like you've already spent the equivalent money of a 4090
Why
AMD you forgot an engineer to hire He is just there
Someone get this person a CNC They would be dangerous in a good way

So never mind the flow rates issues that could arise from this and the hundreds of points of failures how are you gonna cool the liquid after it has absorbed the heat Or are you relying on it to cool through the tubes or something thinking face
How are temps
instead of multiple small pieces you could have just got 5 units with custom sizes automotive mechanic inside me is screaming at this right now
I remember wanting to do something like this a few years ago But with type K cooper
From the thumbnail pic I thought you water cooled thru the vapor chamber tubing Any video of your card in action
I am scared but also mildly intrigued
What in the world How do you even mount this in a case
This should have a NSFW tag Daaaam
this is the opposite of that watercooling build someone recently posted that was only fittings with no tubes
k ace effort but the real question is if that that will last
Hope you modded the shunts haha
Just submerge entire mini pc into an immersion tank like what bitcoin miners have
perhaps I am missing something eg how much is the cost for all those wb is there any reason why you preferred this over a solution like a waterblock from EK
that card is 1 tube away from being sentinent being XD
How dare you no post temps face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy But pretty cool looking See what I did there face with tears of joy
ocd will not let me use this I would be way to afraid of a leak I am sure it won't but nah my anxiety would be pinged
Reminds me of the GPU from Miles Morales
A tiny bit extreme but ok
Seems like a large distribution plate would have been easier and less leak prone Good work though I'm reminded of Orac 3
Can you explain the tubing I'm wondering why you don't just feed into a bank of minis and go through the minis along the bank and instead came up with whatever this is I guess what im asking is can you make a tubing diagram and explain the flow of coolant through this
Matrix looking mf er
Magnificent I thought for a second it was direct die I guess that could be for another time
remind me 14 days
Nice one
I am very curious to the temperature at the inlet and each section's outlets Like how much does the GPU vs memory vs VRM temp change
Was this only an issue on the reference cards manufactured by AMD I have a reference model from Sapphire Haven t seen any major temp issues But I don t really have a 4K display to tax it yet
The nuclear option
What is the Frankensteins titties is this I love it
who needs to bleed the system amirite
this is actually insanely cool
looks neat is it much different from a single alu block seems like a lot more work and maintenance for likely 0 difference in performance
Final Boss of wc'ing lol I hope that gets fed with two loops
remindme 10 days
You did a fantastic job It s amazing what some of the people in this sub are capable of creating That said I feel it really speaks to the sad state of affairs that is the 70 series card And a reference card at that
Just from a flow perspective you'd be much better off making 3 long blocks for the memory and then 2 blocks instead of all those little blocks for the VRMs
It's plugged into the Matrix
The unneeded complexity beautiful
Does anyone no if the 7900XTs are also affected I haven t seen anything about them and I have one

Please explain what I'm looking at lol
one of those will give out
for a second I had to double check what subreddit I m in cuz I thought I was in the bmw subreddit skullface with tears of joy cuz of the comment section
Now i have seen all
Send this to Steve and Linus
Is the OP derbauer
Wow thats slightly overkill I would probably try to connect small blocks I think there might be some small issues with temps here too I think first small block will be much cooler than last one
that doesn't look fixed to me
So many failure points this stresses me out but also gives me a lil chub
That's an expensive fix
I did something similar to cool a raid controller Just be sure the smaller tubing doesn't leach plasticizers into the loop Those small tubes seem to not kink under a short bend radius which means they contain some degree of plasticizer Under high temperatures those can leech into the water and can discolor or clog other parts of the loop
Hardtubing seems like a fun way to spend your time on this
Why are the tubes set up in such a complicated array lol I don't know what I'm looking at
Interesting fix
Jokes on you I just dipped the entire card into a tub of dielectric fluid and pointed a desk fan at it
how do you stick the small blocks to the board What intel LGA plate have you used u psychoOC
It's just that
this is both dumb and amazing at the same time nice work i cant wait to see the results
AMD deserves optics like this I'm pretty skeptical they've gotten to the root of the problem
u think melting the tubes onto the fittings might give u a good seal
What are the number of steps taken in each sequence of tubing before hot water leaves this system Don't mean to sound pessimistic but it looks like using sequenced loops like this will just cycle hot water through any tubing past the first VRM Don't know enough about the output of the VRMs or these components to really do any math but I'd take an educated guess that the 3rd VRM in a sequence won't be cooled at all Looks cool though
Do you need to cool the gray things On my GPU there are thermal pad on them that touch the heat sink
Or you can just rma it for free man shrugging
Dozens of hours of work for mild gains Nice
Its like something you would see in mad max how much turbo you got there grinning squinting face
This is simultaneously the best and worst thing ever
What am I looking at Are those 24 little waterblocks 1 gpu waterblock If so isn't that highly restrictive
still thinner than a 4090
Looks like it's on life support
remindme 14 days
This is now my spirit animal
reference card Don t see much left of the reference cooler haha Mighty impressive either way
I hope this is ran parallel to the main tubing or else it's gonna be a major resistance point lol
so now its like a 5 slot card
Zip tie your fittings It's like compression fittings came out in people for completely forgot how do water cooling
wow
wouldnt the last die in the loop be essentially cooled with hot water
Um could have save you like 3 hrs of bs and bought a full cover waterblock lol probably much better temps too
temps under full load Superposition 8K
Superposition 8k max temps now
I fixed by sending this gpu back where is came from never again buy amd products worst experience ever
Got my first bmw earlier this year and this comment hits so close to home I ve never seen so much plastic tubing in my life
Are you BMW engineer Yes You'll need a subscription to cool your GPU
Needs more subscriptions
It has plastic water pump impellers so it checks out
Everything you need to know about BMW's is right there in the German language x200B For instance they have no word for convenient Ponder that shit at you know
Told my lady friend I'd replace her BMW headlamp 000 000 curse words
Lmfao
Bahaha
As a European car Tech this made me chuckle
I didn't see any turn signals so it's possible
Its really too bad how much of a niche joke this is which is kinda depressing because its hilarious You need an award but I have no money on account of trying to keep a BMW and AMD computer working
i would be too stressed out knowing that 1 1000 of those barbed fittings could pop off at any second at least ziptie them on
In a week or 2 im posting results So far i dry tested it to make sure nothing shorted it pass
Dude has ALL the chill
110 for cpu block 5 each for the mini blocks 25 blocks in total 125 for mini s
Ddc would be ideal but atm the rig its being hooked up to is 5 d5 s with over 1 gallon res 3ft above the first dual d5 top So plenty of pressure and flow i hope haha
This will be in my head all day now
I think OP has multiple pumps
Agreed but this is the best i could think of This gpu is extremely sensitive to temps change so im making sure everything gets overkill cooling
Agreed But they dont make extended mini s so i went overboard since im trying to soak all of the pcb s heat through the vrms This gpu is very temperature sensitive
Water has a ridiculously high specific heat capacity so flow rate doesn't matter this much Heat transfer happens until there is no more thermal gradient a point that is unlikely to be reached because you need to dump 4x 11x more Joules of energy into a defined mass of water to have it increase 1 C in temperature compared to the same mass of metal or silicon
Free flowing manifolds Dont need much flow to get the full loop going
That could be said about most custom loops on any hardware but the fastest
Haha true But same time its a 4090 killer with fsr in the games i play that dont have dlss so its my only option fsr not natively supported games
No enthusiast would ever say something like this That's like seeing someone's built car and saying they should have bought a Corvette Also op said it was only 225 so you're wrong
Epoxy so its 100 permanent
he custom watercooling his gpu
Black light glow orange or green but you already know whats up 2008 gang
Shouldn t effect flow They are free flowing manifolds and the loop is isolated for inlet and outlet dedicated only Plus 5 d5 s at 100 should ignore any restriction
That's no spider that's a replicator
Video and screenshots link pics will be posted in a weeks time when main rig is finished I still got alot of work to do on main rig
Yeah the gpu cooling is built to handle 600watts daily Anything past that the hotspot will dip in 90 s crashing This gpu very much dislikes 90 hotspot Gpu will be taken apart again in a month from now for volt modding
Haha exactly what year i went for A finished legit 2008
Haaaa that was good haha
That s a weird waterblock

Not a fan of current gpu waterblocks They are very 2003 fin density and overall performs terribly compared what it could be The block of choice im using is optimus intel cpu block
Thank you
The rig its hooking up to is very old school and industrial late 90 s vibe youl love it
Indeed So beautiful right
Its very real Done this to my 6900xt aswell Wait a week for full build oc results
Agreed some loops will get favored I tried to even out each loop by its line length and block count Only 1 loop connects to the other side so when testing its going to be interesting which loop gets favored My past gpu was done like this but the manifolds did a cross over so flow heavily favored them This time its pure dependent on flow its self i think since they are going parallel with the mains
Gpu is getting volt modded Everything is getting by passed
I'v done multiple gpu's like this they all pass with flying colors no issue's and beat full cover waterblocks in temps
Thanks for the update
Any updates
Yeah there's a reason most water blocks generally have as few cooling surfaces as they can get away with when you have too many tubes and plates fluid dynamics and path of least resistance starts coming into play and some areas start getting less flow than others It also adds more pressure to the water and with the number of potential failure points here it's asking for trouble

They mentioned in another comment but they're got like five 360GTRs with push pull fans or something similarly wild
In 1 or 2 weeks ill see Iv done this before to a 6900xt and the results were very good
Case of choice is inverted its upside down so underbelly is in full view
Its being volt modded Everything is getting bypassed
You can drive an 18 wheeler through ek s fin density While on this its using optimus intel cpu block fin density is very intense Will pull the heat much faster than a normal block
Magnificent I thought for a second it was direct die I guess that could be for another time It is direct die it's a graphics card Most cards haven't used heatspreaders on the GPU die for like a decade Even the stock air cooler or any third party waterblock is direct die
No the chokes don't need any cooling
Would be a alot worse in temps All modern day gpu full cover blocks have terrible fin density and no actual concentrated vram cooling More of 15 hours of work on this gpu alone Another 15 20 for hard mods soon
I elected to change spark plugs and head gasket on an 08 335i I had awhile back I don t know how those engineers fit all that shit in there but I will never work on a bmw again Fuck that
There are 2 days that make a BMW owner happy The day they buy one and the day they sell it to another sucker
replace all them with aluminum parts it s costly but will save you money in the long run
My cousin started working on one as a project car I've never so depressed during the
Wait It is earlier this year Congratulations on your new car
I remember when BMW used air hoses and pumps for power windows instead of a simple motor mechanism like everyone else Also BMW is notorious for using plastic in critical areas subject to higher environmental loads and of course would fail 72 hours post lease expiration Look at the depreciation curves The M5 V10 NA models were fun drives but of course the dreaded VANOS issues etc lol Although I think that line will become collectors vehicles in the future
Everything you need to know about BMW's is right there in the German language For instance they have no word for convenient Ponder that shit at you know german word for convenient is ''praktisch'' is google not free in what i can only assume is USA
No OP probably
Where did you find those small vrm memory blocks I have like 5 of them but need several more for some similar projects and I absolutely cannot find them anywhere for sale except for Europe with a stupidly high shipping fee

OP It's been 2 weeks results or did I miss them
Alright it's been 2 weeks and I'm very intrigued What are the results
So how about now 2 weeks have gone by
remindme 14 days
So where results
Where did you get the small ones I have some project ideas now that I know these exist D
About as much as a block would be if any company had bothered to release one for the reference design
Jesus christ here I am thinking it is ridiculous when here it is way cheaper than the ek block I'm going to get lol
So 've waited a few weeks
Yeah that will be fine definitely post up when it's running
Is the loop sealed Because if it is the height of the reservoir is irrelevant
Mine too now I'm glad this is what was on the other end of that link because that's also what popped into my head immediately
It's still a lot of choke points and a lot of points of failure If any of them go bad it'll be a pain in the ass to deal with over a single larger tube or three feeding one block
But why not a single longer block instead of like 10 in a straight row with tubes That really has to whisper l absolutely kill your flow rate
Uh in having benched a lot surprisingly no It's just extremely extremely power limited Running my card deshrouded with phanteks t30s at 3000rpm and liquid metaled I only gained about 200pts in port royal Power limits are really fucking lame without MPT
What you did doesn't look overkill it looks extremely inefficient
Usually the mem chips are 1 2w and vrm loss 20w if you're not pushing mem clocks or board power it's nice to have them water cooled with full water block but normal heatsink and fan would of worked Looking at my 1080ti 300w full water block is kinda wasted
You can try solid drilled through copper blocks immersed into flowing water as a coolant
Would be nice to have a parts list you used and from where to buy I think this is something I would like to try myself
Does this just mean that each of the GDDR ICs have no fins inside the blocks
Which is why I never water cool My friend bought a Strix 3090 last gen to water cool it ended up being completed just as the 3090 ti arrived but cost so much more overall I just sold my 3090 and bought a 3090 ti instead More power less headaches But also worth noting that I was really just making a joke
You know that 4090 can use FSR too
Can't the 4090 use FSR
I m glad you enjoyed doing all this but that s just cope
Don't worry I was just trolling I couldn't resist It does look really cool
Why are you so oddly salty I posted my comment before OP gave a price although 225 is not cheap Also a car is not the same you drive and experience that car and cars have a very specific feel A GPU on the other hand gets tucked away in a case and is experienced through a monitor so all that matters is the performance through that screen You won't feel some special nuances like you would in a tuned muscle car Vs a stock sports car All he gets is much less RT no DLSS no DLSS3 which IMO is a game changer and future maintenance issues all for maybe 200 300 less than an RTX 4090 It looks like a fun project but for most people it definitely would not be worth the cost or effort
well no turning back now but it looks really cool
Username checks out
I usually glue small coolers with superglue cyanoacrylate That forms a very thin film for good heat transfer epoxy is not so good at that and can be removed if necessary by dripping a bit of acetone between chip and cooler
I got the green glow under my car zany face
5 d5s Why so many Now you have me curious what the rest of your setup is haha
Indeed
Holy moly 600 watts through a card is bonkers
Yeah don't listen to all these negative nincompoops criticizing you for one reason or another I'll bet 90 haven't even tried something this fun or bold much less have the guts to post it to this or another subreddit It's mostly their inner inadequacy trying to take you down a notch to justify their lack of action and creativity I'm envious of what you've done here and wish I had the time motivation to do the same Look forward to seeing the temp results PLEASE consider doing a video as well even if you just post it to a shared Google drive instead of YT for limited sharing I'd be happy to help if needed I have some basic experience with a Davinci and Premiere
Can you post a full rig picture Edit I just found where you posted it That is such a unique build I love it
you planning on using a EVC Is there any documentation yet on anyone doing this or doing any power modding volt modding to get desired increases
Testing dye its mix of dp ultra orange so i can see flow better But the finish liquid will be uv orange As long as its transparent it will not effect temps and using mixed fluids has bit of antifreeze to kill all growth also no corrosion so mixing aluminum and brass copper nickle wont do squat
Can you share the 6900XT results I have that with half ulgy byski water block on Sapphire 6900XT Nitro SE
i see let's say that ek is more for average modder and this solution is for performance without compromise now it makes sense thanks
Well I can say those super thin non copper blocks will Not outperform a waterblock because the fin density isn t what correlates to better cooling it s radiator surface area All metals absorb heat or cold for the most part fins and the arrays can help a bit depending on design for the gpu core but I mean there s no fins for memory and the blocks still transfer heat to liquid correct Also those mini blocks have zero fins so I m not exactly sure how your applying the science here I m not breaking balls either I just happen to be highly experienced in Heat transfer fluid systems Kind of my thing If you really wanted to make something amazing I would take a block and have it machines in the areas where the chips hit use fin based heat sinks for each and have them fit the block because the area that hits the liquid would or should be the same as the chips for memory and VRM then have the block area shaved in order to come closer to the fins of the mem chips which should draw heat better into the base of the block for better liquid heat absorption I mean 15 20hrs that s a lot of time I would personally put a waterblock on it in 22 minutes and be done Here is the reason why you won t even be able to mitigate the voltage if you unlocked it in bios by conventional liquid cooling hence LN2 OCing so you can only do so much on either side of the table That system you have has way too many failure points and those rubber tubes become malleable under heat even slight and could easily leak at like 90 different spots Unless you use clamps but even so is all that really making a difference on temps and OC that drastically because AMD gpus are terrible at memory OC as well nothing like Nvidia just seems pointless unless you did it for fun I can get down on the fun part lol
God I hate love but mostly hate that N54 engine
Try changing the indicator light bulb on a mercedes You have to hitch the car remove the front wheel remove the covering under the wheel arch and then practice some yoga while you reach into the headlight assembly to replace the bulb Once you've successfully completed the procedure don't forget the mandatory tetanus jab as you've undoubtedly cut yourself multiple times
That engine is worth a decent amount of money A lot of enthusiasts have realized that engine can produce an absurd amount of power with only a few aftermarket changes so it s become very popular and highly sought after
I had a 2009 135i those engines bays are a nightmare of wires I have a Challenger Hellcat today and the simplicity of the engine makes the engine bay so damn clean There is a reason most cars have massive plastic engine covers it s to hide the afterthought of the layout of wire and accessory plumbing

There's no water block for the reference design
There's definitely something to be said about quality of life features like not having to deal with 52 hose fittings though
Buying pre built is great all the hard work has been done for you but this dude really likes DIY He's done this before with a 6900xt and judging from his post history spending the money on his own project seems to bring him more joy But maybe I'm wrong and he just has a kinky tube fetish It's reddit I wouldn't be surprised
Not quite right it should still be at the top of the loop to collect air and it can't be too far up or you won't be able to bleed it properly because you won't have the head for it
I could run a marathon without training if there was a 6 hour loop of that song the beat is so good
Hey at least it'll be upside down should make blocks with barb covers and housings to drip down if a lake occurs nd yu can put litmus paper with a bit of baking soda on it to test underneath the GPU
Hi Equipment tech here This is a really cool thing I feel like someone at least ought to remind you to be really vigilant about leaks in this thing They're absolutely inevitable and I don't mean that as a slight If they're in series like that the first clog anywhere is going to pop a tube upstream If it never clogs that's awesome You should be aware that the tubing will EVENTUALLY harden and learn the shape of those barbs At that point nothing short of a full tubing replacement will prevent leaks If I'm you I'm replacing all of this tubing yearly at a minimum But maybe you're not even here for that long what do I know This is a really cool thing Good job
I know nothing about cooling but If you put a single block is it possible that the block doesnt tuch uniformly
Not if you stack them in parallel Then it s number of blocks flowrate for one block flowrate of main 3 4 5 8 tubing Everyone s favorite inequalities
There's gonna be so many flow dead zones in there
Why would they The thickness and size of the blocks themselves requires no fins that would cause even further impedance to the flow I would have gone with larger rectangular blocks with thermal pads on the memories personally
Power output on those parts is so low they don't need a fancy block
It can but in games that dont have fsr in settings amd adrenaline comes in handy can force fsr Yes nvidia can do the same with 3rd party steam software but we found its not the same and nvidia side snags more issues with ghosting for Reason Games i play and vr games all dont have fsr native support or dlss So 7900xtx is the only choice for me
Yes
Shh
1000 225 1225 fyi It's just a lame attitude people like op make the PC space more interesting Nobody does custom water cooling for value and pointing out that it's impractical adds nothing because everyone already knows that The fun is in tinkering and building something cool and unique
Thanks Im stoked how it turned out
Hehe pics will be posted in time so far atm its 5 gtr s 360mm rads push pull 1800rpm wide open p12 s 1 7gallon res Its juicy Cpu of choice is heading stright for 7950x3d Atm the 7700x is the test cpu
Thank you jamkey i will do a video on first pressure testing so everyone can see flow is pretty fast in a setup like this You will enjoy the rig and results very much
Yeah evc2 No one has done it yet Waiting for my boy to get some data and we begin
I have the straight six M54 and don t really understand these comments but then again I got lucky with one of the best model years 2002 e39 manual with plenty of space in the engine bay P I ve heard the engines that came after that year were pretty bad though
N14 for Loved the mini but Lord that thing broke a lot Even the high pressure fuel went out I finally gave up on it
luckily you won't have that issue with a BMW The car will go to the graveyard before these are used even a single time

Not yet
And in this case the block is probably reusable so cost goes down with each generation of GPUs
Didn't claim otherwise If you enjoy frankensteining your own cooling you should totally do it If I had q cnc I'd probably build coolers as a hobby face with tears of joy
Yeah that's it res above not too far and in sealed conditions head pressure should be a non issue
Doesn't need to be at the top of the loop just before and preferably above the pump It doesn't make difference to head pressure and flow so long as the loop is sealed which is more specifically what I was talking about See the comment I was replying to for context
Solution Build a funnel and tube system below the GPU that collects any leaks and safely tubes it out of the PC case
Yes but VRMs and memory modules are way lower power which is why they only need to have a 0 5 2 0mm thick squishy thermal pads and low pressure contact to a waterblock heatsink vs the GPU die which uses extremely thin thermal paste and higher pressure contact Using 1x big GPU water block 24x tiny component water blocks is a bad idea for a lot of reasons Tons of failure points horrible flowrate or a ton of pumps needed for proper flowrate and it also looks like a bitch to connect and setup properly splits into 2 paths after running over the microfins directly over the extremely hot GPU die flows over the rest of the hot components and meets up right next to the single intake flow path They don't need to copy this design at all but it would have been better to have 5x long skinny waterblock for the memory components and 1x large one for the GPU die The baby blocks need 2x tubes in out each and the long block would have in out at opposite ends allowing for thicker tubing better flowrate and 1 3 the total tubes in the picture Another option is just putting on some sticky thermalpad backed copper heatsinks on everything hot and slapping on 1x fan over the board
That's why on cpus and gpus you use screws The small parts usually don't and just use pads squeezed between de cooler and die If you use a thick enough pad it should be fine
I don't really know why was just asking for understanding I would have also gone with longer blocks to cover each of the strips of ICs
Ok but why would you NEED FSR1 0 when you have a 4090 You'll have more than enough raster frames for anything NVIDIA has NIS which is bascially the same as FSR 1 pass vs 2 does that you can use the control panel for Its driver level so you can enable it on any game I think you've been using AMD for so long you don't realize that NVIDIA has the same options even without support options There is no 3rd party software
How are finding VR performance on the 7900XTX Everything I've heard is that it gets obliterated to the point that people suspect driver issues
You do know you can force FSR through any VR game using OpenXR Toolkit
i can immagine this in future updated to hard tubing in clear PVC cyberpunk AF
Sounds like it needs a big case or have you got it externally I have an o11d XL with 3 360 rads couldn't fit anymore haha Currently only have it running for the CPU block as I haven't bought a block for the 4090 I picked up recently the FE cooler isn't bad surprisingly
Delidded
yea seems like someone on OCN is gonna try but they are waiting for block since ek got delayed
That is a big worry is them little blocks but these little blocks are pretty hardy As long as i dont use pastel fluids its pretty smooth sailing from there
The m54 is the naturally aspirated predecessor to the n54 5 and is waaaay more reliable I got one with 157k mi and another with 198k e46s and both run super strong Just watch out for the plastic cooling systems E39 is a dope timeless car
The M54 was probably the last I6 by BMW that's actually easy to work on and still decently reliable The M54 still has tons of plastic components in the cooling system that like to leak and it is prone to catastrophic damage when overheated but it is still much better than the I6 engines after it Many of the engines following the M54 use electric water pumps that like to fail which requires even more plastic fittings that also fail and some include turbos with lots of different ways to leak and break It is pretty easy to make drastically more power with the N54
Cries in m40b18is
The best thing about the BMW Mini is buying several of them from a scrapyard fixing up one of them and then just treating it like a go kart If it breaks down you either fix it using parts from the others or you use it for target practice
Should I be grateful for driving a 90s mustang It's literally 2 pins holding the headlights onto the body Pop the hood pull the pins unplug the bulbs
Eh that s not a bad deal for the time There was no way of knowing what would happen I don t think anyone had pandemic on their bingo card for this decade

Do you mean available or planned at all Because EKWB does have one But will only ship end of January
I've got some cnc machines if you want to go into business send me a pm
I guess it comes down to if you're operating in theory or in practice and if you're looking at whole room height or just within a case My setup is weird so I run into edge cases
Tubing clamps will probably make some difference but I'm unsure what exactly they'll do In the short term I'd bet more on them causing an issue than solving one The issue is in the fact that elastic tubing elastic anything has memory and eventually that'll mean that the shape of the tubing is the same as the shape of the barbs and that leaves nothing to hold the seal In that case clamping can help but then you run into the same problem from the beginning I forgot to mention what that is Ladder clamps and zip ties have the same problem here that's inconsistent sealing pressure Where the closure happens they don't press straight down they press inwards This can cause a gap in the seal they make and cause a leak It'll depend on the specific setup for whether or not it's solving a problem or causing a problem the angle here where the closure happens is what I'm talking about you can't get a zip tie or lots of things to make an actual circle there's always a bump auto webp s f530922bea40462531d0d13dfa8f04b93125a631 They make plastic clamps that you squeeze the sides of and they cinch into almost consistent seals but still only almost The elasticity of new tubing is generally going to be the strongest option At the end of the day the right PM is tubing replacement imo Any way you slice it this is a custom job and you're going to get custom results out of it for better or worse
Leaks should be really small You could get away with just employing someone to stand around and blow on it all day for evaporation probably
They mean different component heights as the single water block has different surfaces CNCd
Yeah the guy is on a super hard copium trip it seems Extremely overkill cooling solution on a card he really should have just RMAed or returned and all because of a convoluted idea of why a 7900XTX with FSR is somehow superior to a 4090 with DLSS all while spending basically the same amount of money a 4090 costs
It highly depends on the situation Sometimes its worse than my heavily overclocked 6900xt and sometimes in vrchat it becomes a god I cant locate the reason why it sways so hard in vr just yet Im using vive pro2 so the encoder shouldnt matter as the q2 guys are up in arms about But i really think its a driver issue aswell
Nice setup 4 rads are external while 1 is inside case I forgot the case name its a be quiet inverted case tho
They putting on a ek block ehhh results going to get bit muddy since this gpu has a very spicy hotspot
Just pray your alternator doesn't shit the bed and you end up with antifreeze and motor oil all over the pavement
N54 is reliable its everything connected to it that isn't lol N55 is alright but not as good as the M54 B58 is really good like seriously good and reliable enough they put it in a car with toyota badges
And that is exactly how I treated that car lol Like a big go kart because no matter what you did you knew it was going to break In the end I had it running on 22lbs of boost
On my Nissan I just reach in and twist the plastic bulb socket Rear lights are a different can of worms entirely
I wish I was in a position to have kept that car Such a great car aside from working on it Now that I have an actual job and am in a position to afford a project car I miss it every day lol What are people buying now aside from that one

all while spending basically the same amount of money a 4090 costs And anyone that has water cooled PC parts will know just by looking at that monstrosity that it's not a question of will it leak but rather when I'm all for doing cool stuff but there is a reason somethings are just not done
I wish companies specifically AMD and Apple would just be like we are going to take a pause from this incremental upgrade craziness for 1 2 years and we are going to spend all that money on improving drivers software Is that too much to ask I feel like their business models stock price would explode if they weren t constantly pushing the next slight iteration of their product onto consumers
There's results in another thread for the alphacool block 37c water 40c GPU 60c hotspot So should be plenty of headroom with bit cooler water Ek blocks are fine
Just replaced an alternator lool
Toyota failed Bmw's quality control hundreds of times before excepting the results
Yeah I would not make a BMW my project car lol They are a gigantic asshole to work on I remember replacing the valve cover on my 328 It was an absolute obnoxious endeavor because I had a pre LCI body with an N52N which was an upgraded N52 with the shitty plastic valve cover with the integrated crank case breather valve that gets clogged up after 70K miles if you do the manufacturer recommended oil change interval instead of a shorter one I got the Bentley manual cause I couldn t find the fucking torque specs anywhere for this specific variation of the engine at the time I still have that car It s my backup and it costs next to nothing for liability only insurance lol
I'm sure BMW will be happy to help them for a nominal monthly fee
Oh you're an idiot got it

Aquarium or exterior silicone should work or plumbers tape since that stuff swells to fill gaps when it contacts moisture
Just like PC games VR games also depends VR chat is optimized more than other games though because its more popular and has more support Its always a driver software combo rather than pure drivers but in the end we as consumers don't care because the outcome is the outcome Blaming the game or the driver doesn't really help but we know that AMD has a track record of driver issues that takes months or years to fix specifically for VR

Typical ASUS is typical 1 releases 700 board with ultra premium features including dedicated hardware controller 2 uses none of those features 3 only pays one intern to update BIOSes on the support website pushing out things that should not have been released 4 when things go south put worthless disclaimers written by lawyers on the support websites 5 Keeps head down until storm has blown over 5 profit
Also from the GN youtube channel Our 'Scumbag ASUS' video is up not relating to the Ally We want to note also that ASUS emailed us last week after Part 1 of exploding CPUs an unprompted email and asked if they could fly out to our office this week to meet with us about the issues and speak openly We told them we'd be down for it but that we'd have to record the conversation They did say they wanted to speak openly after all They haven't replied to us for 5 days S sure but we're filming it because we want a record of what's promised we get silence Wanting to comment on something and provide a statement is not only fine but encouraged we're always happy to provide that opportunity See Newegg interview with the executives However we're not going to let it be done without accountability and in the shadows They could have done this the right way
Support them everyone We need more youtubers like them that call out the companies for their mistakes and of they don't take them down
No more ASUS manufactured products for me
I miss Abit and DFI They made the last real enthusiast boards IMHO DFI is still in business but they are only making industrial products today
I m kind of impressed how much of a circus this has become It s insane how all these companies mobo manufacturer and AMD are marketing products with certain performance metrics while saying doing this will void your warranty It s how we got to where we are and it has to change
I had an asus tuf mb it had 5 year warranty plastered on the box i tried to claim because of an issue and it turns out my region doesn't have 5 i guess should've read the fine print but theyre selling this box with the big ass 5 year warranty image here too
Been building PCs for fifteen years this was my first time getting an ASUS board ever for my 7800x3d build Never again
Damn I just bought one enraged face
ASUS screwed me about 15 years ago and I'll never forget it or buy ASUS again I bought a motherboard that went out about 6 weeks later and I sent it in twice supposedly they gave me a replacement the second time I sent it in I had suspected they sent me back the one since I had the same exact issue and had worked out that my other hardware was fine with an extra motherboard from my work so I marked it with a sharpie with a small red dot and lo and behold the second time I got my replacement it came back with the same red dot I called them on it and they kept assuring me it was a replacement until I elevated it Even then I think the woman who helped me didn't believe me but just agreed to shut me up I finally got someone up the food chain and they wanted me to send it back in attention somebody or another Like how can I confuse where I wrote on it with a sharpie Its there on the replacement that's a load of crap So I send it back in and it takes them THREE months to send it back to me Meanwhile with the first two times I sent it in this was almost 6 months I was without my computer The one they sent me the 3rd time did work but it was clearly a refurb it was all used looking I think I deserved a new one after that Anyway I never used ASUS again which was to their detriment because I am an I T guy and have built at least 1000 computers since then and not one of them used ASUS I will never forgive you asus
I'm at a point in live where I consider not giving my money to the really scummy brands shout out to Activision Blizzard I know it does close to nothing for them but i do it for myself I bought Asus motherboards for over 2 decades the one with the nforce2 chipset was my first I was considering buying the new handheld feom Asus instead of the steam deck but even without reviews on performance this is already enough to choose the steamdeck Thats it for asus for the next years
I wish EVGA would make AMD boards
As someone who has been a loyal ASUS customer for over 25 years I gotta say I'm really disappointed how they're handling this Why even post BIOS updates at all if you're labeling them beta and displaying a warning that it won't be covered by warranty Sitting here with x670e e 7800x3d 6000Mhz DDR5 still patiently to config my BIOS with the correct memory settings I feel like I bought a Ferrari that's stuck in valet mode bit of an exaggeration but that's just how I'm feeling right now Please ASUS work together with AMD to fix this issue so that I can utilize the advertised features of my 500 motherboard
Asus lost my business from here forward This X670E TUF that I'm stuck with will be the last time they get my money for quite a long time I genuinely wonder what the lifespan of my 7700x is going to be like I saw well over 1 4v soc when I was doing my initial out of the box tuning and even after a 32 PBO offset I still saw well over 1 35 until I flashed bios once I became aware of this happening As someone who just switched from exclusively intel nvidia to full amd this is putting a pretty sour taste in my mouth At least when I was getting ripped off by intel and nvidia the parts actually worked for longer than they'd even be relevant for sigh
This sub did a full circle from looks like an asus issue to lol stupid redditors it wasnt asus to oh it was actually an asus thing
Scumbaggery is defiantly the case by ASUS and fair play to the Steve the GN team for calling them out on 's shithousery of the finest here by ASUS So glad I never even opened my ROG Strix X670E F and happily exchanged it for an MSI C 'm totally done with ASUS
You know what I'm fine with reviewers no longer reviewing Asus and AMD combo without EXPO because warranty isn't covered GN tried their best to not get warranty on an Intel platform but got warranty anyway
t 645 Asrock catching strays
As a long time Asus Guy massive L for Asus They lost me with this one And to have the balls to tell people a beta bios voids your warranty when you're trying to keep you're PC from melting itself down is unreal
ASUS motherboards haven't been made by Asus or Pegatron for years AFAIK They've moved to ECS since 2012
Whelp I guess I've bought my last ASUS product Have been buying them almost exclusively up until now
Damn l hope my 7 7700 CPU and B650E I MOBO doesn't fry
GN going full ballistic with ASUS today
Brand credibility headshot Based on past experience I've been buying Asus on the assumption that they had a decent level of quality and support What's a good alternative brand
So asus bios inclusive beta 1410 are still trying to kill our chips Nice Wtf are this guys doing
Jayztwocents also posted a Asus related video today too Lmao
Why wasn't this posted on the ASUS board
Steve really needs to get an editor for these video scripts I get the point he's trying to make by half way through each sub segment and then he's just repeating himself Love the videos and topics love the channel videos could be 30 50 shorter
Asus CEO and the executives should be all fired for allowing this to happen Asus had a better brand than msi and Gigabyte in general but this has brought them lower or at the same level Who is going to pay the Asus tax at this point going forward If you are one who have this problem take them to small claims one by one they will learn not to f with people They would need to hire a lotbof lawyers all over the world just to fight all these individual cases
Their GPU is overpriced as fuck too
Next board will be MSI probably but at least it wont be an Asus board they try chicken out warranty more then anyone and the worst way possible they basically just charge you price of a new piece of hardware 20 on top of the price for something that could be fixed for 25 euros even if the original fault is their own like reverse soldered input filtering capacitor etc They bassicly only care about money most others do as well and chicken out of warranty first chance they get but Asus is literally the worst
Are the benchmarks comparing EXPO vs manually set 6000cl30 what the sticks are rated for Or is it EXPO timings vs JDEC timings aka stock 4800 MHz If it's the former then I'm fucked because I manually tuned mine and I'm past return date for my Asus
scumbag is correct way to say Fxk Your very very stupidly expensive motherboard but you not even run test properly that your advertise as eXtREEmE motherboard
me who got a b650e e e from 't explode
Ha I m on 1413 bios so long suckers I m saved Jk at this point I just accepted that I have a schroedingers parts situation in my rig
Asus motherboard features probably all driven by marketing department to wow you with feature bullet points Testing is done by skeleton crew and hastily released
Is this the video they were teasing to release 1 2 weeks ago Why is it just now coming out
ASUS is spearheading the best marketing campaign Intel has had in years Killed me GN do come out with some great onliners
Using the MSI x670e Ace board with my 7950x3D and working great I do have the ASUS 4090 TUF OC and that's been running perfectly so it's disappointing to see how the company is handling this
I was a lifelong MSI mb guy and only got this POS scum bag asus board cuz there were no MSI x570 boards available in my country never again and I hope others never buy any Asus product again
How much more do they want to damage their brand lmao Next week some executives get fired or Asus is really done D
Everyone is shilling for their handheld atm it's so pathetic honestly
How did ASUS's branding get so popular Republic of gamers is cringe as hell but maybe I'm missing something here TUF was actually a decent line for the price at one point but it was also cringe marketing Military grade blah blah blah who looks at this and nods to themselves with content satisfaction thinking no way this couldn't be complete bs I just want a competitor that offers reliable products with a sleek and professional design
For many years I google The downfall of ASUS occasionally to see if others feel the same
Behavior like this is what makes me baffled by people so excited for new Asus hardware I'd never consider the Rog Ally thing given how they behave They used to be my go to for motherboards too was a buy it w o concern type of
It's so unfortunate that the only real journalists we have nowadays are GN It's great that we have them in tech but this is why there is Freedom of the Press constitutionally and why democracy was designed with this in mind Journalism is a noble profession when it's working right it's a check and counter to corporate and government corruption
I think everyone here has their own anecdotal story with X company's product failing on them My last ASRock Moba Z97 Extreme 4 has a VERY common boot error F2 A2 that ultimately bricks the board over time Enter my latest build ASUS Tuf board works great except it has the shit Intel Ethernet Controller I225 V which drops internet randomly throughout the day It's all luck of the draw these days It shouldn't be but here we are
As someone with a three month old Strix X670E E with a 7900X and 32GB of DDR5 6000 RAM build this debacle has really made me question switching from Intel to AMD because I'd hoped to not have the trademark Intel socket abandonment garbage to contend only to have a potential ticking time bomb as the foundation of my rig Other than crashes when I initially built because Armory Crate is garbage and I had to reinstall Win10 I haven't experienced any problems running at EXPO II with AI Overclocking turned on Currently running the 1303 BIOS and can attest to the fact that despite what others here have said saw SoC running at 1 35 1 4V Where this video completely fails viewers is to show how to manually set the SoC voltage to a safe level something I picked up on Reddit I dialed that to 1 25V and things seem fine Why Tech Jesus felt spending a half hour bashing ASUS repetitively was beneficial and couldn't set aside 20 30 seconds to show how to take control of our systems until ASUS decides to not be scummy weasels is weak
So what exactly am i supposed to do I have a 7600
Help a layman here I m probably going to buy a 7800x3d Should I avoid ASUS mobo and would I be safe from the exploding CPU mobo issue if I do as such
So as a novice PC enthusiast in the market to pair an x670 with my 7800X3D which brand model do I go with besides Asus Seems like everyone in this thread has some issue with every mobo manufacturer
My 5800X3D has random SOC voltage spikes to what shows 1 55V in ZenTimings on a X470 F gaming Should I be concerned about it
As someone who just bought a openbox ASUS x670e a motherboard along with a 7950x and ram from MC 3 hour drive last weekend before seeing any of this what are your recommendations
There's definitely a bit of contempt from ASUS towards gamernexus Back in April Shamino the Asus forum Moderator posted this in the x670e resource thread then deleted it shortly afterwards Re X670 resource Love u tuber mentality cpu is shorted but the board can supply 1 5v to it still I didnt know the board could supply infinite current this was back when we had even less clarity on the whole issue
This really derailed my new build I'm rocking a 4770K I got at launch 10 years ago It's been solid and still works for D2 and WZ2 but it could be better I was going to go Intel 12 but the early scheduling issues with little BIG P e cores made me wait You don't want to get the brand new generation of the car mentality 13700 looked great but AM5 X3D held promise I was all ready to go Asus B650E E 7800X3D maybe a 7900XT or XTX but then the chips started dying I've held off but now I'm conflicted I liked the B650E Master as well but they don't seem to actually exist ASRock Taichi is nice but they're silly expensive Asus is supposed to be a premium partner for boards GPUs etc but it seems like more and more they're resting on their laurels and name recognition I've not watched this video yet but from everything else I've read and watched it seems like ASRock has done a better job than most They seem to have a not great reputation but most of the hands on stuff all looks positive I love the efficiency of the 7800X3D but I'm wondering if there are other problems with it or even AM5 more generally
A SUS
Always been a big fan of Asus until now They thought they were the reference of PC masterrace Now they ve become the reference of PC scumbags
My first PC build had an ASUS board One day my computer died and I couldn't figure out why Every search I did asserted that the motherboard would sacrifice itself before it let a CPU die So I sent out my board which should have still been under warranty They denied my warranty because a RAM clip was missing They wanted me to pay before they diagnosed it I refused to hand over any details They eventually sent it back and in the package was a note that nothing was wrong with the board My CPU was Intel so I started the process with them as my CPU was still under warranty as well They found fault with the CPU sent me a check and then I bought a different CPU and motherboard I will not buy anything ASUS ever again I work at a school that regularly deploys chromebooks and anytime we need some I remind everyone of ASUS's customer service and shoddy practices and we never get ASUS equipment anymore
I am so glad ASUS is getting some bad publicity In my home country the resellers worship this brand like it's a godsent and use the name to justify jacking up prices nonesense win margin it does not even have to be ROG just ASUS Any company with this low effort low balling attitude deserves to have its name dragged in shit for a while
Asus has got to fix this BS Get a bios that does not void warranty and does not fry the CPU And get it done NOW
Lol Their PR response is a total shitshow I wonder if anyone in charge understands now that whatever bottom line they think they were protecting by trying to discourage RMAs weren't worth the reputation damage potential lawsuits
If I am being entirely honest even though this isnt AMDs fault this entire experience with AM5 Asus x670e e has really turned me off to the platform as a whole I am beginning to think that even though Intel was is a dead socket that I should have stayed with team blue instead of giving AMD a spin Maybe I am just being dramatic but I already feel stuck on this platform I have a board that can't run expo on newer bios versions even though my RAM is on the QVL I have tried every variant so I am stuck on 0805 which is fine for my 7950x but basically locks me out of going to a 7950x3d which was my original plan all along Its a great feeling for a 499 dollar
Gamers Nexus legit the GOATS of gaming and hardware channels
ugh i had a chance to return my mobo cpu and
Glad I went with a B650 Aorus Elite AX for my 7800x3d SOC voltage is 1 245 with Expo
bruh
I've been buying ASUS boards and hardware for 15 years now Last 4 weeks ago a X670E Now in the middle of this show I swear last time I ever bought ASUS I'm done They forget that the customers they are screwing are actually paying their salaries Will make sure they realize
As an end user with one of these motherboards what should is there anything I can do in settings to help with this I'm on the latest 1410 as of writing I have set SoC to 1 2 volts manually and it seems stable enough should I also be limiting other voltages Or is it all worthless because even if I set 1 2 volt SoC it'll just boost higher anyways
Man I m glad I bought the MSI X670e
Asus is the Wal Mart of computer peripherals
I was always a bit of an ASUS fanboy always looked at their products first No longer FUCK ASUS
I had 4 days left to return my ASUS PRIME X670E PRO After seeing how the BIOS still has high voltages ASUS' language on their web page regarding using the BIOS and warranty etc I'm returning the X670E PRO and getting a MSI X670E Tomahawk Not looking forward to wiping my OS and reinstalling everything but them's the breaks
It's weird because ASUS was my go to brand The x470 strix f motherboard or however it's called was really quick to receive an available BIOS update during that whole AMD debacle where AM4 wasn't going to support Zen 3 or 4 And The Zephyrus G14 laptop I have has had great support as well So to say I'm sorely disappointed is an understatement
Haven't used an ASUS board since P5B Deluxe but those were simpler times I was coming from AsRock and DFI AMD 939 boards I never felt the cost justified the higher priced ASUS boards so I never considered them again as their prices were always on the upper end of the range Now with 1000 boards that don't do what they are advertised to do these companies have lost their mind
Wait it wasnt AMD's fault as all the media always rush to blame
This video makes me feel bad for picking a ASUS ROG Strix B650E F Gaming WiFi instead of a ASRock B650E STEEL LEGEND WIFI
who had the pleasure to work with ASUS RMA service knows what pain is
Back when the Athlon first came out I worked my ass off and bought a new Asus board and CPU was about 1200 Set it all up didn t work Sent it back to the shop you burnt out the CPU 1200 in the bin Which was maddening because I built PCs for a living and knew what I was doing About 8 months later Asus came out said there was an issue with their board that can fry AMD cpus Thanks ass holes I was so pissed off I moved to console gaming and bought a laptop Haven t owned a desktop or an AMD product since I see they haven t changed
On a X570 have a Asus laptop about to upgrade both systems Bye bye Asus
I was probably one of those that were saying ASrock doesn't have these issues and I'm glad I went there When this happened I thought hmm but my SOCv didn't go to 1 4v with Expo so i checked and indeed it was 1 35 even in software measurements Aida 64 Funny that As someone coming from long term intel back to AMD from the Barton XP2500 era this is pretty disappointing all around from a reliability standpoint
At 26 50 in the video So because Asus pulled the wording from an AMD advisory they think it's on AMD to explain why Asus are using that wording in this context It's becoming a pattern for Asus to try to find a way to blame AMD every time they fuck something up
ASUS has clearly done some really stupid things but I do also think some of the issues raised in the video aren't likely intentionally malicious I'll go over the obviously bad first Releasing beta BIOSs based on internal test builds of AGESA that were not meant to be public and attempting to void your warranty if you use them is monumentally stupid and they should never have done this and should never do it again The possible attempt to bribe people to prevent independent media from getting failed parts is really shady and they should not be doing that Now the things I don't really think are intentionally malicious Updating the supported since BIOS version page and removing older BIOSs I would have done the same as ASUS in this case yes it can cause confusion by changing them but there are clear issues with older BIOS versions and you don't want people downloading them or thinking their old version is fine As Steve points out this could be communicated better by leaving notes and disabling the downloads of older versions but it also might be quite hard to actually do that with how their systems website is designed Its good constructive feedback and they should do what he suggests even if it requires changing their systems website to allow it Regarding ASUS's recommendation to disable EXPO I would have agreed with ASUS on this one if it wasn't for Steve and the teams findings that at least some memory doesn't work at completely stock voltages I think ASUS were just trying to suggest a simple temporary solution with the least chance of causing other problems and missed that fact I do not have data to support this but my speculation is this could be because hynix memory in particular is known to use very high dimm voltages compared to the stock JEDEC spec Also while they showed the difference turning EXPO off makes I do want to reiterate that while the results are correct cpu memory benchmarks are often not representative of actual circumstances as they are designed to be as CPU bound as possible to show the maximum possible difference that memory speed latency can cause For a lot of builds a lot of people would never even notice that EXPO is turned off unless they are playing at very high fps or playing games that are very CPU limited I do think all these BIOS and voltage issues will get fixed but its going to take a while AMD has to update AGESA and the mobo vendors need to then update and hopefully thoroughly test their new BIOS versions based on it
Typical Asuck's move lol
I'm so glad i kept procrastinating my upgrade to 7000x3d cpu with asus x670e gene i had in plans Welp now i can just scratch that expensive as duck mobo and go with msi mortar Thanks ASUS you just helped me save a lot of money there
Asus has always been a slimy company at their higher tier products I work in consumer pc repair and let me TELL YOU the amount of times I see these boards ship with issues or have issues early on sorry to say but it's often like ASRock Never will in my life ever recommend them post 2012 Now a days I strongly recommend MSI if you want premium or Gigabyte if you want budget
No reviewer should EVER be posting benchmarks in future which promote products if you first have to change some bios setting in the special warranty void if used pages in bios setup
I switched to ASRock some years ago and I am satisfied Many say that ASRock is low quality brand but I build a lot of PCs in the last 5 years with ASRock mobos and there are no issues so far
So have there been any documented cases of Asus actually denying someone warranty because they used one of the beta bios I get the feeling this will be reversed and no one will actually be denied a warranty claim
asus quality is dogshit in the last 2 years
Oh I bet those Youtubers use a lot of Asus products themselves and called them Scumbags for publicity Asus and amd will fix the problem and continue to make awesome stuff
Funny I'm pleased I have AsRock B650E Reptile WiFi which has excellent voltages Asus an extreme prime superior way to put your 600 800 dollars into the trash
The most important thing for me when buying a product is the warranty I'll shell out more money for a product if I know for certain that company is going to stand behind their product and give excellent support Logitech for one Their warranty process is as painless as it gets so even though it's 200 bucks for a wireless mouse i'll pony it up because I know if the switches fail on me i'll be getting a replacement with zero effort I haven't had an ASUS board since my Z190 I'm looking for a B550 to replace my B450 now I picked up a 5800X3D and was looking at ASUS but now I think I'll just go MSI
MSI Meg Ace X670E has been working quite well for me two plus months with the 7950X3D no issue so far Just updated to the latest bios as well
Man this has been the first time I went with AMD since I started building PC's and the 7000's series has been nothing but issues since day 1 It sucks because the chips are great from a performance standpoint and the platform in theory is beautiful but due to how AMD and vendors who work with AMD have been handling things I likely will just end up going back to Intel and selling my ASUS board and CPU Probably gunna get downvoted because of the sub but I really feel angry with board partners and AMD for not holding said board vendors accountable
Don't buy ASUS products anymore end of thread
I'm glad I waited for the AM5 platform to get all the bugs ironed out first Although this more of an ASUS problem than a platform problem still loosely related
And the sad bit They're still the best alternative in terms of motherboard hw quality and in 80 of cases 700 mobos do not make sense it's just companies competing to one up each
Why is their no comparison with MSI Gigabyte and ASROCK So we get an objective view Who is doing what right and wrong AMD Should also clean if they are pushing out half arse AGESA updates I knew the AM5 platform was potentially crap when the long post boot up times were being normalised in this release
ASUS More like ANUS rolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughing
Asus has officially lost me as a customer from all this I'll go back to MSI gigabyte Not only this they didn't give me a new in box when I had an issue with my X670e hero or send me my original box back and lost some of the original things I sent back I am extremely pissed I chose them as a 700 dollar board
This is not going to end well for Asus Very pleased to own Gigabyte and ASRock which both support ECC
Asus fucked around and found out
No more Asus products for me after the Hololive collab was cancelled smart move on my part
I was considering getting an Asus ROG Ally it s getting pretty good reviews Not after this fiasco though
Oh look it's grimace the nasal mop
JAYZ twocents dropping ASUS v wZ QVOKGVyM pp ygUMamF5enR3b2NlbnRz
He s really determined to be the most unlikeable person in tech
ASUS is the bud light of PC parts
I like Asus still They've been really reliable for me especially for the price
I m kind of impressed how much of a jerk circus Gamernexus is exploiting for viewership Let me breakdown the FUD Your video start off with pure FUD conjecture and then continue to use bombastic blame game SOC This is on Amd it was VDIMM VSOC Turn on EXPO leave SOC on Auto increase DDR speeds SOC auto increase up to a then AMD cap of 1 4v 3 33 how is it possible you cannot post with load optimised default This has to be bullshit and fake 5 40 compares Hero to non OC Answer 5 45 your measurement is at the socket MLCC There will be voltage drop before it reaches CPU die What are your LLC levels at 8 20 Asus has release beta bios with this disclaimer before even this hooha It is for those who want to make use of latest to play test 11 48 ALL AM5 boards had cpu voltage adjustment enabled this is AMD Agesa oversight until DER8AUR killed a 7950X3D Amd told all their partners to hide Cpu voltage for X3D afterwards 16 29 what is wrong with this disclaimer EXPO does not mean your CPU can run at EXPO speed 18 42 ALL AM5 partners remove their older bios Why you single Asus out For your hooha no Steve you have not come back to explain how OCP is supposed to work on AM5 How much did Asus undershoot their OCP for their Hero board What were you bios setting when you intentionally killed that 7800X3D
Can't some fault lie on AMD for this mess Maybe that's why they're throwing their hands up and essentially saying they don't want to be responsible for issues customers are having because of AMD's firmware bios THAT I could understand I mean it's not like this is happening to their Intel boards or that there was an issue with Asus before the AM5 socket
I agree that Asus is scummy but AMD is also at fault here The only reason they increased VSOC is for Expo to work and be stable Does Expo work at voltage 1 3V
I just switched to AMD when the 7800X3D was released Bought a STRIX B650E I as well I came from a 13700K STRIX Z690 I and only swapped because AMD had less power draw and slightly better performance face with rolling eyes Not sure how I feel about this right now Not going to bother with AMD again or ASUS for that matter Now I'm just happy that I didn't buy a AMD gpu as well grinning squinting face Intel and team green once again prove them self as the safest choice
Totally agreed with Nexus in AMD worst productivity on prew videos and also this one about Asus boards But its always BUT what happen with AsRock boards Gigabyte boards MSI and NZXT exploading AMD CPU s
Class action lawsuit when
My cpu doesn t get hot at all What motherboard is this
face exhalingcigarette ah yes this is perfect pay attention to Asus boards if you're looking for an Intel build in the next 4 5 months people their prices are going to drop like a rock and they're still solid boards at least on the Intel side
That has been my experience with Asus as well I was super happy with their P8P67 board more than a decade ago and have been buying their stuff ever since their mobos GPUs sound cards laptops any hardware I needed I was automatically going with Asus I did the same with their AM5 X670 E E and it has been problems all the way mainly with memory and I had to RMA the first board because 3 USB ports did not work After a long exchange with Asus support about Expo not working they told me it's my CPU that is the problem I will not do the Asus mistake ever again
Can someone truly give me any examples issue similar on intel side I believe this shot completely belongs amd Just give me link article anything is there any issue on intel Currently running ryzen 5600 6750 xt radeon and i so much regret to build amd shitty system
If he can show proven cases of asus actively denying actual warranty claims of users with burnt boards due to this issue only then does he have a point Until then hes just raging Also just how many users are even affected Many questions to be answered before Im ready to write off asus
M5 is such a mess between the overpriced chipsets and CPUs 3D ones having to disable half cores to be effective with questionable software handling this like the bug if you switch CPU without reinstalling Windows and now this burning cpu and motherboards fiasco They are overpricing their M5 lineup based on the good job they made with M4 but that's clearly not the case for their new gen
x200B ASUS gif giphy 1UTnKV5cUwr8DYDNdj downsized
Well sadly have the board they use in this video Still on 1202 bios I've just manually set everything minus Glad I did rather than listen to others saying just update and forget Still goes over on the new bios Think sadly manually setting it is the way to go this gen can make it a lot lower than these guys are auto setting it too
Huh asus was always my goto for mainboards Guess Ill have to consider evga asrock gigabyte now
Aw damnit I was just looking at their TUF gaming laptops and was dead set on getting one this summer
Should I swap my Asus B650e i with the ASRock B650E PG ITX I have 7800X3D
I once used Asus back in Amd phenom era Now I m using Gigabyte Auros mobo
First AMD build this weekend I had an Intel Asus board that worked just fine but something in me thought it would be fun to change it up I'm glad I did went with MSI
Glad I decided to return my asus amd bundle and go with an intel variants
My first graphics card was an ASUS R9 Thing was a turd I don't know what they did to it but it didn't function with AMD's drivers for over two years and the last driver revision ASUS put out still had that DX11 crashing bug I wasn't able to get a refund and I couldn't run anything DX11 until Adrenalin Worst part was they straight up lied advertising it calling it DX11 ready in big bold on the sale page I've been telling people to avoid ASUS for years
Hi steve
gamers nexus
I stopped buying anything from ASUS after the x370 crossfire hero 6 board I still have it in a server and it still has boot issues even with a 3600x in it 't have the money to replace that board
gamers nexus if officially the bullshit caller outer
not a single company in the world is the good guy this has to be in your mind x200B i dont think they are bad guys they are just incompetent and failing
I built my computer two days ago Asus B650E I with 7700x 6000mhz ddr5 I tried updating to the bios that lowered the limit to 1 3v for the 7000x3d but that didn't do anything for me I tried expo and the voltage was around 1 35 Without expo my ram is on 4800mhz So I cannot use expo until they release a non beta bios with the fix for my Cpu without voiding warranty But we void warranty if we even touch the expo button in the bios altogether Fuck I just wanted to game I mean I still can but I don't want to worry
I was about to pull the trigger on a 7800X3D with Asus motherboard when this whole debacle started It sucks because I really wanted either the ROG Strix B650E F or E E Now considering other manufacturers or just waiting until Asus releases an official BIOS update
Steve links to this video as well Same thing but with Intel XMP v I2gQ bOnDx8 v I2gQ bOnDx8 Providing link here ICYMI TL DW Intel honours the warranty even when XMP is used
We need to protect our lord of coils I bet that eye of AsuSauron is watching him
Nowadays these business executives treat consumers as fools They want to cheat us out of our money
Holy shit I was OOTL I have an Asus z690 running a 13th gen cpu What's the TLDR on this anyone
How can we be sure they didnt ASUS other platforms like AM4 or LGA1700 I can see them slowly killing other chips but this one just happened to be far more egregious and others are currently going under the radar
Great way to murder your brand credibility Makes a mistake that might break user CPU and Motherboard release confusing updates then tells the user if you use it you will void warranty which generate more anxiety in consumers Who the fuck would buy from you now Asus I paid a premium 500 dollar board from Asus for my 7950X3D because of their reputation but now I lowkey want to return the board and go with someone else
Now I don't even know which motherboard to get lol I'm debating been getting the 5800x3d or the 7800x3d Both cpu's require me to get a new motherboard and I literally don't know which one is trustworthy anymore
I've been busy and out of the loop for most of the AMD 7000 cpu heat bubble thing Can someone tldr it all for me Sounds like it's mostly Asus' fault
I have a new gigabyte board and 7800x3d sitting unopened Really debating returning and going to Intel
what if you are using XMP modules i take you have no issues
I've been using a ROG X670E A since the 7800X3D launched Fuck this company Damn shame I was excited for the ROG Ally too
Steve 1 Multimillion dollar corporation 0
ASUS is gonna be sending the Pinkertons next lol
I ve been on Asus for a long as I can remember I got all Asus set up right now After this tho no more
NO more ASUS motherboards for me either my b450 F has been a nightmare late bioses had to RMA 3x due to dead audio on 3 boards unacceptable QC fan section is still half broken in the latest bios terrible voltage regulation even with a seasonic prime PSU
Makes me sad I've got an Asus motherboard and bought an Asus phone some years ago Really wanted to help and support a Taiwanese company
This was the only time I bought an expensive motherboard too
Asus better be bundling their boards with a fire extinguisher and an AMD RMA ticket number
So over Asus this will do it
I wish I got the Asrock Taichi rather than the Crisshair Hero I m looking at my board and sweating bullets
I have a Ryzen 5 7600 non x with a asus b650e f Will I have any issues or its just the X3D CPUs
Just finished my build yesterday 7950x3d x670e tuf Shall I return the mobo
I have an Asus ROG Strix x670e e board that I purchased just over 3 weeks ago I technically can return it via amazon through the end of the month but I honestly do not know what board is comparable to replace it with I have never had EXPO turned on on this board MicroCenter built it for me just last weekend and they put on the 1410 bios and told me to NOT enable EXPO and wait for a stable bios to release and update 'in the next few days weeks' While I understand the frustration everyone is having I'd like to know if my CPU is in any danger with EXPO turned off I have checked in the bios through iCUE and other software monitoring software and my voltage does not exceed roughly 1 14 which even with the claimed 'up to 0 1 higher' still puts it under the safe value of 1 3 If I were inclined to return this board and have to pay for it to be replaced at MicroCenter due to these issues which brand board should I be looking at with similar identical stats Any help would be appreciated
Good thing the Asus motherboard I was comparing with was like 150 CAD more than MSI That pushed me to picking MSI
Really bummed Was going to target ASUS for my next build Guess I'm gonna have to look elsewhere Hopefully ASUS gets the book thrown at them for thier actions
Asus really don't know how to deal with fuckups This is so stupid Also AMD should really step in and do
The only ASUS hardware in my home is the NIC in my HTPC It's an old one but I'm still tempted to swap out for another brand Doubt it'll be a problem anywhere near the Galaxy of what happened here
I haven't used an Asus board in a few years now Glad I didn't use them with my 7700X build
It s really sad where manufacturers place their bets So you have a product that is a premium product but you won t stand by it I don t think I ll be able to get behind Asus until they actually start supporting their own oroducts
So this is all great and love the journalism but I'm still unclear what I as an owner should do Currently running 7950x Hero X680E Mobo GSkill 6000mhz DDR5 EXPO1 enabled I have not updated to this new beta bios and have not made any changes to the bios settings except for Expo1 Do I need to update any voltages or what No intention of updating to any beta BIOS
Should I worry as an owner of this board and an 7800x3d
At least I know what my next motherboard vendor isn't going to be from
Going by the reviews from Newegg I think we should go with MSI Tomahawk Wifi motherboard for the x670e chipset Asrock Taichi is too expensive What other reputable brands are there Gigabyte also seems iffy
I have an old Asus x370 board and I've had no real problems with it However after they dragged ass to update the BIOS to support newer Ryzen chips when every other manufacturer was doing it I lost any good will I had toward them
Was the meter GN was using calibrated and did they check the vsoc voltage on other cpus Also was this intentional overvolting or accidental
Don t forget their trash 5700xt TUF They milked their name
Does this happen with newer Asus laptops I had my eyes on one but now I m second guessing myself
looks like a good time for a EVGA motherboard resurgence
Seriously though I have a build waiting to be finished and I just need a motherboard I have no idea what to get with these issues that keep popping up
At least we now know what max SOC voltage is considered safe
Glad I switched from Asus back to asrock when I moved from AM4 to AM5
Does the beta bios void the warranrty instantly as soon as you install it on your mobo or is the warranty only void if only something happens to your mobo and the bios installed do you still have a warranty if in the future they release a non beta bios thank you if someone will answer this as english is not my first language and I might not fully understand the disclaimer
Have been ASUS customers since last 10 years it's sad to see the quality go down Are reviewers aware of various safe voltages when they review CPUs Having said that never ever buy 1st generation product with new stack like DDR5 PCIe 5 0 etc Heck my 3800x on x570 would randomly shutdown due to USB issue during the pandemic Sad state of affairs to say the least
What's astounding is their hubris Imagine how high you must think of yourself where you're willing to violate an NDA with AMD or Intel or whoever you're working with and throw them under the bus I actually appreciate the spine it takes but they're not doing it out of some virtue they're doing it because they feel they can run anyone down no matter who they are be it customer or business partner I'd love to setup a camera in their corporate suites just to see these sons of bitches shoot the shit
Between the cheap and expensive they re the value usually I ve never bought a premium part for my builds Although I do feel sad for those who do and get a worse experience than most like in this example
So months they threw in DDR5 6000 and I haven't been able to do that rebuild yet Am I gonna be okay as long as the FIRST thing I do is update to the latest BIOS that limits the SOC voltage
I've always used Gigabyte I did have problems with their Threadripper X399 Xtreme but it was new tech and a dodgy CPU socket I still have it somewhere My current board is X570 Xtreme and is running well with a 5900X I have 4x16GB RAM sticks in it running at 3600 CL16 My partner has an Asus X570 E board considered one of the best X570 at the time It won't run the 4x8GB kit I removed from my Xtreme 3600C16 and it gives WHEA 19 errors and random restarts Even increasing RAM voltage to 1 38 didn't help Gave up after that I'm not a 'tweaker' it either works properly or doesn't We both decided never to buy Asus boards again and that was before the current problems Our PSUs are both ROG Strix 850W and 1000W and my monitor is a 4K ROG TUF which is fine
So im now at a Point where no board manufacturers are left Gigabyte I ve had so many issues with Gigabyte products over the last decade including the first revision of the x570 Aorus Master that they are on my eternal do not buy list MSI was also a disaster class over the last decade and now they are also a security disaster ASUS well the latest issues should be enough explanation This leaves who exactly except ASRock who also aren t really a paragon of quality Would be easier to bear if boards were still 100 200
I also returned my Asus motherboard so done with this company and their anticonsumer behaviour I truly do not understand why these companies destroy their own reputation like this Are the people in charge sleeping or what
I ve an ASU s x370 Pro board and while it works It s always been a point of doubt with any stability issues I have
Just to be sure I watched multiple videos now about the amd x3D CPUs exploding My current Board is the ASUS ROG STRIX B650E E and I got the 7950x3D I updated to BIOS version 1413 which states SoC voltage for Ryzen 7000X3D series limited to a maximum of 1 30V to protect the CPU and motherboard In the video however it's mentioned that ASUS still didn't fixed the issue So is it safe now with BIOS 1413 or not I'm a little confused If it's not safe should I just not use my PC until something got fixed The situation rn sucks
I used to like Asus but I've the years I've been using MSI No complaints really
In all honesty how is this not already reached the realm of a major lawsuit for Fraud Thats the vibe I am getting here Also who the fuck pays for motherboards of their price category Seems like this corporate greed was bound to happen
I buy Asus this one time and now this BS I updated my bios to the latest stable BIOS and it has never hit over 2 40V on the SOC So it seems fine But the fact its not listed and the BETA is above is dumb on their Website Edit Should I swap board
Ugh I was not going to use Asus anyway but hearing of there still being problems and people reporting boards still feeding too much power to the cpu even if you specifically set it lower is so worrisome I really loved everything I saw about the 7800x3d based on reviews and thought I would finally make the switch with all the praise AMD has been getting recently for their newer CPUs but now I'm torn on what to do I bought the CPU but was waiting on funds to buy the rest of my build and now I don't even know if I should still commit to it or if I should return the CPU before it's too late I really was interested in the x3d and lower power and increased performance but now I question if I should just stick with Intel I haven't had a single issue with any of their CPUs in the past 15 years since I switched off of AMD to them
For my ASUS TUF X670E Plus WiFi with beta BIOS 1601 the warning prompt has been removed when I selected the EXPO II and from the BIOS 1601's download section
For reference I'm done with Asus since like 20 years ago when I bought their graphic card with TV output It turns out that the output was never enabled or supported
Just did a RMA for MSI MB no issues Was even 1 month passed 3y warranty and they still doing it on their dime Only took 2 emails
They will probably issue a statement soon or do something else the Rog handheld sales might get affected
Shame coz their lateat laptop offerings are actually appealing and reasonably priced Also good features such as LM and miniled screen OTOH their mobos are a horrible deal Offering less at a higher markup than their competition Sadly they remain the prime partner of AMD
The last good product from Asus that i remember was M4A77TD mobo with core unlocker Phenom 2 feature

If you look at my profile you ll see a post about me chasing my tail I have a ASUS MOBO with a 5900x and everything was working great until I enabled like profile 2 or whatever it s called and immediately had issues and blue screen and crashes I ended up disabling the profile thing I m very new to pc and RMA my CPU an since then it s ram absolutely fine Out of curiosity since this whole debacle has been going on I put in my old 5600 and enabled profile 1 and sure as shit it fried my 5600 I m currently saving up to get another MOBO but being new PC idk which one to buy for AM4 I was thinking MSI until they got hit with ransomware I don t know anything about NZXT or gigabyte Outside of those 4 are they any other manufacturers who make good boards
I bought a X670E Tuf Gaming motherboard for my new build with a 7800X3D that I won t be able to return How screwed am I What should I be looking out for once the new CPU arrives
So this board shown in the video shows the website release notes for the beta bios and it voiding the warranty Today it removed that warranty void statement but the release notes are now in quotes So would this allow them to defer to the original statement of that quote and still void your warranty
From GN's HW News today According to Steve Asus contacted them before the Scumbag video went up offering to send some reps to talk to them about the situation Steve replied when do you want to come out and how many mics do we need when we film this Asus never answered back basically showing how chickensh t they are t 361 t 361
I always thought ASUS was the Rolls Royce of PC gaming enthusiasts My God have times have tragically changed
Asus made a mistake well several mistakes This can still be resolved if Asus decided to communicate more effectively I have Asus products for a very long time and they are good ROG and Asus Their hardware is better than their software and that is still an issue in many ways but the hardware industry is still trying to get the grips with the soft side GN has done a brilliant work and Asus must follow it through
Ugh wish I could follow suit with boycotting but Asus is the only board for amd that has thunderbolt without needing an add on card
Is this a bad time to tell y all I got a 7800x3d pairing it with asus b650a motherboard
I just recently bought their B650E F board should I be worried
Fuck ASUS They ship out the Dual OC 8GB RX 580 with factory settings that at least for my card make the display disconnect It's at 1360 MHz frequency default and whenever my card goes over 1257 my screen disconnects but my game discord call 's MoBo and told me to talk to their support It wasn't Dell's fault ASUS sucks
S slightly out of spec FSB etc and people are only now complaining
i changed my VDDIO to 1 24 as it was at 1 37 originally with EXPO II enabled hwinfo now says 1 26 1 28v is the VDDIO versus the 1 37 before is the 1 26 1 28 a safe voltage for consistent use or should i go lower i have a 7900x x670 p asus mobo 6000mhz ram CL40
My Asus crosshair extreme x670e mobo and 7950x3d have been great for more than a month of 24 7 use I sent Asus a 3080 gpu that was killed by a coolant leak and they sent me a new one no questions asked For 30 years Asus has been great Don t listen to sellout spoiled brats like jays two cents It s worth exactly twocents or less
I bought an asus rog strix b550 A motherboard a while ago Should I return it then And what should I replace it with that's good and for the same price I bought the asus motherboard for 160 tax
Been telling for few years that ASUS especially ROG branding is premium just in price Sure all other corps have some fuck ups too but man ASUS just doesn't give a single fuck
I caught so much shit when this thing first started from ASUS fanboys I was simply stating that a lot of complaints were from people with ASUS products The fanboys railed me saying Asus sells more hope those guys see this and it helps improve their logical reasoning moving forward
I've been passing on Asus for around a decade thanks to this way of thinking This particular example has been years in the making
The uninformed will continue to by all of their ROG shit because it looks cool That s the saddest part
I think some of the hostility is unwarranted A bunch is though Like pulling all the firmware It s probably the only quick way in their deployment setup to make them inaccessible Making firmware with a known hardware destroying bug inaccessible is the right move Changing the sported since firmware XXXX when it used to date an earlier version could just be trying to make sure nobody thinks those older drivers are safe if they get them from someplace else Are they denying warranty or did some dude who got a call in the wee hours to make a jillion changes to the website just slap the stranded software no warranty of merchantability etc boiler plate on there These things I think are just people seeing conspiracy where there s just trying to do the least wrong thing as fast as possible while in panic mode I do think criticism is due for the mess they are making just to avoid saying we messed up They really need to pull their heads out of their ass regarding publishing firmware they say it s fixed but is still broken All of the above is really a distraction from this imo I could give a crap if their ego is too big to say oops but that they didn t actually fix the problem is a big problem
The last premium board I picked up was EVGA As far as I know it stopped being useful when a Win10 update started blue screening and a later update was fine but the friend I have it to had moved on already Meanwhile I've picked up MSI Acer and Gigabyte boards without issues that Asus consistently puts forward All for a lower price too
Pay an intern
only pays one intern to update BIOSes on the support website pushing out things that should not have been released The story behind this as I heard it from O https O a few bios people got jobs at other places One guy Shamino had to and possibly still has to take care of all the BIO for every board That's a lot of work for one dude The guy is actually pretty awesome I've interacted with them several times and they work pretty hard trying to incorporate things people would like in terms of OC But damn why hasn't ASUS hired more people At least one more person instead of one guy doing all the work
Linus has gone on record advising to never buy the ultra premium version of a thing largely for this very reason t 453
It is so sad And probably these AM5 boards will be left to die since I don't think Asus really gives a fuck to sort this shit show out Exactly as you said Asus keeps its head down and everything will be OK eventually
For my ASUS TUF X670E Plus WiFi with beta BIOS 1601 the warning prompt has been removed when I selected the EXPO II and from the BIOS 1601's download section
lol nice fake news dude face with tears of joy
And attempting to bribe people to NOT send their hardware to GamersNexus Holy shit
The rog ally looks like a nice handheld but given how bad Asus's reputation has been when it comes to engaging with the community especially the open source software communities I'll stick to my steam deck
I can confirm this with my Intel 13700KF in an Asus ROG Strix Z790 H board My games started crashing to the desktop after working fine for 3 weeks I replaced every single piece of hardware to include my motherboad to no avail Finally after feeling defeated I went to best buy and got a new 13700K and everything started working fine again I will NEVER purchase another ASUS motherboard ever again I now have an MSI board and will only buy MSI boards from now on Newegg will be refunding me for this worthless paperweight of an ASUS board and now I have to RMA this 13700KF
I mean Steve runs an internet media setup based in america Where accountability and red tapes are none existence for him Let see him run a real company or work in real tech setup let see if he can get that cocky gungho and just gun blazingly entertain internet setups at a snap of
GN are great I can attest to their deskpad as well I like Full desk mouse pads and I ve been using one from them for over a year now Still looks sharp as ever
I thought about getting one of their shirts or mouse mats once but their shipping rates outside of the US killed it for me
Seriously one of the few PC focused channels I trust for honesty and well investigated topics
The big mouse mat works great and so far seems like real quality I did some digging before buying just as a stand alone product and I think it's a good purchase I got the big rubber mat too for projects but haven't done a project yet though again it does seem like quality This was my first time buying from a YouTube channel These products are a bit expensive but between quality is worth it to me and support is a bonus
Yup I never buy merch from sponsored places or youtubers But gladly did for the first time today
Just bought their mod mat recently to protect my PC while I upgraded it Couldn't be happier with the product and knowing that my money is helping fund such great independent journalism
GN doing real work while the rest of these youtubers just ride the wave
Eh I feel they are too often click hunters and outrage different
I love Tech Jesus but at the same time I wish he released 5 minute versions of his videos that just summarize whatever he's talking about
PC part industry is a case of pick your poison really Right now it feels like picking the part is based on who is objectively the least worst
So thats ASUS Gigabye and MSI on the list for me now guessing I am an asrock or evga guy now
Kinda wanna buy the EVGA Mobo to replace my z90 and give the middle finger to Asus
Same at least not for a while and i probably won't buy ASUS motherboards ever again i believe gigabyte and msi are better
Same glad I went with giga
I'm feeling pretty happy that I've got zero Asus products in my house right now I think I'll keep it that way
What are you going to buy
I won't say never but I just built an almost entire Asus machine the O11 Dynamic XL ROG edition ROG Strix board Thor power supply I was like the Thor has a 10 year warranty generally their mobos up until recently obviously were considered solid So I leaned into it and got the case with it Now my position is fuckem but I'll wait to see if they try and make it up given the backlash
Ditto Looks like it's down to MSI AsRock 're feeling spicy
I recently got a ASUS Vivobook S14 Flip for college It comes with a 5600H With a bit of tweaking I managed to get it to nearly 20 hours of battery life on daily note taking and some light youtube watching For 499 that's was a pretty good fucking deal for a capable little tablet workstation for when I do coding and stuff physics graduate school gif emote free emotes pack dizzy face
If someone else would release an x670 itx board I would drop my asus board in a heartbeat
That is the right move ASUS has had a very long history of screwing their customers over It is hard to believe how much effort AMD puts into avoiding taking proper responsibility for their failures when just fixing the situation would be so much easier
I started thinking like that due to their phone support it seems the same people took over the whole company
Yeah I ve had one DOA board and one that wouldn t boot with ram that was on their QVL
Avoided them for years they have been assholes for years
I'm not buying from them after my Phenom II MOBO died soon after warranty It started more as a superstition and simply just going for anything tells till that one fails on me Turns out I lost absolutely nothing by avoiding ASUS for like a decade now Also they're kinda overly expensive compared to other brands while all premium is being in premium price only
So Which of these 4 mobo companies would you buy from now Msi With their shady review practices Gigabyte Their bad QA PSU going BOOM Asus scumbag company Asrock have blacklisted GN for negative reviews They all have issues Personally I find Asrock MSI to be the worst because they have tried to extort small creators to publish good reviews Last year with the Z690 Asus stuff ASUS fixed the issue quickly This time they fucked serverely up and did not fix the issue fast
Abit boards were rock solid and no frills They were perfect I miss them
DFI LanParty boards were so god damn good
EVGA is still solid They don't make a lot of products tough And i think they've only made boards for AMD with X570
Gotta break out this classic maxwidth 640 shape thumb fidelity medium
I had multiple Abit BX133 they were so good
The NF7 S and my Barton 2500 M made one of the best platforms I've had in this hobby in the past 30 years
Mate Abit was rubbish in a lot of extent They were slow if you didn't tune the boards The NF6 board was the first one that eliminated PS 2 connectors only received USB keyboard and mouse but they didn't work The mobo parts were just cheap and bad quality
Abit was always the best
Ironically IIRC DFI was only ever as good as they were in the consumer market because the Abit engineer that invented stuff like jumperless overclocking via boot block BIOS manipulation soft menu III went to work for DFI around the time Abit started winding down His name is Oskar Wu and he was the fucking man Before he came along we were all stuck configuring CPU multipliers and FSB speeds via blocks of literal physical jumpers on the board Obviously this influenced the entire industry when was the last time anyone had to actually use a jumper in any capacity beyond clearing CMOS to correct their own mistake To anyone reading this who thinks it sounds like I'm just blowing smoke up some random Taiwanese guy's ass for no reason you've gotta understand that for hardware enthusiasts and overclockers his contributions were as substantial as things like the invention of ABS or traction control were for automobiles Who knows how many of Oskar's innovations live on in pretty much every modern system Can you imagine doing a CPU upgrade and having to dig out the manual for your board and fuck with half a dozen jumpers to set the multiplier then fuck with another half a dozen jumpers to set the voltage then fuck with even more jumpers to set the bus speed It was terrible Didn't help that proper search engines hadn't been invented yet and that just snagging a pdf of the manual somewhere online wasn't an option If you didn't have the manual and there wasn't enough room on the board for them to silkscreen a block diagram for the jumpers you were gonna have a bad time I dunno what Oskar is doing these days but I hope he knows that his massive contributions to the hobby and to the industry as a whole haven't been forgotten
My bad Years ago I bought an Abit board and they went under Years ago I bought an AOpen board and then they went under Years ago I bought an Intel 'm fucking cursed
Man DFI had some crazy looking boards back in the day I remember them well
DFI pure class these where I remember the Lanparty boards having the UV plastic around the PCI slots to glow under a UV light
Who makes good boards these days I used ASUS and Gigabyte in the past and they're both shit What are the cool kids into now
DFI was awesome
Yeah DFI and Abit were awesome Asus also used to be awesome For that matter I really liked my socket 939 board from MSI It s all gone significantly downhill for home builders in the past 10 years
I've still got two abit NF7 S 2 0 boards for socket A Good times soldering wires from the 3 3v rail to the dimm slot to run Winbond BH 5 memory at 500Mhz cas 2 2 2 5
My final Abit board was the IC7 MAX3 I think I may still have it in storage
I built a few Nforce2 DFI Lan Party based systems and had no issues or complaints They came with a cool harness with a handle to hold your tower for easy transport to a Lan Party Good ol days with the pencil trick and later unlocked Barton XP 2500 overclocked to be a XP 3200
What makes an enthusiast board for you I think there are still some out there
Abit was fantastic Would buy nothing else in the late 90s early 2000s
When you're spending over 1000 on a CPU and Motherboard it shouldn't have out of the box issues that will slowly destroy both It needs to be a media circus if this gets normalized you'll start to find that PCs start blowing themselves up after a few years and that's somehow normal Last time we went down that rabbit hole you had nvidia GPUs that would desolder themselves and the great capacitor plague from the 2000's that both caused a lot of problems
I mean AMD is honoring warranty and even shipping them and Steve said that EXPO has no control over SOC voltage but the MOBO but they aren't pulling this shady VOIDING warranty shit
The only change we'd be likely to see is either more restrictions for overclocking or locking it down completely
While AMD did fuck up some here with the SOC voltages not being investigated recommended lower to motherboard manufacturers prior to this shitshow They've immediately said they would reimburse replace CPUs for users Regardless of using OC settings or not Most other board manufacturers have also been pushing out solid updates and following recommendations from AMD It's only Asus that have pulled this using our beta bios to fix our fuck up will void your warranty shit
Has always been this Intel's position has always been that overclocking voids your warranty then they release a line of CPUs specifically for overcloxking and upcharge for
funny thing is that if you look closer its only a very small percent with this
I'm close to upgrading my system new CPU mobo and RAM currently have a 8700K and a RTX 3080 which not surprisingly I'm not interested in replacing now or prolyl for 2 3 years If I'm thinking about a Ryzen 7 7700X is this anything to worry about at all I have two Wishlist on newegg One for a intel upgrade and one for a ryzen upgrade Price difference is small enough where that is not a deciding factor for me Also I'm not getting an ASUS motherboard anyways but esp after this Prolly gigabyte or maybe ASROCK Really the only other two options I can think of My current and last mobo are were MSI and I'd like to try a dif brand this time around for the heck of it but again obv not ASUS at the moment
There should be some law that requires manufactures to cover things with warranty that they advertise
Those metrics are what people want to see and that's what consumers will buy ignoring the multiple obvious warnings Obviously Asus is in the wrong here but it's consumers who have allowed them to get away with it for all these years
Last one I had was The Black Pearl for my old e8400 solid mobo but a lot changes in 15 years
I was going to buy Asus last year and then my zenphone and asus router got issues and the support was exactly like how Asus's warrantly claim policies showcased right now Asus does the best juicing up stuff but most of them tend to be experimental with no QC and when it fails you're done You won't get proper support for random reasons Truly for those who dare as Steve mocked
lol same first time using an ASUS mobo bad time to start I guess
I m super sad by all this This is my 4th Asus board I ve always enjoyed the experience and usually don t even look at other brands I know their product range really well and that makes shopping easier But this will probably be my last Asus board
same
My current computer is about to go out so I was just buying parts this week for my new build I had Asus in my cart earlier this week Not no more and not for a long time either
They've been solid until now You jinxed it
Literally just got my Strix x670e e the day the 7800x3d came out All this shit came out after my Microcenter return period was over
Return it and get another board This has annoyed me x200B Please note that this is a beta BIOS version of the motherboard which is still undergoing final testing before its official release The UEFI its firmware and all content found on it are provided on an as is and as available basis ASUS does not give any warranties whether express or limited as to the suitability compatibility or usability of the UEFI its firmware or any of its content Except as provided in the Product warranty and to the maximum extent permitted by law ASUS is not responsible for direct special incidental or consequential damages resulting from using this beta BIOS
I got mine 3 months ago
Same here Also does this for decades I cheated my principels and bought a asus monitor 2 or 3 years
Regarding the Asus Ally they have a terrible history of supporting hardware outside their usual wheelhouse Their phones were released and left to languish as an example
Asus has had a poor support track record as someone else mentioned Further Asus has a spotty record of working with the community and they are openly hostile to open source software communities I like what ally is bringing to the table but for now the deck is still the way to go I still play on my deck every day and a major part of it is that it just works I don't have to deal with windows
Agreed I was looking to buy an AM5 mobo and ASUS ones are by far the best value here in the UK Not anymore No chance
X570 1 000 boards produced then stopped makin
They did end up making a pricey x570 board that's apparently very good hopefully they'll make one for AM5 too before x870 or whatever is a thing
I wish EVGA would make GPU's
They announced it but the soonest we will see something is Q3 if any at all And begs the question if EVGA is still the same company as before
As someone with a three month old Strix X670E E with a 7900X and 32GB of DDR5 6000 RAM build this debacle has really made me question switching from Intel to AMD because I'd hoped to not have the trademark Intel socket abandonment garbage to contend only to have a potential ticking time bomb as the foundation of my rig Other than crashes when I initially built because Armory Crate is garbage and I had to reinstall Win10 I haven't experienced any problems running at EXPO II with AI Overclocking turned on Currently running the 1303 BIOS and can attest to the fact that despite what others here have said saw SoC running at 1 35 1 4V Where this video completely fails viewers is to show how to manually set the SoC voltage to a safe level something I picked up on Reddit I dialed that to 1 25V and things seem fine Why Tech Jesus felt spending a half hour bashing ASUS repetitively was beneficial and couldn't set aside 20 30 seconds to show how to take control of our systems until ASUS decides to not be scummy weasels is weak
Please ASUS work together with AMD to fix this issue so that I can utilize the advertised features of my 500 motherboard AMD fucked up with the CPU but they'd be insane if they'd give ASUS a pass for constantly trying to throw them under the bus throughout this single controversy alone
I got the same setup i manually set my SOC at 1 25 actually hovering around 1 264 1 280 and Expo is working nothing spikes above that i monitor that shit closely once they have a bios that actually is working properly that's not in beta ill go back on auto and keep expo for now manual is the way it seems
Have the exact same setup as you updated to the non beta bios so figured the issue should be resolved so turned on AMD expo for a few days got curious watching this video and noticed 1 28v SOC and other higher end voltages is my shit gonna be ok Still in the return window so could send it back
brand loyalty is stupid This debacle just proves that but also Asus blamed AMD for their strix cards for the 5700xt too
I have an E A and I just use EXPO II with 1 15 SOC voltage if it's on auto it's still under the AMD max at 1 24v
I've been sitting on 0805 since I got my board because every time I look at the forums talking about the new BIOS it's always a shit show
I got the same build Notice any issues my expo is turned off when i heard the news
People are getting 32gb and 64gb of ram working at 6400 stable Some are even running 128gb and 192gb at 5600 I myself am running 128gb on a 7950x3d on the x670e extreme
At least when I was getting ripped off by intel and nvidia the parts actually worked for longer than they'd even be relevant for In 30 years worth of computers I have had exactly 1 dead CPU which was my 4790K that died after 7 years of usage
Flashing 1303 on my Strix X670 E E didn't tame SoC voltages one damn bit contrary to what other Redditors have reported I manually set SoC to 1 25V and am frankly appalled that Tech Jesus spent a half hour calling ASUS scummy over and over but couldn't be arsed to set aside 20 30 seconds to show how we can take control of our systems to limit the SoC voltage rather than whine that ASUS isn't doing it automagically for us
Chances are you will be done with your CPU before it you won't know
MSI and Asrock are the only two I haven't heard of having an issue for with this They got official their bios updates out quickly as well Gigabyte on the other hand got chewed up in the first video on this GN put out
what's so bad about msi that you'd take em as the last option
I've been very happy with my aurus x670 elite ax Have had it since am 5 launch and have had 0 problems
Sell it on the used market did that with my Sabertooth boards
Which vendor I just returned mine to best buy outside of the window It was unopened and I explained what was happening with these boards
I got a ASUS ROG Strix X670E E Gaming and a 7800x3d 13 days ago off amazon can return for a month Should I Was running AMD expo with a 6000mhz cl 30 kit for a few days and noticed the high voltage something like 1 28v soc Should I worry about long term damage and return it or just run it with expo off
It is also a Gigabyte issue per GN's first video but for different reasons All the motherboard vendors are at some fault with AMD but Asus and Gigabyte were the worst
Why would AMD have released 2 AGESA when this issue was identified Second one actually locking down SoC s not just ASUS Also the whole omg the bios voids your warranty so does EXPO for both CPU and any MB
definitely not defiantly
Real world AMD vs Intel benchmarks D Crazy how far this went curious how AMD will deal with this
Asrock winning by simply doing nothing
No issues with my x670e steel legend knocks on wood
You sure
I'm knocking on wood I mounted a 7700x a month ago on a Rog strix x670e a mobo and gskill tridentz ram 2x16gb at 6000 mhz with DOCP II For now the soc voltages remain at 1 28
Right there with you Built a new PC just last month using a 7800x3D on an ASUS B650E F I did update there BIOS as soon as this all started
Gigabyte Asrock for now Every motherboard brand has issues but at least these ones aren t currently trying to screw people out of their warranty
Sadly not lots of good options
true but if you follow him on twitch twitter or watch older video he has been having a lot of issue with them thru
Because the ASUS board doesn't POST anymore
I 100 agree A lot of the in depth stuff is great but sometimes he repeats the same point too many times
Disagree I prefer it this way Plenty of over edited YouTubers out there GN s videos are well marked with sections it s easy to skip ahead if you want
If you want that just watch Linus Overly produced videos a half dozen tosses to buy his underwear line and a third of the information with a good chance of it being wrong GN is awesome because of the in depth analysis they go to It doesn't come across as a sitcom like other reviewers and by and large they're the most ethical and accurate on YouTube
Seems to depend a lot any nvidia strix model yes TUF GPU's are among the cheapest and absolute best options across the board though And it seems like there's at least one asus GPU firesale with each AMD generation
Be careful with MSI their UEFI signing keys are out in the wild and there's a lot of concern about how they're handling it Good article on Ars Technica if you're interested
Manually setting frequency also voids your warranty It also raises the soc voltage automatically
I watched it now They are comparing EXPO to JDEC Note you should not run either You can set frequency primaries and VSOC 1 2 and get better performance than Expo If you know what you are doing move on a set sub timings too Yes Asus should not push 1 35V on Expo but Expo still gives crapping timings and is better to manually set anyway
I have not watched My manual timings are being applied as reported in windows and perform much better than jdec
That's such a good value board I bought and returned one Glad I did now Shit ethernet controller plus being ASUS No thank you
What is your mobo Only see 1410 for X670E E
LMAO the executives never face the music
They made VERY solid motherboards pre 2012 After that they're just overpriced ECS motherboards
I think their Intel boards have been very good though no idea about 12 13th The Rocket Lake board on my 11900k build is incredible and it cost me the same as this cheap AM5 mobo from Gigabyte I have now while having way more ports dual Ethernet clear CMOS button QFLASH LED backup BIOS and being totally stable 365 24 7 with safe voltages and temps But I believe Intel provides very detailed specs to their partners and has very solid safeties built into their CPUs The mess we are in now is in good part AMD's fault
Like anything when its not corrupted by money and influence
Especially considering how much motherboards cost these days
I have a spare Z97 Extreme4 with 1 dead DIMM slot never worked seems to be a problem with their connector OEM if you still need that system to run
Yeah I got fucked by MSI hard back in the day
Because this isn't the only video they made on this topic nor is it the only one in general This video is a followup specifically to bash on ASUS
Because Asus deserve it
Nothing
Even if you avoid ASUS you should install the most up to date BIOS for the motherboard you select as soon as you set it up And keep checking for updates for a few months as the situation develops BIOS updates are rolling out to try to make sure voltages stay in the safe ranges from all manufacturers
I completed a build with B650E Taichi and a 7800X3D a few weeks ago now and have had no issues Got it to POST on first try during first boot and after enabling XMP Boot time is around 14s with 64gb 5600mhz CL30 RAM XMP on and SOC voltages never exceed 1 22V on the CPU or MOBO side Very happy with it so far As a note I flashed to the 1 21 bios during build before installing the CPU Just wanted to add a positive experience with AM5 instead of all the doom and gloom I would totally understand not wanting to proceed with an AM5 build nonetheless
Your best option for least risk is to get the Intel 13700k or the 5800x3d I'll be downvoted for sure But if you aren't a crazy enthusiast whom would tinker with your CPU every other day just do the above and sleep well knowing your PC is 99 999 not going to burn down on you unless you manually tweaked bios settings and no Im not talking about simple things like turning on XMP and turning on PBO but actually tweaking voltage and other enthusiast shit that gets them 5 more performance
I was looking at Gigabyte but they re oddly quiet on updates about this Maybe MSI
no probably wrong reading use HWINFO64 to monitor voltage
Send it back
Dont install the cpu until this blows over and there's a tested fully functioning bios Afterwards maybe consider waiting for followup coverage on Asus to see if you can trust them for motherboards in the future
Set VSOC manually to a lower value after you load expo then wait for an actually mature BIOS to arrive
It s defiantly a tough spot to be in I had a 13th gen setup and had issues with it I just couldn t reconcile so I went to a 7800X3D on a rog strix b650e f The performance of the board and cpu has been fantastic for the first two weeks After this video I m considering returning I m in my 2 week window and getting a new chip and MSI board I still prefer AM5
Asus is a brand recognized by non tech savvy people When non techie people think computers they think Asus mainly cause of decades of brand promotion Sure Asus used to be good 20 years ago doesn't mean they're worth it today
Honestly all the issues I ve had with 7000 series makes me regret upgrading to it from my 3800x instead of going Intel
499 motherboard that's expensive one It better support everything til am5 EOL
Why run expo Manual is easy and better
I have the x670 version Awesome board amazing overkill VRM cooling Who'da thought one of the budget x670 boards would be amongst the best
Care to share any stories
If it's any consolation I have the same motherboard and it's been great I use an older BIOS and EXPO enabled and there's no signs of anything wonky going on Never seen SoC voltage go any higher than 1 24V in HWInfo at least Been running this for about 3 months now
ASSus hasn't been good since 2012
Poor ASRock catching strays from Steve in this vid face with tears of joy cos someone online said the same
Just dont buy asus and stay inside the specs and there will be no issues
MSI Gigabyte and Asrock aren't voiding your warranty if you do a bios update or enable EXPO
More like Asus not renewing Jay for 2023 but instead of him being fired he quit and is using the recent drama to boost his clout
Unlikeable by corps for saying truth which is very likeable by customers
might want to provide context lol
Especially for the price Asus products are usually always in the higher range of the product line when it comes to price
this is what blind loyalty looks like
All your comments are about shitting on GN and defending AMD ASUS are you a shill Or just a hater I hope because otherwise what a sad fucking life my dude
18 42 Lies ASRock still has the old biosses up for 670E Steel Legend
The internet on average has the memory of a gold fish Don't Run Z490 Motherboards with Default Settings Thermals Power Boosting MCE for 10th Gen CPUs GamersNexus Gaming PC Builds Hardware Benchmarks
intel has same issue with mobos and cpu awhile
Not really related to CPU temperature you see in your OS
How about Asus installing caps on their Intel z690 backwards causing fires Not an Intel problem but a clear Asus QC issue which tends to fall in line with the current issue and why it seems to be mainly affecting Asus as well

Expo was always a easy but lose timing solution Manual was always better
I tested manually setting the frequency it raises my sic voltage to 1 38v I loaded bios defaults first and ut was at 1 05v set memory frequency to6000 and rebooted soc at 1 38v manual won't save you
Motherboard brands set SOC voltage too high which kills Ryzen X3D CPUs Recommended voltage is under 1 3v AMD release statement to tell their partners to lower the voltage through BIOs updates ASUS released several BIOs some of them don't work some of them work but also break other things No EXPO is one of the recommended solution which drops gaming performance by 15 Most importantly if you use their BIOS that fixes this problem you must agree to void your motherboard warranty What the heck you doing ASUS
What's the TLDR on this KABOOM
if the zen 4 incidents with soc voltages causing cpus and motherboards to spontaneously combust dont forget 13th gen is an option because the value proposition for the 13600k and 13700k is undenyable havent had any issues with my 7700x though im on bios 0805 with expo 1 on and soc voltages at 1 25v
Your trusting icue to report accurate voltages Icue is a bloated buggy mess that often reports nonsense because Corsair refuses to use the proper mutex to synchronize hardware polling requests The best thing you can do with icue is uninstall it If you want accurate reporting use HWINFO or AIDA or CPU Z Anything is better than icue
There's sort of two options The first is you can manually set your SOC voltage to 1 25V just to make sure the auto setting isn't setting it to some problematic value The second option depends on your specific ram If its hynix m die CL32 or lower then you can go the full manual route and get even better performance using buildzoids timings from this video v dlYxmRcdLVw text version is in the description We will eventually get proper BIOS updates to fix all this but its going to take a while which is probably a good thing You really don't want rushed BIOS versions and the reality is it's going to take time for AMD to properly update and rollout the new AGESA version and then the mobo vendors to update and hopefully thoroughly test their new versions
You also have the Riptide and Steel Legend as B650E X670E version
I doubt this whole warranty thing would even stand in a small claims court if it even got to that level You can't just as a company wife your hands clean because a user installed a bios update to fix a critical issue in your product Would probably just mean abit of fighting and what not But to answer the question well no if you were to install a non beta bios they wouldn't know that you had a beta bios on previously
MSI Gigabyte and Asrock aren't voiding your warranty if you do a bios update or enable EXPO
Already opened a return window on my Asus board and will be sending it back tomorrow Always bought Asus for years but it'll be a long time before i consider their motherboards again What baord did you get as a replacement
I got a ROG headset for free with my screen It's absolute garbage on every level but had no idea that was representative of all Asus products Looks like it is
I think I got lucky with my GPU No coil whine in my 3080 super
AMD ASUS products are potentially the worst
I got a monitor from them ROG PG279QZ dogshit design the only socket that supported the highest resolution and refresh rate blew up after a year of use leaving me with an expensive 1080p 60hz HDMI only gaming monitor
Anyone looking at specs has seen that clearly
Seems like ROG has become the new Alienware
I ve never seen this happen
I feel like this is fairly recent The Dark Hero x570 was a beast of a board
The week that i had my p67 asus board fail and fry my new cpu and the next day my couple hours new asus gtx670 top II also died i stop buying anything from asus
I agree
I never understood fanboy mentality I literally have all ASUS products on my last 2 builds mobo GPU Monitor my router and how they handled this is pissing me off to the point where I'll take my money somewhere else
The fun thing is they dont even sell more One particularly stupid child tried to tell me they sell 90 of motherboards like that is remotely believable let alone supported by evidence
I mean there may be some truth to that right Could be wrong but willing to bet that there are way more asus motherboards out there than other brands Would love to see some data on this
Saying that Asus sells mors isn't really railing you lol A lot of people were saying it was just Asus and Asus sucks and everything else and it's literally worth noting you'll see more reports from more voluminous products in the wild which is something that is disregarded and all the people ignored that just to actually slam Asus unfoundedly and now they're patting themselves on the back even though the way they got there was totally wrong anyway You have problems on all sides of these matters and it's kinda lame to sit there and pretend it's just fan boys and that you got railed by people pointing out a valid consideration Everyone runs wild with the fucking rumor mill and fear mongering so it's worth taking a step back to take a better look at things than knee jerk it all
I feel like I've been so out of the loop Granted I haven't built a PC in quite a while but ASUS was always solid from what I remember Eli5
The issue is that none of the brands these are truly good But Asus was for a long time the better one out there Now they are basically equally bad apart from this screw up for which they catch flack rightfully so
Never had anything but issues with Asus stuff and I've been building PC's for 30 years Always been an avoid for me Other companies fuck stuff up but Asus is always the one that tries to squirm out of anything and anything when it comes to RMA's and support Gigabyte and AsRock have served me well for many years Yes I've had some BIOS issues with Gigabyte once or twice a few years back but an email and usually something comes back to fix it within a week or so Abit used to be amazing the one company that was rock solid no matter what
What brand MB do you buy now
Tech Jesus gave them plenty of chances to come forward and fix their mess including an open interview They willingly ghosted him since probably their legal counsel thought it was a bad idea for liabilities I say they deserve ALL of the scorn plus more And the last two systems I built were asus one
I think after watching his channel for years he only gets hostile as a last resort when he's exhausted every avenue and his hostility is for the customers who don't have a platform and would get screwed over by a company like asus
Like pulling all the firmware It s probably the only quick way in their deployment setup to make them inaccessible Making firmware with a known hardware destroying bug inaccessible is the right move they don't have to let you download it They can block the downloads all they want without them trying to rewrite history big difference And they definitely shouldn't be telling you to update to the latest firmware then make a disclaimer that they aren't responsible for anything if you install it fuck Asus
I suppose Asus can just put a giant glaring disclaimer that the old BIOSes and firmwares are no longer supported due to the bug and require people to update to later ones
Nothing at all wrong with the disclaimer in my view The first part says it is a beta bios and Asus can't guarantee there are no issues with it because it is not fully tested of course it is a beta release The second part starts with Except as provided in the product warranty meaning the product warranty still applies
t 858 I presume they are referring to the marketed EXTREME ENGINE DIGI CONTROLLER OMFGPERFECTPOWERDELIVERY which Asus claims is on their board to finely control all the power phases since voltages applied are actually higher than what is reported to the system see the bios screens vs the actual multimeter measurement in the video and the OCP does not protect form a short
Try to guess why
ASUS We won t send you our stuff GN Ok Hey everyone This is how ASUS does business Here s the receipts Don t buy ASUS ASUS Surprised Pikachu
ASUS I am not scared of anything Also ASUS Please dont send our stuff to GN Steve is scary
Was that in the video Edit do the down votes mean yes or no
The fact it runs windows and now Asus says they partnered with Microsoft for the Ally and will not say if it can run Linux at all makes me think it s not a nice piece of hardware Asus has been churning out crap AMD mobo for years now I ve had trouble with the TuF Sabertooth 990FX dead audio CODEC on arrival actually had to return the board twice to finally receive a working one and TuF X470 Plus Gaming mobo intermittently freezes at boot screen if you have 6 hard drives hooked up in RAID Asus refuses to do anything about it that I ve switched to Gigabyte then Asrock
About that
So wait you changed the CPU and its Asus fault
Steve and co operating independently is precisely the reason why they can do the reporting they do If it was a company like Linus they'd have to abide by NDAs and kiss corporation asses all the time while pretending nothing is wrong or even openly shill for shit products
Their anti static mat is awesome and very useful
I second the coasters Very quality and I use them all the time
In fairness a part of the reason that GN can do reporting like this is because people pay them and buy their stuff The 'fall' of investigative journalism is pretty much in lockstep with the rise of online news and everyone expecting their news to be free which itself is a tricky problem to tackle because even if you have the best intentions and charge a fair price there's always someone else out there Murdoch who will be happy to give away news for free some strings attached
I spent 10 on my desk pad mouse pad from some generic brand It s lasted years without fray or curling etc have the pads on multiple desks just simple solid black It speaks nothing of a company if they sell some incredibly cheap product that just gets their branding printed on it lol Just understand the only thing you paid for is branding and picture printed on the pad Mouse pads are an incredibly simple cheap mass produced product Only wireless charging or hard surface pads are worth a premium IMO Otherwise 5 12 is enough
2022 Disappontment Tour shirt is comfy
I ordered the screwdriver set to ship to Canada the shipping was not too bad but after considering that and duty taxes it got pretty expensive I won't be buying more but I wanted to show my thanks for this piece of coverage in particular
You can always subscribe to their patreon even if it's only for a few months
Yeah they really go above and beyond with their testing methods
Who is the least worst AT THE MOMENT Which is the problem A few years ago ASUS was still king and no one else was releasing BIOS updates quickly or long term MSI had quality issues and ASRock was OK but not great Every few years those roles all switch GB started doing better BIOS updates MSI for quality under control ASRock upped their game And now ASUS has been dropping the ball for a fee years It's likely all cyclical management BS Team does well margins go down costs go up new team brought in to cut costs quality and reputation goes down revenue goes down now bring back good management to fix reputation Repeat
When people care more about money than quality or reputation that's capitalism Because when it comes down to it reputation and quality require money to maintain and capitalism says that to make the cheapest possible product those extra costs have to be removed It was inevitable that tech brands are burning customers to make shareholders happy
Just choose based on reviews and prices of individual products not who makes them That said between my own negative experience with an Asus monitor and their long documented scummy behavior I don't see myself buying their products at all anytime soon
Word for word my comment
Asrock aren't really better EVGA should get in the AMD mobo game
Everyone is bad Pick your poison
Enjoy them evga psus
So far my ASRock boards have been perfect I don't see myself getting a different motherboard any time soon
Asus and Asrock are both owned by the company Pegatron
I wish Corsair would start making motherboards
Asrock and asus are owned by the same parent
What did gigabyte do TL DR
Don't forget about ol' Biostar I have a couple of their boards including a B450 and haven't had any issues with them
Gigabyte and MSI are scummy too in their own way
Am biggest fan of Asus TUF motherboards have 7 of those 3 in my rigs and work fine
Just so you know I had the same BIOS update doesn't actually apply a 1 3v limit thing on my gigabyte B650 elite ax using F5c which is the latest bios available on the support page at this point in time and claims to fix it
They're almost as bad too They deleted all their old BIOSes putting out BIOSes then deleting them with no reason And their BIOSes have been super buggy not fixing the issue When someone reached out to customer service for a reason CS said The BIOSes are no longer supported and use at your own risk Just ask scummy
That's the problem When I looked for an AM5 board the B650E E from ASUS was the closest to what I wanted in terms of features and I O for a relatively cheap price I also read about the manufacturers in general and read about a problem with an MSI board where one PCIe slot straight up doesn't work at all not on one specific board but on all boards of that model and they didn't fix it via BIOS updates even months after release I had own experiences with an ASRock AM4 board that was the most unstable system I had in a long time Sure might just be a problem I experienced because of my CPU RAM and PCIe devices combo or whatever but that pretty much made me exclude ASRock for my next purchase And so 't know what it was with Gigabyte but Biostar doesn't really have a wide selection of boards and I read bad things about memory compatibility memory OC capabilities As I had good experiences with two AM4 ASUS boards X370 Crosshair VI Hero and ROG Strix B550 E and the B650E E does everything I want I went ASUS again Now I feel kinda meh about my purchase but to be honest after some long POST time issues which are now resolved it pretty much just works for me The only reason I feel meh now is because of the way ASUS is handling this situation In an ideal world I'd want a board that skips on all this gaming branding crap has a simple text based BIOS UI comes with lots of I O PCIe NVMe USB and focuses on stability reliability and compatibility But it's either super limited office PC boards or gaming branding crap boards ASUS' ProCreate or whatever boards are basically gaming boards with a different BIOS skin
I'll probably give gigabyte a try
I hope you don't believe that Asus is the only capable company out
rock solid Until half their boards blew up due to faulty caps
Man I miss them too I'm at the stage in my life where I just want as few possible problems from my boards No cosmetics just high quality components good VRMs stability and support
Didn t Abit go under because of class action suits over their use of dogshit capacitors
DFI LanParty Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time
You just awoke a core memory Man those boards were great and they looked really cool at the time too
OMG I remember saving up money going to Frys and finally scoring my DFI LanParty Nforce4 board and running my 7600gtx in SLI through a 50 1080p flatscreen I thought it was the pinnacle of gaming
100 agree I don't think I ever owned a board with the level of overclocking capabilities and features as what DFI were pushing out back in the early 2000s Everything could be tuned every timer could be modified every voltage was available every multiplier was unlocked It was beautiful
Ahh good old days Loved the color schemes as well
Back when the pcb were really cool looking colors too
I had a DFI board with my Athlon 64 3800
Yeah but their boards are 2x price of anything in the same category They only have high end ln2 boards basically
EVGA is understood to a bit of a lost cause on the publicity and innovation side with EVGA Jacob having been let go or rather left on his own terms I have been the longest speculator for an X670 Kingpin lol
Maybe EVGA but they are very limited at this point and kind of boutique Everyone one else seems to be trash in one way or another
Try 1000 for just the motherboard
it shouldn't have out of the box issues that will slowly destroy both slowly In GN's first video on this issue you can literally hear the die crack after only a few minutes
what about vapor gate 110c is normal operating 't and suddenly there was a issue
Or at the very least the issues should 100 be covered by a warranty There are always going to be issues in any of these hardware segments
But that's a source of confusion in and of overclocking do you mean full manual or turning on EXPO They're the same thing apparently
While AMD did fuck up some here with the SOC voltages not being investigated recommended lower to motherboard manufacturers prior to this shitshow Source
if you mean a very small percent has experienced catastrophic failure that's probably true but the nature of the damage appears to be cumumulative and slient until it reaches a critial point that results in the catastrophic failure so it's hard to say how widespread the issue is
You should make a guess on how long you're planning to hold onto that system If you plan to upgrade the CPU in a gen or two later then AMD is still worth a consideration That's my current plan ever since I side graded my 5800X3D for a 7600 I'm going in with the expectation that I'm one of those suckers who won't be able to resist upgrading There's a lot of exciting things in the pipeline rn especially in regards to AI I bet next gen is going to be a banger for both 14th gen and zen5 In regards to the board vendors MSI built their entire rep on AM4 starting from the B450 era in my eyes they're the most reliable out of the bunch Bad idea to switch just for the sake of it From my recent experiences Gigabyte has a buggy bios profile system If they're affected then it's highly likely going to originate from step 1 load up an old saved preset from an different bios revision I wouldn't trust ASRock on anything as they come from the exact tree as ASUS once did In the AM4 era they blacklisted reviewers HUB when they reviewed their lower end board If you're outraged about ASUS then there's little reason to consider ASRock Intel has its own issues too from their mounting mechanism and the main negative fact is their platform is EOL Fanboys will try their damn best to gaslight and make you think AM5 socket support won't be supported for long etc But looking back AMD is the only vendor who supports their platforms to death You could even use an AM2 cooler on AM5 if you really wanted to The only good thing about Intel is you can use DDR4 and they have a better video encoder on their chip So if either of these points are advantageous consider Intel especially if you're a content creator Redditors are an overly dramatic bunch People making statements such as a nuclear bomb going off makes me laugh For the vast majority of AM5 owners they simply haven't been affected If you're overly concerned you the precautionary measure would be to simply turn off EXPO and limit VSOC The funny thing is turning off EXPO XMP matters little in most games so long as you're not playing on 1080p Once you play at 1440p or 4K resolution the gap greatly narrows down
With all of this going on I would go Intel if I were you I have a 12900k and don't have to worry about a nuclear bomb going off in my room Using a high end asus mobo btw not a single issue with it at all Most stable system I have ever built
There is Several laws in fact
India it was during peak covid and i couldn't even get it repaired so i caved and bought a new one Even if i want to try to apply for consumers protection its not worth the hassle at the end if the day
Back when Nvidia made the controller on the mobo and made it with a defect which affected everyone in the chain
I've been building computers professionally for 21 years The lesson is not to have blind brand loyalty And read watch reviews All these companies have up and down periods for the quality of their products
Thats low Imagine putting out a beta to cover your bases with a disclaimer it voids your warranty if you chose to use it I can forsee all future bioses for current am5 boards from ASUS being beta to try and avoid liability Cunts
This disclaimer is preventing me flashing my bios Not taking chances with new bugs
Bought mine as part of a package
No shortage of people that still defend ASUS's brands like Strix Seems crazy to me to spend an extra 200 on a TUF or 400 on a Strix 4090 that has the same odds of coil whine as any other brand's base model Even the base model Gigabyte cards have an extra year of warranty coverage too
I have an ROG Phone and it still was getting updates as of a year ago 3 years of software updates isn't great but it's definitely better than what most people have been saying That said would I buy another one No The software is terrible and I can't even update my phone because the updater broke let alone all the other things that barely function I've also had terrible experience with Asus's warranty I paid 80 to RMA my 2080 Ti and received a replacement with a very similar issue and completely dry thermal paste It wasn't even refurbished
To be fair for a lot of these tertiary phone brands like RedMagic ASUS they have a single team and it's fully expected by both customer manufacturer that if you want the new fixes software updates whatever you buy the new phone That's why they release every incremental update as a new device like clockwork IMHO ASUS even does this wrong they're priced like they last forever built to last the length of the warranty and even then get delayed months before release to any market outside of Asia Everyone else figured out disposable phone means disposable pricing
Zenfone Max Pro M1 promised Android 10 left with Beta that need to be installed manually The hardware is good I have no reason to switch phone but that half assed Beta update annoy me to no end
Yeah I just want an AM5 board
They still are and honestly with how the 40 series turned out to be I'd be more impressed with EVGA since they clearly made the right call to end that partnership
Check out buildzoids new video Gigabyte and other posters fot ASUS showing that there mb sometimes just completely ignore your configured VSOC settings and shoot 1 4 VSOC into the rail Worst part is sometimes the board will report 1 3v and the actual rail is shoveling 1 4v when measured with a scope ASUS
If your running 32gb at 6000 it should work at 1 1 to 1 15 soc I have 128gb running at 1 2v it was running at 1 1 before but I decided to increase the Infinity Fabric by 100Mhz so I uped it to 1 2v
He did it in a previous video about exploding x3d chips But I still agree I expected an update pr at least a reference to that video
Do you have that video to link I ve got an ASUS ROG STRIX B650 A 7900x 32GB 6000mhz RAM I ll have to double check my bios but I am running EXPO Last thing I would want is my newly built system two months ago and 4090FE going down My last build had an ASUS Z87 Sabertooth hah
Hi I just received the 7950x3d Am concerned with all the issues and reported problems here from users Do you think I should just return the cpu back for a refund
What You can set whatever manually on whichever board on whichever bios However that's not normal and shouldn't be required to not fry the chip and board If you think just set it manually is the solution here you clearly don't understand the issue
I hope that's how it goes I'm definitely pretty concerned about it now Not exactly how I thought going team red was going to be
GB have put out a bios that fixes any high voltage issues At least on my x670
I was having a Convo with a guy on YT He has a MSI board and his computer died to this issue within a few days of building his computer I have MSI myself but so far no issue in the last 3ish weeks so far since my build news broke out at the same time
Wouldn't it be just screwing some random guy just not as educated in this situation
Yes return it starting the current issues and get a board from one of the better brands
When has a BIOS ever needed to cap a voltage before In the past if a chip manufacturer capped voltage there would be riots over it it's my CPU let me do what I want with it etc AMD only had to do it because the mobo manufacturers fucked up their default behaviour so much
You re defiantly an officer police officer Thanks for pointing out my typo
I had to manually set my SoC voltage to 1 25V on my X670E E 7900X 32GB DDR5 6000 build on BIOS 1303 the last non beta version because it was still running 1 35V 1 4V EXPO II settings
Is it though I thought it's just most common in the 3D chips
no its not debauer had a fried 7900X from months ago the X3D are just more likely to have it happen
There were at least 2 reports of a 7600X and a 7900X burning in a similar way It's not exclusive it's just more common with the X3D due to them being more voltage sensitive especially with ASUS mobos Their OCP is just super high and any any CPU will burn if it encounteres abnormaly high voltage and the OCP refuses to work
It's not though it's related to all EXPO Your CPU won't fry like the X3D line but for instance my Corsair Dominator Platinum won't even clock to 5400 when the clock speed advertised with EXPO is 6000
Yes and he went over all the issues in his video along with many others His streaming pc motherboard was bricked by a bios update similar to my X670 Hero board was
Emotional Damage
Critical hit
Nice wordplay
Burnnnn
Oof
I think the videos are the best but sometimes even if I just have it on in the background it puts me to sleep Don't need the Linus BS 't add value in being said again If it was said in a different way that could help people understand better that would be one thing but it really doesn't Its like a teacher just trying to fill up time until the end of class Again it has become my main channel for tech stuff as the others all have glairing issues while this is solid
As mentioned that doesn t help because he ll repeat the 1st section again in the 2nd and so on and so forth
A good editor will help you get all the info you want out there to your audience with the least amount of words That's all not the other stuff you mentioned It's also something you are taught when writing peer reviewed work which is incredibly indepth I love Gamers Nexus but I'd agree I think there are times they could benefit from an editor or at least trying one out That all being said I also don't think it's a big deal if he doesn't hire one Gamers Nexus places a priority on spending their budget in ways to get us more information through additional avenues of testing which is a huge reason I watch them over others But at some point it is important to think about how said information is conveyed
Im not talking about cutting information or detail Im talking about when the segment continues to talk about the same thing with no additional meaningful information Also so so so many times when he uses 4 8 words when 1 3 words would accomplish the EXACT same meaning
GN is certainly a better deep dive and technical source than LTT but saying LTT information has a good chance of being wrong is just not true They ve put out bad info in the past and have always quickly rescinded and corrected once it was found same as GN but they certainly never made a habit of bad info The habit of bad info award should go to JayzTwoCents in my opinion GN for technical deep dives on equipment I believe they are second to none on the quality and depth of this work LTT for more surface level technical info but more emphasis on Infotainment and just wacky shit Hardware Unboxed for their ridiculously huge benchmark samples though I know they angered people with Survivor coverage Paul s hardware for a more casual source etc etc
You're missing the point the extra length isn't adding to the depth It's repetition
Not running with EXPO is about a 17 reduction in performance taking the 7700X from trading blows with the 13600K to being about 7 better than the i3 12100F for 240 more triple the price
Probably b650 My B650E I has 1413 and 1414 also 1602 as the latest beta bios
Tuf gaming x670e plus Wi Fi
Cost has gone up quality has gone down way down way down LOW Kinda like fastfood
And viewers don't deserve advice on how to protect themselves Got it It'd be like making a half hour video screaming about how all the prostitutes in New Orleans have STDs and then not suggesting for 20 seconds to either wrap that rascal or consider not sticking it into diseased places in the first place Because hookers deserve it
But asus said all ryzen 7000 cpus users should update their bios Which i don't wanna do
I was looking at Gigabyte but they re oddly quiet on updates about this Their latest bios does address this Follow AMD guidance to limit max SOC voltage to 1 3V for Ryzen 7000 series X3D and non X3D CPUs Certain EXPO XMP memory performance may be impacted due to this change Source support dl bios
I run expo with Buildzoids manual timings That same config on later bios versions didn't work for me wouldn't even post
But the facts are that Ive made 3 beautiful personal builds on Asus since 2012 X79 Sabertooth Dark Hero and now x670e extreme I recently gave away the Sabertooth and I still have the other 2 The 7950x3d on the extreme board performs as a 24 core 5000 series Threadripper running 128gb if ram
They're about to lose millions from customers no longer buying their trash
That gn fan base in a nut shell
This video is what witch hunting hysteria looks like AND GN is fishing for memberships because everyone loves witch hunting the
My bad i should not use ALL on this case BUT it is standard practice to remove bios that ODM thinks are not supposed to be public In another mulitverse some other Steve with tricks up his sleeve will praise Asus and Gigabyte for quick response to remove 1 3v soc bios from their support page
I don't know how you can compare that to this though because chips weren't combusting and bending pins Also could you imply that the issue in that case was Intel's bios Nope
There is nothing wrong with the 12vhpwr plug It's caused by people not knowing how to insert it correctly Been using it since release on several 4090's and it's pretty easy to get a cable from modDIY or Cablemod
Assuming HWinfo isn't lying to me my soc has never bypassed manual and sticks at 1 15v as I set it What motherboard do you have Heard some other motherboard manufacturer didn't listen to the bios settings Edit I leave hwinfo running any time my pc is on and check it from being idle and multiple games it's never changed the SOC on me personally
Thanks I'll check those out
I think I will go MSI instead Still checking the options Hopefully their mobos are more stable
I've never used anything but Asus in my personal builds and have continued to support that decision by trying out other companies when I build for other people besides trash software I have always felt that they were the best quality at the price point I was at I am surprised by this general sentiment and curious to know which company the hive recommends
Never get the gaming branded part if a normal version is available and there is no clear benefit headsets chairs keyboard sound card network card monitors because default ones usually have only 60 hz refresh rate mouse more choice but not really
Asus For those who dare
Tbf most gaming headsets are pretty garbage ROG or not
I'd say many headphones of similar gaming brands are overpriced in relation to normal brand headphones
their network gear is pretty nice and zenfone 9 looks good 8
I think it s fine to prefer a product but ignoring facts to push a product just because you prefer them is illogical and harmful
It's about feeling that they made the right choice picking that brand over another It makes them feel good that other people also approve of that brand They develop such an attachment that they see criticism as an attack on themselves They are basically defending themselves and using the brand as a proxy
the numbers from 2022 AM4 were in 2022 these are the numbers for AM4 in millions Asus 13 6 Gigabyte 9 5 MSI 5 5 Asrock 6
They've been going downhill for quite a while now Like i think it was 2 years ago one of their Z690 boards had to be recalled after a whoel debacle of it literally catching fire They never handled that situation too well And then there's the whole Ryzen 7000 burning debacle Admittedly all boards have been affected here but Asus seems to have messed up the most with their board nit having adequate protections etc in place and pumping ridiculously high voltage And now they're issuing a beta bios to fix the issue which it still doesn't and putting a disclaimer about them not taking any responsibility with the use of a beta bios Basically trying to wash their hands clean
My latest was an MSI X570 MAG Wifi Return to Honor Don't get me wrong MSI has been just as bad But this X570 MAG board has the best power delivery for under 500 on the market This board seemed like a refutation apology from them so I didn't mind rewarding it
Absolutely They have proven that they know what they re doing they deserve all of the criticism
Oh I get that I also think he's raking them over the coals extra hard because of the fact the fixed bios is still broken on top of their misguided poorly executed attempt to save face
That really depends on how shit their website implementation is and based on my use of it I'm going with significantly steamy pile of shit
That was my read on it Basically they don t warrant the firmware Meaning if it doesn t work for you you can t claim loss of use and such But they will warrant the board if it bricks the board There s still plenty to complain about but I think that bit is very overblown
Someone should make the TF2 Heavy meme with this
Watch it It's literally the thread
Asus use to own asrock as a heads up so i wouldnt be surprised if asrock has similar practices I mean asrock did nfts after all
Asrock And that's saying something Asrock has really turned their brand image around in 10yrs ASUS is now in a worse position than Asrock was 10yrs ago today
The hardware is probably great But supporting Linux will likely mean they have to do more driver development and validation in terms of stability and so on which they're not willing to do I assume they have business reasons for going about it this way but I do feel like it's a missed opportunity
That's some FUD right there Yeah don't download updates from sketchy websites This doesn't change that if anything it reinforces it
Have you not heard of Asus boards overvolting the cpus I highly doubt my cpu worked for 3 weeks just fine and passed all benchmarks and than all of a sudden became faulty The likely culprit was my Asus board overvolting without my knowledge
Independently not independent imo That is the danger with no accountability because of his status This video goes gun blazing with the scumbag claims but every points laid out have been flakey and biased I am not Asus boot licker but when i see someone acting holier than thou using a slant i call Steve out Here's to Steve from another reply i made Your video start off with pure FUD conjecture and then continue to use bombastic blame game SOC This is on Amd it was VDIMM VSOC Turn on EXPO leave SOC on Auto increase DDR speeds SOC auto increase up to a then AMD cap of 1 4v 3 33 how is it possible you cannot post with load optimised default This has to be bullshit and fake 5 40 compares Hero to non OC Answer 5 45 your measurement is at the socket MLCC There will be voltage drop before it reaches CPU die What are your LLC levels at 8 20 Asus has release beta bios with this disclaimer before even this hooha It is for those who want to make use of latest to play test 11 48 ALL AM5 boards had cpu voltage adjustment enabled this is AMD Agesa oversight until DER8AUR killed a 7950X3D Amd told all their partners to hide Cpu voltage for X3D afterwards 16 29 what is wrong with this disclaimer EXPO does not mean your CPU can run at EXPO speed 18 42 ALL AM5 partners remove their older bios Why you single Asus out For your hooha no Steve you have not come back to explain how OCP is supposed to work on AM5 How much did Asus undershoot their OCP for their Hero board What were you bios setting when you intentionally killed that 7800X3D
It's not about obtaining the highest quality per dollar product When you buy stuff from a company such as Gamers Nexus or LTT or any other reputable tech outlet it's because you're choosing to support them specifically Any informed customer who buys a product from these outlets should already be aware that what they're going to receive is a product that most would agree is of an acceptable standard and be aware that a portion of the price tag stems from the fact that the company is doing this service to make ends meet These guys are doing well within their niche but they aren't Apple of Microsoft pulling 25 35 profit margins year over year More than likely they're operating within 7 12 margin and in a much smaller market That's why they sell branded merch
Your 10 mouse mat might not have worn or frayed badly but I'm sure a lot of them have I had two desk pads like that which wore out within a year before I bought my GN mat and it has been going for twice that length of time with zero issues Sometimes you get lucky with cheap shitty products that isn't a testament to the overall quality it's just you being lucky
Every few years those roles all switch GB started doing better BIOS updates MSI for quality under control ASRock upped their game And now ASUS has been dropping the ball for a fee years You're the first person I've seen mention this I've been in this hobby since the late nineties so I've seen it happen over and over again Same thing with Dell HP and Lenovo Once they get on top they start cutting corners everybody moves to another brand and the cycle starts over again
Big facts It's all cyclical Every manufacturer seems to go through a series of good and bad boards It's how the company presents itself in the face of the downward cycle that matters Sadly Gigabyte had their PSU's they swindled MSi had their direct sale issue and their horrible PR bribing And now Asus with
EVGA is consistently the best Remember during the GPU shortage they were the only manufacturer to provide a simple queue Easy as fuck to implement but no one else gave a single fuck about their customers except EVGA They have good RMA and do more than everyone else Mistakes happen and they aren't immune to that but at least they fix theirs EVGA is solid
I despise how shareholders only care about short term profit We all suffer they loot everything we suffer again
I remember that this
What s wrong with ASRock I gave them a shot this gen first since X99 loved that one too and it s awesome
Get back in the game EVGA produced a X570 FTW and a Dark mb but nada now Furthermore wish EVGA partnered with AMD on video cards
Aren't EVGA boards made either by asrock pegatron or foxconn
Made by FSP or HEC
They aren't Asus split into 3 companies in 2008 then in 2010 pegatron was spun off i to a separate company entirely there are no longer any business connections or shared ownership between the 2
Idk they are not that good only psus are good
no you really really don t
This is not correct it is more complicated asus split into 3 different companies in 2008 then pegatron was spun off as a seperate business in 2010 there is actually no connection between asus and asrock anymore
Garbage warrenty support plus motherboards eating cmos batteries
There were the exploding PSU issues that had broken OPP protections that were up to 150 of the rated wattage of the PSU which is way higher than it should ever be for any PSU These protections did not protect the PSU since it would only work for a single shutdown and a 2nd shutdown could happen at under the rated PSU wattage and result in a pop and sparks Protections should kick in before any damage to the PSU occurs so it very much should not have passed basic internal testing These PSUs were forcefully bundled with RTX 30 series cards during the shortage and 30 series cards had very high power spikes that could overload PSUs if there wasn't enough capacitance to handle the small spiky surges Instead of shutting down it would just pop and die possibly bringing other components down with it Newegg reviews of the PSU before tech media picked it up were already extremely negative so this problem was ignored until Gigabyte was backed into a corner Gigabyte's initial response after a GN video was it only happens with unrealistic artificial loads in lab testing for extended periods of time which wasn't true They later offered replacements but only after a few videos of Gamersnexus calling them out for all the BS they have been doing Also before this specific PSU issue got picked up by tech channels Newegg originally would not accept partial returns of bundles or for any lottery bundle during the shortage so you would have to give up your MSRP GPU if you had issues Gigabyte Newegg did start up an exchange RMA thing but that was later A friend got an RTX 3070 PSU bundle and I had to help him RMA it I'm mostly going off of memory here so this may not be 100 correct but it should be pretty close There was also the ransomeqare attacks that caused them to lose some RMA tickets some returned RMA cards being marked as delivered but gigabyte claims to never have gotten it leaving people with nothing Vega56 64 cards having underbuilt PCBs that crashed at stock voltage clocks currently their AM5 bios do not properly reset voltages to AUTO or always apply plus some other stuff with customer service Right now most companies seem to be like this so it is best to order through Amazon Bestbuy Microcenter where returns are pretty easy and hope that you never need an RMA But for now I have lost all interest in the new Asus handheld even if the performance blows the steam deck out of the water
They just aren't available as retail boards in most countries unfortunately mostly north america south east asia and eastern europe with a few spots in between
Right but I think our options are who is the least scummy at this point lol
the whole PC industry is scummy as fuck
I'd rather have marketing be scumbags than the hardware be scum
I have used mostly asrock mobos and a few MSI over the last decade and i never had a single issue with them ever
It depends on the year Remember the people that work at Asus now will be working somewhere else tomorrow Maybe MSI or Gigabyte
AsRock then lol
ASUS' ProCreate or whatever boards are basically gaming boards with a different BIOS skin Gigabyte did a Aero D for Z690 that had that basic overall featureset they didn't do one for Z790 or AM5 that I've seen but feature wise it was very similar to the ProArts from ASUS x200B that aside I did buy and return an Aero D Z690 because it killed three kits of DDR5 which is unfortunate because it really is a unique board and further on AMD Gigabyte has the best record for memory compatibility stability and not exploding CPU
In an ideal world I'd want a board that skips on all this gaming branding crap has a simple text based BIOS UI comes with lots of I O PCIe NVMe USB and focuses on stability reliability and compatibility But it's either super limited office PC boards or gaming branding crap boards ASUS' ProCreate or whatever boards are basically gaming boards with a different BIOS skin Quite literally where I'm at I'm surprised there hasn't been a company yet that says screw this to all that gaming branding and bullshit software
My gigabyte b650m aorus elite ax has been handling my 7800x3d system with no issues at all Gigabyte seems like a good go this generation
If you are on a budget I heartwarmingly can recommend the B650E X670E Riptide and Steel Legend
I m just asking don t really like Gigabyte MSI bioses are meh
To be fair sub par caps were a HUGE issue across the entire electroncis industry for a few years because one main capacitor manufacturer switched to a low quality electrolyte
I just learned two days ago that Abit no longer exists lol
Yellow and black like a bumble bee I loved my DFI mine was an AMD Athlon64x2 6000 was a great system wish they still made the NFORCE chipset it was amazing width 417 format png auto webp v enabled s 28784297ce6db667dc2aa59a17b446ff78d11f6b
Ill do one better Soyo KT400 Platinum Dragon That was the blingmaster king till DFI got going Abit was my jam
Had the same board Peake pc gaming era for me Upgrading for Doom 3
Exactly Gonna upgrade my system CPU RAM MOBO soon from my 8700K plenty happy with my RTX 3080 Have a wishlist for both a ryzen and intel upgrade 7700X and i7 13700K Price difference is small enough that its not a deciding factor for me But I want to get a dif brand mobo than MSI since my current and last one are were Just like to try dif brands But obv not going with ASUS for now anyways And yea I checked the EVGA boards on newegg for the intel option Cheapest is 650 Way more than I'm willing to spend on a motherboard 200 to about 300 tops sure
I mean those boards are mostly scam to begin with except for few extreme overclocking boards And if you want those I'd go to EVGA
Which was found to be a manufacturing defect and everyone who had an affected card got a RMA Asus here is claiming that using the fixed bios will void your warranty so if this new bios breaks your motherboard and CPU you'll be fucked
Anything that runs the CPU out of official specifications is considered overclocking including XMP and EXPO This has always officially been the case for both AMD and Intel
Every single motherboard manufacturer had bios that let vsoc go up above 1 3 with their early bios prior to this issue Which after this became a problem the AMD recommendation is vsoc not going past 1 3
so it's hard to say how easy
Thank you very much for the detailed helpful post And yea I'm totally open to going intel or AMD when I upgrade my system minus GPU like I said plan on my 3080 lasting 2 3 more years I am going to make the jump to DDR5 so Intel supporting both DDR4 and 5 dosen't make a difference to me Neither dose the quicksync video encoding I believe that's the brand name of it This system is just for gaming really and just browsing the web watching YT etc I get what you mean about not switching brands for the heck of it Though my MSI board dose have some annoyances IDK if newer MSI boards have these quirks but there are mainly two that annoy me First would be that in ability to restore BIOS settings after a BIOS update Even accidently entering flashing mode and leaving it clears the BIOS and causes the other issue get to that in a sec I def get what you mean about it being best for reliability to not let you restore a profile from a previous version It's just knowing that other vendors support exactly that is a bit of a bummer I also like Gigabytes Smart Fan 6 I think and how you can save your fan profiles to a file Would be nice if my MSI board would at least let me restore those settings after a update I just took photos of every screen in the BIOS setup to remember my settings Now the second issue Anytime you update BIOS or again simply enter the flashing mode it will break any RAID array you have setup I have a RAID 0 array of two 3 TB HDD's I use it for things like old games that don't really benefit from being on a SSD and for parking games Like using steam xbox app pc gamepass etc to move a game I'm not playing at the moment to that 6 TB's of storage and move the game back to one of my two NVME drives Thank goodness however it doesn't destroy the array It's actually very easy and quick to completely restore it with no data loss But I had to do some googling to find a random forum post somewhere with directions to fix it Also quick question Dose this issue ONLY apply to the 7800X3D thought I heard that somewhere IDK Because if I so if I do go AMD I'm getting the R7 7700X
You should still register a complaint on the consumer forum Even though you have taken the loss companies should not be allowed to get away with such things Also the consumer forum has a good amount of positive reviews You'll just need your bills and photos of the box and product
Mine simply stopped working for 2ghz band within a year I did not even tinker and would notice the 2ghz dropping often until it fully dropped Service centre said they won't provide replacement or refund instead would repair it and give back in 3weeks That was last year and after many calls I just gave up hopes of getting anything back I had done this offline so I can't prove the exchange took place It was legit Asus center and had previously fixed my phone there I can't provide any suggestions I just make do with the ISP router now all of them are sus in some way or the other Maybe I'll go for openWRT on a raspberry pi or something if I need top features
it voids your warranty if you chose to use it Steve also implied this in the video but i kinda doubt it is what the text says It seems to be a fairly standard wording for a beta release no warranty on the software because it hasn't been tested enough internally for that but this isn't related in any way to the product's warranty nor does it void that warranty If i find some time i'll write a proper contextualized question on r AskALawyer as i'm not a lawyer myself it shouldn't hurt asking those who practice
This is why except for a brief detour to OnePlus for their One and 2 phones the latter was a huge disappointment and was rapidly replaced I've been running Nexus Pixel phones since 2012 Nexus 4 5 6P Pixel 3XL 6 7 Pro So many things I take for granted which are exclusive to El Goog's phones
Three years is abominable when you compare it to Apple's seven and Apple aren't exactly famous for being consumer friendly Is three years of updates really considered tolerable by Android people
I watched the first video of the series but skipped the 2nd because GN videos don't playback at 2X on my TV without sound issues Digital Foundry has the same issue He also spends too much time on numbers and repetitive things because he doesn't script tightly like Linus does They should make a one minute video showing how to set SoC and link it to all their exploding videos since it's such an existential threat to our systems Riling up people that they got hosed by ASUS may prevent future sales but those of us with these boards NOW need relief other than rage
What video are you referring to If you mean where did I see to manually dial in SoC it was a comment on a thread here either in the AMD or ASUS subs
S that's not what I'm saying I'm saying that until ASUS stops fucking around with broken BIOS which have use this to void your warranty disclaimers and puts out something that actually addresses the problems people should know how to manually change the setting causing the problem It's not meant to be a permanent fix but a stop gap pending a proper BIOS If someone breaks their leg hiking in the woods would you be demanding that no one splint them up with branches and bandanas because that's no replacement for a proper cast Sounds like you would
Ya all boards were impacted just some worse than others I'm going to update the bios the first time I turn it on here
Keep it until the official Bios is out update it sell it You're no longer screwing over a random person
As the product is faulty return it
cpu too
AMD only had to do it because the mobo manufacturers fucked up their default behaviour so much The difference here is the fragility of these new chips especially x3d with its cache It's just kinda growing pains imo edit And I don't mean they are fragile because they are bad just new tech
Interesting thanks
Der 8auer fried a 7900x
As a 7700x user myself I have not seen a single report of a non x3d chip burning
i know about that one video 1 other one to i try to follow as much as possible but some times video etc new ones for channel i sub to dont show up as recently added
Thanks but it's not mine It was a joke beaten to death back when ASUS used to have a bad reputation in the era of message boards I mean apparently they still do but they used to too
You want the TikTok version It's fine to admit it
Paul s hardware for a more casual source etc etc Pouring one out for Bitwit Kyle
but saying LTT information has a good chance of being wrong is just not true They ve put out bad info in the past You literally contradicted yourself in the very next sentence Correcting your errors after the fact doesn't change the fact they have repeatedly gotten benchmark numbers wrong and given out bad information I don't want to watch a video 3 times to get all the corrections
Right but what is wrong with skipping expo and just manually setting Expo never worked for me but happily ran Asus presets and later Buildzoid to get even better sub timings vs expo and used a safe vsoc too since auto is 1 24 Is thus just expo voids warantee Cuz i ran jdec if I ever call in for warantee
Nope Tuf gaming x670e plus Wi Fi
Don't buy Anustek boards is the advice I'm getting
Update to the latest non beta BIOS
Why don't you want to update your bios is it because of the beta disclaimer
Some of the bios revisions broke mcr Since you don't have x3d no need to use newer broken bios Soc was 1 25 for buildzoid so nothing bad there I dropped to 1 15v now Note if you have entered manual you aren't using expo Expo is just one click for a small subset if memory timings
Funnily enough I m an employment lawyer in Canada so I m very aware of NDAs Sorry to hear they were such a scummy company when I started building computers in the late 2000s their motherboards were awesome Had ordered one making the switch to AM5 but decided to go with MSI instead since I m within the return window if for no other reason than to not support the company s conduct
X79 was one of the last few asus boards made by Pegatron asrock They've since moved to ECS for production
Well count me in buddy ASUS never again
At least Bud Light can't potentially fry your 700 motherboard and 450 CPU
Being a GN fanboy is sad being a fanboy of big mega corporations like AMD or ASUS is just rethink your whole life level of pathetic
I showed you how they try the same BS all the time and hope nobody notice The cpus dying is the result of motherboards running out of spec by default Don't get the cause and result reversed overvolting Intel CPUs is definitely not beneficial for the cpu Just because the CPU doesn't out right die doesn't mean the board vendors should do this Also AGESA is just equivilent to Intel's micro code at most specify the VID that is the voltage requested to the motherboard It is a whole different can of worms if the board obeys The AGESA itself is extremely small in size the vast majority of the Bios UEFI interface is customized by ASUS Notice how Asus constantly overvoltes the CPU despite what is shown in the bios settings even on the later bios and AGESA BTW Asrock never pull their bios from AM5 webpages because they didn't play the overvolt to win reviews game on AM5 On my friend's Asrock X670E PG it alayws applied 1 24 1 25V SOC since the day he got it width 2718 format png auto webp v enabled s 81192df3c9e45630650b0cc7e379d03ace52eb8b
Lol That was Nvidia fix the og design From design body standards org White paper
My bad we had a miscommunication I thought you were saying dont use expo for timings and frequency and vdimm just set it manually If you do this your soc voltage will automatically be raised But if you also set the soc voltage manually then yes it will stay at that value Expo doesn't define soc voltage if you are attempting to manually set ram timings like expo does then you'd leave soc on auto And btw from my testing expo isn't what raises the soc voltage Expo just sets a ram frequency among other things and the bios uses that to decide to raise the soc voltage
There s just not a sure fire option unfortunately Most have terrible RMA support except EVGA US I went with a Gigabyte for my 13900k and at a 500 matching price point to my old ASUS x570 Dark Hero the build quality and features were hands down much better I ve not dealt with Gigabyte RMA in years but I had a pretty shitty time with them too in the 2000s Just buy whatever and hope it lasts I guess What a shame to have to say that
You have to either research first for individual products not just a single brand or take advantage of return periods if you re unhappy with the product in the first 30 days If you happen to live near a Micro Center buy their in house replacement warranty and bypass RMA altogether for up to 3 years from purchase date which is generally length of motherboard or VGA warranties anyway these days EVGA is probably the only exception Their RMA department is ducking incredible Their other products outside of VGA may seem overpriced compared to others but man they don t fuck around with warranty If the product is bad they stand behind it and take care of the issue SWIFTLY
Asus used to be king Now the emperor has no clothes My MSI boards have always treated me well though
Idk about hive but i always use gigabyte for builds Never failed me in years
My cheap asus motherboard from 2019 still going strong
My anecdotal experience recommends MSI and Gigabyte as I've been screwed by ASUS and ASRock before But generally research products not brands
curious to know which company the hive recommends I agree with everything you said except this It's not a hive mind just because you disagree with it
Just buy the cheapest board that has all the features you want and call it a day It really doesnt make too much of a difference imo
That's the wrong way of thinking There's no one good company that's you can always recommend they all have done good and bad products Figure what you want to build and within what fits your needs compatibility budget features etc do a market research check independent reviews and go with what's best that fits your situation
It generally depends on the current news Gigabyte always gets a lot of hate and so does ASUS now I think I'm going to try ASRock for my next build haven't heard a bad thing about them yet Also pretty quick when it comes to releasing new BIOS updates
Same I honestly have never had a single issue with any of their motherboards over the last 15 to 20 years Their routers either
I'm of the unpopular opinion that there really is no one manufacturer that is demonstrably better than all others in terms of reliability All use practically the same design methodologies chip sources manufacturing techniques and quality control systems because they have to People forget just how mind blowingly complex modern PCs really are Billions of transistors spread across dozens of integrated circuits Hundreds of diodes and capacitors and VRMs and other components Hundreds or thousands of feet of electrical traces It's a small miracle it all works I did some Googling and found an news story where the largest PC component vendor in Switzerland has started publishing the return defect rates of the manufacturers they carry Of the major motherboard brands Asus MSI Gigabyte and AsRock most had defect rates in the first two years of less than 4 percent and all of those were within 0 4 of each other Overall return rates whatever the reason were less than 6 percent Where the manufacturers actually differ is in their pricing feature sets and after sale product support I really can't attest to any of the brands' success or failure since I'm one of the lucky ones who just hasn't had any outright failures regardless of the brand
Why does this seem to have become so prevailing in so many faucets of life now a days
Oh very cool where did you find this at
But this X570 MAG board has the best power delivery for under 500 on the market That doesn't even make sense when a board half the price can do the same There is 0 point in 27 phases of 60a capacity when the largest cpu doesn't even come close to using half of it
MSI has been just as bad I'm glad you mentioned this because ultimately any company can be a scumbag in the eyes of consumers I've had DOA motherboards from both MSI and Gigabyte Not only that but I dropped close to 2 grand on an MSI laptop and a little after a year out of warranty 'natch the screen started separating from the lid At about two years the first hinge broke After 2 1 2 years and just before I sold it for parts the second hinge broke Not what I expected from 2 grand and a bunch of MSI fanboys would likely tell me that my experience was a one off I have no brand loyalty because of my experiences Well except for the small batch coffee roaster that is local to me
ASUS Heavy Meme Ask and ye shall receive
If the download comes directly from MSI s website you can no longer guarantee that it isn t malicious
Are there other reports of this happening to the 13700KF or that series
The guy above you is right look at what the other guy said he said he changed the cpu last and everything s fine therefore intel component failure then says he ll never buy an asus mobo That incongruence should be called out regardless of asus scummery attack them for the right reasons scummy warranty avoidance failure to own mistakes
Yes and ZERO reports of that happening on anything but these AM5 boards Stop spreading FUD when you changed far too many variables The only way you could prove this but you won't do it is put your new CPU in your old board to see if it fucks it up But you won't do that
pure FUD conjecture This has to be bullshit and fake
I agree with you 100 but also want to note that the GN merch is actually pretty high quality as well Sure that guy you were replying to might be happy with their 10 pad but I would bet the GN one is nicer in literally every way
And then you get the rare occasion where a company goes into a permanent death spiral of cost cutting such as PCChips back in the 1990s who sold motherboards with fake components empty plastic shells while the soldered BIOS chip would report capabilities that the board simply did not have or would slap Intel VIA UMC etc labels on no brand chipset chips yes there were chipset chips worse than VIA
Packard Bell cough Gateway
That's exactly how it goes AsRock is my current go to mainboard brand 25 years ago they were universally loathed now they make tremendous volume in business computers and good products Of course that may change again any year then I'll find something else I guess
Abit comes to mind They were on top for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s I basically bought nothing but Abit boards and then switched to
I despise the system that prioritizes the shareholders over the consumers Do not hate the player hate the game and the rules that incentivize the player to be selfish and shortsighted
They also released it so damn late over 2 years later than release so it didn t sell well EVGA never have anything ready for launch so early adopters just straight ignore them
If only their boards weren't so expensive though I get that they are directed towards the extreme users but they do command a pretty penny
They blacklisted Hardware Unboxed because of a bad review I like them as well They generally let you fuck around with settings that CPU manufacturers don't like changed I've built a bunch of AM4 PCs with Asrock and Gigabyte and Asrock has been way more stable than GB
Wifi Ethernet adapter on my X570 Taichi basically failed after less than a year experienced multiple disconnections in games till I got a new usb ethernet adapter Wanted to try another manufacturer but the good deals were B650E Asus board unfortunately now
Pegatron owning them is basically Asus running them NFT push Blacklisted Gamers Nexus too because they might be critical of them
ASRock is basically something that was born out of Asus That has much of the same mentality we have seen with Asus in a few matters As in how they handle it
My asrock mobo failed after few years also old radeon gpu from as rock was ultra plagued by issues I dont trust them
Manufactured Supported or designed by Like Foxconn make a lot of shit and a lot of good shit EVGA generally have had good support good 'd trust EVGA a lot more than a lot of other brands in a crisis like the one Asus is going through right now
Or Seasonic Super Flower Enermax plus CWT and some more as OEM Actually how many people do know that most PSUs are OEM'ed And often for some shady manufacturerers Corsair wink wink
I find their ram to be decent as well think g skills might be better least in the top end but never had an issue with corsair ram in the last 2 decades
I am 0 3 on their PSUs One of them even had something explode and I wasn't even gaming at the time so it's not like my system was under much load
And MSI
You can get Biostar Mobos on AliExpress I believe they ship worldwide
Ik EVGA isn't perfect and thier mobos can be expensive but they are an option
so far asrock has been solid for me on the taichi and my friend has a matx asrock and hes had no issue
With all these gaming brands their ProCreate Aero D whatever product lines are just a variant of their usual gaming themed boards Sure they might have a Thunderbolt port or two but other than that they get the same BIOS and the same lackluster validation and support
Good to hear I just bought a b650 oaths elite ax and a 7800x3d I ve been feeling apprehensive after all the negative coverage of the B650
I built two friends setups with the B650E Riptide and 7800X3Ds for being on the lower end of AM5 board cost they were pretty nice Checked up on them after all the X3D issues popped up and they were running 1 25 VSOC on the bios they shipped with with EXPO enabled Can't say the same for my more expensive Asus mobo 7800X3D lol Went with them since my Maximus VI Formula has been going strong for 11 years now but this will be my last one from them
I have the b650e riptide with zero complaints
Actually i switched from Asus to Gigabyte and the BIOS aren't all that different unless you're speaking about colour choices They're VERY similar
I think that was also because some Chinese company stole a cap recipe from a Japanese manufacturer and screwed it up I remembered replacing so many components under warranty with blown caps around the early to mid 2000s
My Core i7 920 rig built in 2009 had a DFI LANParty mobo Came with a strap contraption that wrapped around your case to you could carry it hiyo Only used it twice when moving from my apartment to my friend's when I stayed there while househunting and again when I moved into my home
My mobo during battlefield 2 days Ahh memories
I have owned DFI Abit Asrock ECS Gigabyte and Asus Gigabyte were by far the most feature rich reliable and overall overclocked best for me I also buy and sell gpus to basically pay for my PC parts GB cards have been very reliable while I had issues with other brands I'm going GB myself next Disclaimer thats my own opinion and you can flame be about GB p
To be fair it is a beta and not the final release I don't understand why folks aren't just setting to defaults and waiting for a final bios No expo no OC at all Keep SoC at 1 3v I don't use AMD but that is what I would do until they release a final version
I know AMD Intel motherboard makers shouldn't show their products in benchmarks etc using XMP EXPO PBO MCE etc and go look how awesome these features are
AMD invented EXPO to go with their CPUs If RMA requests start getting denied due to EXPO you can bet lawsuits will follow
Lumping overclocking in with XMP or EXPO is being very disingenuous You are ignoring so much important context AMD themselves have said they will 100 RMA any chip that is affected by this problem and this problem is clearly tied to EXPO Memory support on mobo are validated using EXPO and XMP and are shown on the products website To conflate overclocking with EXPO is silly You going in and changing the voltage and clock speeds on your CPU yourself is not the same as turning on a profile that was thoroughly tested by the board manufacturer Thats like saying a chip that dies when PBO was enabled wouldn't be covered because its 'overclocking'
i am pretty sure just setting everything to Auto doesn't even strictly conform to official specifications
This is 100 truth and shouldn't be downvoted
Which after this became a problem the AMD recommendation is vsoc not going past 1 3 Not true AMD put a hard cap on it not a recommendation We don't know what the recommendation was beforehand
Yep I also have a text file on my phone with all the fan temp pwm values too haha DDR5 is a good choice prices have been steadily coming down in the past few months Unfortunately I never noticed or saw an export fan setting button on the gigabyte board But it may be hidden as their UI is really bad The biggest problem I think they have is they Most vendors tend to have both a table input alongside with a graph I know ASUS and MSI definitely does On gigabyte I would click on the graph's dot then input values using the keyboard While on MSI I could have use the keyboard entirely input the value then arrow key or tab to enter in the next one differences of a few clicks but it adds up The only time I change my fan curves or have to clear CMOS is when i'm setting up the memory overclocks So the fact that bios profiles saved on the same bios version doesn't load in the previously inputted fan settings was unexpected But then again I may have missed that export fan setting file button nevertheless that would be an additional step On MSI it definitely loads all your fan curve settings if you load in a profile saved on the same bios ver Even accidently entering flashing mode and leaving it clears the BIOS and causes the other issue Interesting that's good to know I have yet to encountered it Personally I only used the flashback feature twice ever once on a B450M Mortar and once on this board Pro B650 P to revert all the new bios changes lol I think they improved the feature slightly in a small incremental way It's a much brighter white LED light now instead of a dim red light you'll instantly know if you turned it on So long as it's connected to the mains and you clicked on the button it'll stay lit up like a bulb now It's unfortunate but sadly updating bios regardless of which motherboard vendor you go will wipe all previous settings It does gets pretty old having to change everything ngl Also quick question Dose this issue ONLY apply to the 7800X3D thought I heard that somewhere IDK Because if I so if I do go AMD I'm getting the R7 7700X Yup it likely only applies to the X3D chips as they are more locked down some features available on the normal chips weren't made available until just recently eg curve optimiser and PBO power limits You would get a more complete bios with less restrictions on the 7700x
I didn't say it was good I just said it was much better than the 1 year that people often state Ideally I'd want at least 4 years of security patches without any Android version changes but not many phones offer that
I dont think it will hurt sales much I mean how many cpus actually died I wouldnt be surprised for everyone that died there is 500 to 1000 people happy with their Asus MB Ryzen 7000 cpu
Yep that was it I will browse the subreddit then Thanks
No Hard no Your pushing the liability on the consumer Which is EXACTLY what Asus wants Fuck that This is a corporate issue not a consumer issue
If that fixes the said issue at hand what's the point of selling it then
I think there was one done by someone testing but it was extreme from what I remember and I don t believe any actual user reports of anything with non 3D have came out
I ve been subscribed to Jayztwocents since he had 40k subs way back when he still worked a regular job other then YouTube and he is still the same guy he was back then Gamers Nexus on the other hand I ve only been subscribed for about the last 2 years Both great channels and trustworthy sources of information
No I'm saying I dont have time to watch a fuckin 30 minute video when 15 20 minute video would give me exactly the same information
I did not contradict myself I would have been contradicting myself if I stated that they ve never once made a mistake A standard that no publication can say they ve reached tech YouTubers or beyond
Manual is ok as long as all your timings and subtimings are set to match expo as well If you just manually set your ram to 6000 and left everything else to auto then yes you re leaving A LOT of performance on the table
Hm I keep seeing x670 and b650 bios differences must be b650 x670 and then b650e x670e bios
Yeah
The overvoltage issue applies to all 7000 series processors not just the x3d chips My 7900x on a gigabyte b650 was running at 1 42v auto and the latest update at this time F5c which also claims to fix the overvoltage issue Follow AMD guidance to limit max SOC voltage to 1 3V for Ryzen 7000 series X3D and non X3D CPUs 't after I updated I got to see my CPU up at 1 42v again so I had to go back in and manually set it again
It just destroys your liver and your manhood
wow putting words i never said into my
Ah no I did mean I've manually set the voltages for everything whilst also using expo profile Think by default it wanted like 1 35v which not as bad as some personally was too high and total stable at 1 15v or least no issues on 2 plus weeks of usage But no don't personally touch the expo timings not gone thar deep into it yet I do understand a 30cl kit so it's fairly on the low end to start with Edit think I jinxed it just randomly restarted XD odd it survived a stress test and has been doing the idle test Will up it to 1 17v and see if that's nicer Happened right after I replied as well quite spooky I suspect maybe voltages a bit too low Though been fine all day so who knows
I've had to rma a mobo once it was Asus and they ended up keeping my board for a week and shipping the exact same one back with no work performed They ended up shipping one on advance after that but like wtf guys
Currently have an x570 asus board No issues so far well looking back now I had issues with memory OC and only really xmp worked any fine tuning no boot and completely gimped the board so that I had to reflash the bios several times for which the according usb port and button where basically a requirement or else I would have had to do an RMA that wasn't great but the cause was probably mediocre RAM else no issues but same for my previous parts even my used purchased 290x gpu is still running and it's also asus Probably been lucky only ever thing I had to RMA was a psu like 3 months before end of the 5 year warranty that was like 10 years ago and it's still running so no complaints there either
Updoot for EVGA RMA support Solid as a fucking rock Sad that I wasn't able to snag any of their GPUs before they shut the division down On par with Sapphire in terms of quality support
The gigabyte had better build quality
EVGA is probably the only exception Their RMA department is ducking incredible Their other products outside of VGA may seem overpriced compared to others but man they don t fuck around with warranty If the product is bad they stand behind it and take care of the issue SWIFTLY When I picked out the parts for my PC I considered using EVGA parts Unfortunately there wasn't a single part that worked for my build They don't make GPUs anymore They don't make AMD motherboards and none of their PSUs are ATX 3 compliant
I found it back when this whole thing started coming out through some quick google research Not sure exactly of the website
I honestly don't know why they did it it's just lots of cost to them But I don't mind rewarding them producing a high quality product Nothing bad about good quality
I was more referring to this v O6BXwCJtaZE v O6BXwCJtaZE
You clearly don't understand what happened They stole keys to make your computer think it's signed by MSI They didn't fuck with the website downloads
Yeah no This is a signature cert MSI servers and web certs weren't compromised that we know of If it's published on MSI's site it's fine What's changed is this previously you could post something malicious on the web pretending to be from MSI but you weren't able to sign it and the OS would have safeguards warning you against installation Now that the keys are leaked it can be also signed so your OS will recognize it as legitimate If you continue to only download the package from MSI directly and you don't bypass security warnings when installing you're fine Always be vigilant where web links are leading to
Yuup This is a majorly big deal and very much not FUD
As of this moment I don t know I just know I was troubleshooting my computer for 7 days and replacing all the hardware I could think of except for my CPU because it was passing all the benchmarks When I finally reached my wits end and was fully defeated I took the chance and replaced my CPU Everything worked fine after replacing it And I ran across the videos about the Asus boards from gamers nexus and it all made sense
Right because replacing every piece of hardware to include the board wasn t conclusive When I put the 13700KF into the new MSI motherboard it was still crashing AFTER replacing the RAM and GPU Than when I replace the CPU it all works Can your brain not use deductive thinking
I do kinda miss the cow print boxes lol
No players no game So yeah hate the players
They blacklisted Hardware Unboxed because of a bad review which is shitty and shady but HUBs mobo reviews are basically power delivery reviews i don't see that as terribly useful and asrock often skimps on power to delivery to deliver value elsewhere it's hard to fault them for wanting to avoid that reviewer i like HUB
Is there any evidence of this I hear it all the time and as far as I can tell it is just because the name is similar
If the product is crap The warranty better be good
I was thinking about their current line of PSUs They haven't contracted Seasonic CWT or Superflower in forever
Still just pasting their name on hardware they didn't produce
Their ddr4 on average performd bad I would guess ddr5 is better though
Garbage warrenty support issues with x570 vrm's and msi's software in general
So yeah basically not available anywhere as you would have to be insane to buy anything on ali express
lol scarily accurate
Hey OP Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3 Be civil and follow side wide rules this means no insults personal attacks slurs brigading mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on r AMD Please read the rules or message the mods for any further clarification
Expensive is an understatement
They're definitely not perfect for AMD CPUs
Same here It's just that they aren't very high end stuff but I can live with it
Agreed was mostly just trying to highlight that more than one vendor is doing these type of boards And they are absolutely just re skinned versions of their enthusiast boards
I think that was the full reason for the quality but it still all came down to penny pinching on a critical component
what do you meqn buy and sell gpus
Actually Gigabyte is the brand I've been leaning towards for a while They seem to have quite a few features that seem actually useful Like being able to update BIOS with no CPU or GPU being able to backup BIOS settings and restore them after a BIOS update also being able to save your fan profiles to a file Also cool that you can make a memory overclocking profile with all of the settings timings voltage etc and they can be shared online Probably will never use that honestly but it's a cool idea
Because they paid 1k for the mobo and cpu not enabling expo gimps the AMD chips specifically the x3ds by like 15 20 A manufacturer fucking up and releasing hardware that pushes 1 4v stock and then playing legal footsie with a bios update is reprehensible Didn't issue a recall didn't own their mistake just said whoopsie our 700 board just cooked your 300 cpu better tweak this because our bios doesn't report the correct SOC voltage
Especially since those specific features are automated
Maybe but it s largely a grey area They usually highlight overclocking oriented boards so it s not unreasonable for them to advertise these boards while overclocked Is it questionable to advertise a feature that voids the warranty perhaps but why buy an overclocking board unless you plan on overclocking and this has literally been the case for like 10 15 years now and it rarely causes any issues unless you admit to overclocking or modifying the board in some way I see many comments saying this needs to change and warranty should cover overclocking but there is pretty much zero chance they d ever officially extend warranties to cover any type of overclocking Much higher likelihood they d pull out any form of overclocking severely limit it or sell some type of tuning warranty like Intel used to do
AMD invented EXPO to go with their CPUs If RMA requests start getting denied due to EXPO you can bet lawsuits will follow If AMD doesn't lock overclocking then they're liable for when users use the overclocking functionality to run parts out of spec and kill the chip AMD specifically disclaims that functionality in their GD 106 GD 112 statements even if the overclocking is enabled using AMD utilities tools they're not going to cover overclocking Whether that holds up in the EU it's not an inherently unfair position either and it's not new that's been the rule for both brands for decades now Like again I don't disagree with you that the line is blurry with Expo and especially with them advertising with marketing that uses Expo Expo has been wink nudge kinda not overclocking even if it's against the letter of the policy directly so in fact but it's never enforced if you don't rub it in their faces I remember pointing this out 5 years ago when memory tuning first got big on AMD like guys you are really zapping that VSOC and even if you are just enabling XMP that can kick up voltages And at the time nobody knew AMD disclaimed it many people specifically claimed it was allowed and reacted poorly when I cited the Gaming Directive there And Intel did have the Tuning Plan warranty that allowed you to insure the chips if they failed due to 's position was actually a bit more generous than AMD's Which people did not like to hear But at the same time the easy answer here is ok if we're liable if users turn this dial then you won't be allowed to turn that dial And that certainly will hold up in the EU Not allowing overclocking isn't illegal and will solve the warranty problems Long term overclocking is going to be less and less of a thing anyway 5nm is very delicate compared to even 7nm and 7nm is very delicate compared to previous generations And stacking it makes everything even more complex let alone stacking different processes from different foundries In 5 years everything is going to be as delicate as X3D chips currently are with leading products being even moreso There just is not going to be the wiggle room to do anything useful in the future there isn't anything to gain and it's going to be easier and easier to kill chips and I really think the odds of allowing it at all are incredibly numbered In 10 years nobody will allow manual voltage control other than negative offsets for undervolting Stock settings will functionally be the max voltage allowed and you can go down but not up and even then I think there will be very little room to go down before something becomes unstable with 2 5D 3D silicon And this might be the straw that broke the camel's back right here honestly Is zen5 really going to allow overclocking I wonder
Unlikely XMP is licensed by Intel Have they been sued for it
AMD themselves have said they will 100 RMA any chip that is affected by this problem and this problem is clearly tied to EXPO Only because of the higher SoC voltages the boards apply when you run EXPO XMP DOCP Memory support on mobo are validated using EXPO and XMP and are shown on the products website Which is not a guarantee of anything every board vendor will say memory overclocking is not covered by warranty and depends on quality of your CPU IMC RAM and motherboard To conflate overclocking with EXPO is silly It is overclocking it changes the frequency the IMC operates at Thats like saying a chip that dies when PBO was enabled wouldn't be covered because its 'overclocking' It wouldn't be at least if you admit to it There is literally a pop up when you enable PBO that says it's not covered by warranty
Why Auto leaving everything at default won't engage XMP EXPO DOCP and it will leave all voltages and frequencies at stock
Luckily reddit downvotes don't change reality
It's not a hard cap The motherboard manufacturers can still enable it to go over that This video points out that even Asus' beta bios doesn't properly cap it and it goes past 1 3v when tested
Again not an expert here unless you have a big place and want to use 5ghz band for homenetworkin tv cameras NAS etc what do you need mesh for 5ghz does not have good range in any router but 2ghz is enough for most users On the problems I agree most are common across brands Asus has better features through software but they don't QC them well Additionally they also softwarelocks some hardware components even though they pack it and unlocks them for higher models If you're a bit techsavvy you can get a raspberrypi and install a router OS like OpenWRT add hardware modules you need and enjoy all the features
Four years is still really bad though If the battery hadn't turned to mush I'd still be using my iPhone 6S today And looking it up that's only just this month no longer receiving version updates Seven and a half years old And the wording implies they'll be continuing security updates for a while longer As it is the main reason I switched to a new phone rather than just replace the battery in my old was because the 12 Mini was such a lovely form factor I guess I never considered how good Apple are about product longevity It's the same with my iPod Shuffle Thirteen years old now and I'm still using it
How many Gigabyte PSUs actually blew up yet people steer clear of Gigabyte as a result of that mess How many people are leery of NZXT due to riser cards burning Sometimes it's not a immediate mass exodus in the wake of a snafu like this but people just looking elsewhere when making future purchases Then one day ASUS wakes up and wonders why they're not selling much because by its very nature their customer base are more technically inclined and knowledgeable than the average hamster Also imagine your blow off of the actual problem but substituting cars instead of mobos Is 1 in 500 or 1 in 1000 people whose cars explode and kill their families no big deal Not if you're the one It's like the line in the new Oppenheimer trailer where Matt Damon asks Are we saying that there's a chance that when we push that button we destroy the world Oppenheimer replies Chances are near zero Damon Near zero Oppenheimer What do you want from theory alone Damon Zero would be nice I haven't had any problems in three months with my rig but that doesn't mean I'm in the clear perhaps it takes time to kill my CPU but I shouldn't have to worry about it and ASUS is doing everything wrong in their management of this crisis
Not sure if you're being deliberately obtuse or are genuinely missing all the points due to reading comprehension issues OK Bub what is the correct solution for immediate mitigation of the problem Do nothing to protect yourself or tear apart your rig and demand a refund and go buy another mobo Who gives the refund You're stomping around demanding ASUS suffer for their sins and no one is opposed to that other than this one simp here who feels that ASUS like Thanos has done nothing wrong but when there is no proper BIOS yet available what are users with ASUS boards supposed to do Shut off their rigs until ASUS gets their shit together It takes zero effort to whine and point at problems but what is the solution that you demand be implemented All you're doing is swinging at me for daring suggest a stop gap band aid
Some people do not trust a product that requires such a fix or trust the fix itself is sufficient It's up to the individual and their comfort after Asus broke their trust
i think 3 or 4 years now on jay 5 on ltt 2 on level1tech 2 years and then drop off of gn after noticing not using current pc hardware for test bed pc his fan base getting really religious in general same game bench marks over and over edit not used half of it should have instead of higher new people that are skill in certain area that he would not be in
The have each section marked out Skip to what you want to hear about and avoid the rest
You can claim whatever you want it doesn't change reality When GN puts out benchmarks they're correct When Linus puts out benchmarks they might be right or wrong stay tuned to find out That's the point
1413 is the latest non beta one for me 1414 and 1601 are still beta I have set my soc voltage to 1 25 and the highest I have seen it since was 1 26
Search to see if there are problems with the next to last one then if you are worried about bugs or whatever You will be okay The odds of damage isn't likely its a very small number of users having these issues Plus anytime you buy the latest stuff you take a chance on stuff
Don't run auto Set to 1 2 and no over voltage
Liver yes Manhood What are you an Indonesian imam Fuck outta here with the beta talk Drink what you want Eat what you want
I'm the one trolling Lol
Yep Still probably more expensive than a mother board should be but they re all expensive these days Extremely happy with it
Yes at least it does to me I got the z790 Aorus Master The easy GPU release button is amazing The NVME latches are fantastic Way better than dealing with the shitty tiny screws The board also has a metallic finish and isn t oozing with ROG ROG ROG all over it in corny tech graffiti The software isn t much to be desired but no one s is unfortunately
So asus has about 40 of the AM4 market which does make sense that we would see more of this issue come up with asus boards than others Not sure we can make the conclusion that asus is more vulnerable to this than others but who knows
But now they can fuck with the site downloads and appear legit
Do we know that the complete leak is public If they aquired that cert what makes you think they didn't also get the private key to their website cert or credentials to the webserver hosting service Or that they didn't leave behind a backdoor for future attacks In my opinion nothing from MSI can be trusted anymore Since they weren't able to protect one of the most significant secrets to their products what makes you believe that the rest of their security isn't similarly flawed as well
All the attention has been focused on the AMD 7xxxX3D chips There'll need to be a lot more investigation into the Intel chips if your suspicion is to be confirmed
Without having done anything to actually confirm that the motherboard affected the CPU you re just making wild connections here Parts can fail independently after working fine Saying that isn t a defense of ASUS it s just basic problem solving
Idk I could say the same about you Why wouldn t you just RMA the CPU instead of replacing the whole motherboard These components sometimes do die and guess what they die in the first few weeks That s why they give 1 year warranties because that s the most common time when defects happen But it s okay you can think what you want to think And I ll think what I want to think
I think that's the most useful thing to review Bad VRMs can hurt performance a lot Once you make a list of all the specs you want in a motherboard and you're down to 3 4 choices there's no other way to differentiate them
They used to be a subsidiary owned by ASUS but were spun off in the early 2000s Then later on they went fully independent Now they're under pegaton
The easy explanation It says so on the ASRock wiki page The more complicated one Well if you go on their homepage for their corporate overview You will notice that most of their current directors and chairman all have experience from Asustek Asustek was the old name before they split their operation into 3 companies in 2008 Asus Pegatron and Unihan ASRock as mentioned came under Pegatron during all of this The chairman for ASRock listed on my first link Is also the Senior Vice President of Pegatron xj4y7vzkg
EVGA's mobos at least the really super expensive ones show they know how to make a quality product I think it's just a case of mass market and obviously quality manufacturing standards Their design team though is good and it has been for years
Luckily Super Flower has been available in the US for quite a few years now though only through Newegg My last two have been from their Leadex line and they have been great
Isn't the evga G6 a seasonic psu rebranded focus gx
I mean apple do
And Every company does this AMD doesn t produce their own silicon Does that AMD is just slapping a label on TSMC cups Should Nvidia start putting cooler master on all of their coolers Should case makers start labeling each screw because they didn t produce them Should intel start putting Made by god because they didn t produce the sand that their cpus are made out of Oems are a thing it s not like Corsair is straight up ripping off products They are working with the manufacturer to make something
Good to know I was under the impression that MSI and Asrock AM4 AM5 boards were the best So who is left to buy
Well color me insane I bought a lot of stuff from Aliexpress Never had an issue Also here is a quote talking about their world wide presence Biostar has 5 major offices across the globe Alongside its HQ in Sindian City Taiwan the USA is run out of California West Coast and Miami East Coast with another office for Latin America APAC Asia Pacific is run from China and Europe from the Netherlands Taken from
Hey OP Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3 Be civil and follow side wide rules this means no insults personal attacks slurs brigading mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on r AMD Please read the rules or message the mods for any further clarification
They compare favorably in their class versus offerings from the big four IMO
The Taichi has quite a few bells and whistles imo For me one of the best offerings from an I O panel standpoint as well
i mean the X670E Taichi was the only board that i saw that supported 8 sata ports as well as 4NVME drives the only downside is you cant use PCIE bifurcation on it for more nvme drives but in all it is a solid board I do wish it had 1 or 2 pcie x1 or x4 slots for things like a capture card but overall I am happy with my purchase and the soc voltages on mine were never higher then 1 25V with expo enabled
Buy cheap mining gpus clean them up and resell them on my local hardware forms If you keep 100 positive feedback people trust so it works I do list them as ex miners Finding deals in bulk is basically key to this
Enabling XMP is not 't speak to expo but I don't think it is either You have to force the bios to run in either
It's not a grey area though Either the CPU RAM both perform worse than advertised which is false advertising or you turn on stuff to reach advertised performance but doing so voids the warranty of CPU RAM motherboard Reaching advertised performance should not require the user to void warranty on CPU RAM motherboard or any combination thereof
they don't just publish benchmarks with EXPO settings the motherboards publish QVL's which list official support for the memory kits
but why buy an overclocking board unless you plan on overclocking I'll point out that it's almost impossible to buy a board that doesn't support some form of overclocking if you're looking for certain features that are unrelated to overclocking That's not AMDs or Intel's fault that's on their board partners of course but show me a board with Thunderbolt USB 4 for a current generation that doesn't support at least XMP EXPO Even the boards that aren't marketed toward overclocking specifically like ASUS' ProArt or Gigabyte's Aero support overclocking similarly to other boards in their price class
There's also pretty much zero chance they would win against a class action in court with the argument this feature that we used in literally every single benchmark and marketing material we The ignorance of the gen pop would shaft the companies because no judge or jury would understand that bassackwards logic rolling on the floor laughing Judge So you only marketed your parts performance with this feature enabled ASUS AMD INTEL Well yes Judge cool case already on the phone Hey bill yeah I'm out early headed to the lake for some bass fishing get out there What Yeah these corporate lawyers are idiots idk man ASUS AMD INTEL confused slightly insulted faces
The line is blurry because of the marketing how they are doing it and categorizing their products and how they talk about EXPO Not because of the practice of overclock voids warranty You re purposefully wandering
But at the same time the easy answer here is ok if we're liable if users turn this dial then you won't be allowed to turn that dial And that certainly will hold up in the EU Not allowing overclocking isn't illegal and will solve the warranty problems Exactly PC enthusiasts should be very careful what they wish advocate for The end resolution here won't be warranty extended to cover overclocking XMP EXPO and DOCP the end resolution will be the complete removal of overclocking or even more limits placed on overclocking There's also a strong argument to get rid of overclocking due to how much RMA abuse occurs when people get a CPU or GPU that doesn't overclock as well as they'd hoped
Have they denied RMAs I have never seen Intel deny an RMA
There is literally a pop up when you enable PBO that says it's not covered by warranty I'm pretty certain PBO is enabled by default on ASUS rog 'd need a trash cpu to go into the bios with to disable it or you've already run the intended cpu at pbo on first bootup
The setting is still capped at 1 3 the real voltage supplied can go over that
You're merging usability with updates You can still use a device that hasn't received updates in a while like your iPod Shuffle And yes Apple is good at updating the few products that they have just like they're good at locking people in or out of their ecosystem
Oh wow where how are you comparing failing cpus to death of people Lol We have a drama queen here
Wow lol
Asus broke their trust It's a corporation after all with the general objective of making profit I doubt they could care about one's personal feeling about the brand
Level1Tech is great as well I enjoy his Level1Linux channel too Wendell I learn from the most He is very smart and been watching him since he was part of Tek Syndicate back in the day where he would not show his face in all the videos
You re missing the point each segment has a tendency to recap the previous I don t know if it s specifically to combat people skipping but I find it really frustrating
Third link for Gamers Nexus Correction search is GN tweeting out that they fucked up their 13900K graphs good chance they re wrong smh
LTT is basically tech bros casual lite 90 of their content is not hardware focused anymore They just want to appeal to the biggest audience possible
It doesn't make me that nervous I just hate troubleshooting And i really don't want to disassemble my pc
Yes that's what I said I did
Are you typing this while wearing panties
Dylan is that you
rethink your whole life level of pathetic
Watch the video linked above it explains what Asus did that exacerbated the issue
That s not how that works man Somebody could use this to make it so that the drivers you downloaded from for some stupid reason look like they re from MSI Obviously overstated here and I believe anyone who would download from a site like that wouldn t care if they were properly signed anyway But if it looks close enough that ll be how they get you Most certainly not hurr durr even the ones from the official site are bad
I'm just responding to what was reported not theoretical scenarios Nobody has reported that happened so I have no reasonable reason to believe it's happened Its possible in theory for sure
Steve really is our saviour on this matter a few years ago he did call out the board vendors for their BS on Intel side Don't Run Z490 Motherboards with Default Settings Thermals Power Boosting MCE for 10th Gen CPUs GamersNexus Gaming PC Builds Hardware Benchmarks
Yes that I understand I was just putting my personal experience out there with MY Asus board I m not saying that my Asus board was definitely the cause of my faulty CPU but after three weeks of working fine and then all of a sudden my CPU becoming faulty my Asus board was a very likely suspect Especially after coming across these videos I know the videos are tailored to AMD but who is to say that these boards weren t doing the same thing with intel chipsets There s already another user who is having the same issues as me with a 13900K and an Asus motherboard
How am I making wild connections I replaced every piece of hardware on my Asus MOBO EXCEPT for the CPU and was still getting crashes When I replaced my motherboard with an MSI motherboard and the old CPU I was still getting crashes with all the new hardware that I replaced Finally I replaced the CPU and it all worked Am I saying definitively that my Asus motherboard broke my CPU No I am not However there is also another user with the same crashes as me with an Asus MOBO and a 13900K who already commented here Its a really weird coincidence that Gamers Nexus is proving these Asus motherboards are messing up CPU's yes AMD CPU's not Intel and my CPU became faulty with an Asus board Either way I will never purchase another Asus board as long as I live
Okay kril89 you're right
Thanks
Evga does not make the motherboards It's made for them Also remember EVGA x79 VRMs Those were a housefire and a half
2 years is so long ago
Yes Yes Yes And yes I would love all companies to be transparent with who or what oem they go with on a given product Like car parts Lambo's having Volvo parts in them classic
For Nvidia I thought it was PNY that did some of their professional line
The big issue with Corsair is that they change parts without any notification So you may look at a review of some RAM kit which allegedly uses b die and works well so you buy that same model they changed it and it's no longer b die now they use some cheap RAM chips instead Or you wanted dual rank but you got unlucky and got some single rank
Msi might have gotten their stuff together on the hardware side but their software still isn't great you coul go for a lower end gigabyte or asrock board and pray you never need to call warrenty or wait and hope evga make an am5 board
Yes you have to flip a switch But that's all you have to do No custom settings no tinkering no guesswork All of that was set up for you by the manufacturers That's the entire purpose of XMP EXPO
I can guarantee you every slide or video will have a disclaimer that overclocking voids warranty and performance figures may very depending on other factors like what RAM SSD Storage is used
QVL will include stuff based on XMP EXPO levels My 2700x only officially supports 2933 MHz but the QVL supports 3200 kits And according to JEDEC everything over 2400 MHz is overclocking and to even get those higher RAM speeds even if officially listed by your chip you HAVE to enable XMP EXPO settings in the UEFI And RAM sticks only have JEDEC profiles for the slowest speed
You realise even if you buy a high end board that does have overclocking you aren't forced to enable any of the overclocking features
No Instead they'll just have robust conversations behind closed doors and judges will suddenly do a 180 after those robust conversations
this feature that we used in literally every single benchmark and marketing material we What do you think all the disclaimers at the end of every slide video are for
Exactly PC enthusiasts should be very careful what they wish advocate for Thing is if that is indeed the decision that AMD Intel push for AMD will suffer substantially as EXPO is way more relevant to the general performance for the Ryzen CPU's than XMP is for Intel By disabling that dial they will also be restricting their ability to advertise using those metrics which hits AMD more than Intel
It's also potentially possible to have warranty void e fuses in the chip itself Have two of the pins be isolated when they're stock and if you enable OC mode it blows the e fuse and they're permanently shorted together Even if the CPU completely dies you can check those pins and see whether the warranty was ever voided AMD and Intel really have not taken any of the technical steps that are possible to identify the users that have done this People don't even realize how simple some of this stuff is if AMD Intel want to do it this is trivial stuff that's built into almost every microcontroller for things like read write protection so you can't just dump the binaries via JTAG and similar functionality is already built in for the AMD Platform Lock It can eventually be broken sometimes but it does fantastic at keeping the 99 9999 of honest people honest someone laser decapping the die has obviously voided the warranty But yeah I agree if it becomes a problem then they will just make overclocking go away or physically record when overclocking has taken place The end result here is not going to be full warranty for OC And enthusiasts are so dumb and short sighted about this stuff in general Like the people complaining about rumors of NVIDIA reducing wafer starts during Q4 2021 to spike prices during the holiday as ridiculous as that was since wafers take 6 months anyway actually they probably should have reduced wafer starts given the end of mining and the changeover to Ada The end result isn't 3090s for 100 it's a Turing style holding pattern until the inventory bubble burns through And with the partners complaining about firesale pricing ruining their the end result is clearly going to be that the firesales go away so margins can be maintained NVIDIA ain't cutting theirs nor are they writing partners a refund check to cover overexuberent mining profiteering Or whining about Max Q being a thing and it going away and leaving us with mystery TDP
Intel seems to do it as a CYA statement but they don't seem to care at least in my experience with their RMAs as long as you haven't done anything crazy to the CPU Although I RMA'd a delidded 8700k a long time ago and they still gave me a replacement so something tells me they don't even check the thing when they get it they just chuck it and send you a new one For the segfaulting issue on the first gen ryzen's I sent AMD evidence of it segfaulting while overclocked and forgot that it was overclocked in the screenshots and they RMA'd it without a care So both AMD and Intel saying EXPO XMP is warranty voided seems like CYA statements but I still don't like them since they can randomly enforce it at will while advertising their performance using options that officially void your warranty
Yes numerous posts online about Intel denying warranty if you admit to overclocking or using XMP
I think even Steve mentioned in the video that they tested this a few years back and there was no issue with an RMA when XMP was in play
The iPod was an aside it's no use comparing to an iPhones longevity since as a simple MP3 player it doesn't actually need updates just compatible software on the desktop iTunes does still work just fine with it but it's not really seeing much attention since nobody buys music any more The iPod is limited more by how long its battery can go without swelling which honestly is more or less out of Apple's hands anyway Thirteen years is a long life for a lithium cell whether it's a cheap cell or an expensive one
No you twerp I'm mocking your blithe attitude that people should accept 0 2 failure rates because the other 499 people didn't have a problem If YOU had scrimped and saved for a long time to build a PC and got one of the cursed mobos how would you feel I guess you're too rich to have to worry about such things
I also do Lawrence system and cross talk to That more network side thru
We just noticed the power efficiency chart contains a charting error This error doesn't change any of our conclusions CPU is still 300W after all and the rest of the results are plotted correctly However there is an error so correction Their chart was wrong in the video Their data was correct You need to spend less time on Reddit Jesus Christ
The hell's a Dylan
I use wired ethernet exclusively and haven't had any issues at all I don't really use the wireless No problems with this board yet whatsoever Fingers crossed I like the deep steel blue look of it It's unique compared to all the white and black boards The NVME slots have a retractable latch instead of the tiny awful screws The GPU slot also has a latch that has an easy release button to the right side of the board Fantastic for releasing the GPU without trying to wiggle your fingers or a device underneath the GPU to release like other boards The RGB and general aesthetics are more mature and not overly gamery I don't particularly enjoy when manufacturers put rainbow vomit and cringey gamer terms all over the board Looks at ASUS It has eons of USB 3 0 ports and 3 USB C ports All of the PCI E slots are re inforced
A better way to put the risk would be if they can fuck with the website somehow then you can no longer tell that the drivers are bad Given that they were able to get into MSI s systems and exfiltrate this key and so much other data can we assume the MSI website is safe from tampering
You re very confident about that What you should be is cautious As it s possible MSI themselves are compromised still
If someone were to gain access or abuse their access they can now do malicious things on the official site Downloading from the official site is only safe if it's not compromised and the second layer of security with the certs is lost now
You do have way more trust into a company than you should have There's no post mortem by MSI until then a breach into their network breaks all trust to that company by default At least if you're a little concerned about IT security There's just some obscure statement No significant impact our business in terms of financial and operational currently The Company is also enhancing the information security control measures of its network and infrastructure to ensure data security Yeah that's not enough to regain trust Until there's an official post mortem that company will not get any business from me or any clients I work with
They design them though I thought
They still sell it though dont they current line
That s a completely different issue fuck Corsair
Thanks
Right but my point is that it isn't a default Hopefully most pc builders understand that by flipping this switch your are indeed enabling overclocking You aren't forced to do it
That s fine but then that specifically cannot use that in any public official metrics Advertising it as they do implies official warranty backed support
Absolutely
Like I 's legal climate Would be akin to Chevy telling you you can't put your C8 into sport mode without voiding your warranty Also why both Intel and AMD rarely deny a warranty claim solely for expo xmp use
I believe Intel CPUs already have internal fuses that blow is certain voltages are exceeded I suspect they rarely if ever check this though I also agree that many enthusiasts are short sighted it would be great if overclocking was covered but that's never going to happen and if you start pushing lawsuits the end result will be more restrictions on overclocking or manufacturers will remove it entirely
Companies in todays age dont care about the 0 2 failure rates The cost of reducing that 0 2 greatly exceeds their loss from it so they leave it It's capitalism and is calculated If they got a bad mobo they can return exchange it from where they bought it if they are within the return period or go through the warranty process with the manufacturer Thats what people do Does matter if you are rich or poor We all do this
I ve watched a few videos from Lawrence systems but not too many yet
Those are completely different certs for totally different things One doesn t get driver signature checks through the OS when visiting YouTube nor can driver signing certificiates from any vendor get me access to their YouTube website or any other thing associated with them It s literally just windows driver certificates Which to be clear is bad but it s a key for a totally different lock a key that won t even fit into whatever lock they have have on their website
It's like if GM designed the car but it was built in a Hyundai factory
They rarely deny a claim because few people will outright admit to overclocking If you believe you have a rock solid legal argument start a lawsuit
Exactly this Vendors offering features tailored toward enthusiasts including offering more robust boards came about in the first place because people were already doing a lot of this stuff manually cooking up weird mods etc There's an inherent social contract there we support you doing off the path stuff and providing products tailored for that purpose but it's your responsibility to understand the risks inherent in what you're doing Fair trade I'm not interested in going back to the days of the pencil trick and wire trick
I was going to reply that you seem to have a dim view of capitalism if you think they price in that many faulty units but some cursory Googling revealed that a 0 2 failure rate would be cause for celebration unless you were going for Six Sigma Well then I guess I was relying too much on something the chairman of Toyota or Honda said back in the day when Japanese auto makers were beating the Big Three to death on quality He said that even if a company only puts out one bad car per thousand if you are the person who bought that car then it seems like the failure rate was 100 If ASUS was making boards that simply failed that'd be one thing That they're taking down the CPUs in the process is a whole new problem

Back to you Steve
Is that Steve from Gamers Unboxed
Is that Wendell from Level1 Techs
Upvoted since tech Jesus is there
Behind the scenes at AMD Tech Day for Ryzen 7000 series as we went for world records with liquid nitrogen
Kyle Wendle and Steve all look so intense in this photo
oh shit is that Tech Jesus
Do you have a minute to hear the word of our lord and saviour Tech Jesus I also recognize the L1 Techs' guy I think
Wendell D
Hilarious to see a room full of so much passion and so little joy
Crysis 1 Bench or it doesn't count
Andrew over there like Fucking Nerds And red shirt is praying to Tech Jesus that they don't brick anything And then there's tech Jesus just OCing an AMD chip to 6 2ghz like beat this De8aurer
Tech Jesus appeared to bless their LN2 pot free them from cold bugs and grant them excellent scaling with temperature
what are they overclocking the new gpu or cpu or both
u Lelldorianx as the ln2
Major last supper vibes from this photo
Where from is this
Andrew with the red shoes looks like he gives zero fucks about what is happening along with the lady looking at his shoes lol
What am I doing here
The Last Supper if Jesus was a modern tech enthusiast
Love GN Steve easily the best out of the PC hardware youtubers
The woman in the back with the make looks like she would rather be anywhere else
Thats a nice Ryzen cap not gonna lie
Nice achievement there guys congrats
Is that whatshisface from GamerMeld
omg Tech Jesus hi
That lady is looking like she really regrets the sequence of events that led her there Just pushing down the urge to turn and run I can't even imagine the amount of YouTube stars toxicity in there
I knew tech Jesus was shilling for AMD after all that shade he was giving Nvidia this week Just kidding I know Nvidia deserved it
Amazing how LTT strays further and further away from hardcore tech and closer to unboxed therapy crap
Is that fucking steve
Why has no one built a liquid nitrogen injection rig Pouring nitrogen on the top of the cpu has to be the dumbest shit
Big props to production crew and backstagers in that picture who understand that COVID ain't over and are still wearing their mask
someone tell those two the president said the pandemic is over
I'll take my Liquid Nitro with two creams and one sugar please
LN2 overclocking is cool and and pricing for the RDNA 3 cards already
Wow what is this Did they get a sneak peak at Ryzen 7000
So do you guys do like computer things
Oh shit Sbeve back to you
Yes nerds red heartred heartred heart
strong Da Vinci vibes
Tech Jesus turning water into LN2
Some of my favourite tech people
Tech Jesus is weaving his spell
LN2 OC Last Supper
Steve Burke Plebs clearly thats Gamer s Nexus
I love how gritty OC scene is Everything just looks like a chaotic mess but so beautiful at the same time
It's a who's who of who's who up in there
Camera guys look tired lol
Is that the dude from Gamer Meld on the left
oh hi tech jesus
This is professional level geekiness
Looks like a cheap hotel room The floor is repulsive Even the PR woman looks ashamed Nerds feel at home though
The camera man is looking right into your soul
Why does this look like a Last Supper painting pose but with our pc folk
The true tech headz Steve n Wendel
gif giphy uCa2PBLWtcidy nice
So 8ghz
Tech Jesus
Look we dont want to mess this up what do we do Call the PC Jesus he is our only hope Steve enters the room
Is that the TECH JESUS
Is that Steve What's going on here flushed face
If Jesus turns water into wine does that mean that TechJesus turns water into liquid nitrogen
Lmao lady at the back grinning face with sweat
Thanks Steve
Alright I just joined this kind of community recently and I know I'm gonna look stupid for asking why do I see this everywhere
Stack to you Beve
Jesus has Ryzen 3 days
I don't trust him since the LTT drama he created And yes he created it
No that's Steve from Hardware Nexus
Hammer on box
Na that's Jays Gamers Linus Unboxed Nexus Hardware Tips Tech
No that s Steve from Jamers Nexus
If it's not it's damn red evil twin
And Marco from HotHardware and Paul from Tom's and Bitwit Kyle swoons
Good spot I remember him from the Tek Syndicate days Whatever happened to that
It's rare when I watch YouTube videos and think this is probably a good human in real life but Wendell gives me those vibes 100
Hi Steve
And Steve BASED
I believe it is I remember him talking about that watch in one of his recent shows
You mean Fatal1ty
Oh wow a Wild Wendell appears
Blessed be the dewar from which we pour this LN2 for it will allow for a mighty overclock
Is that Steve Burke from Gamer Nexus
I call him FatherBoard
Even the Gamer Meld guy is there I thought his channel was too small to be invited to things like this
When will the results be released
Should that guy be wearing protective gloves
I didn t notice Kyle lol
Yes someone from Intel dropped off some cake and punch about 20 minutes earlier and suddenly nobody is feeling very well atm for some
GamerNexus from GamersNexus
And the guy that used to be on Tek Syndicate
Dayum 6 5ghz
Nuts that's about the same as a 64core epyc Rome CPU in r23
The behind the scenes is that we were all taking notes and listening to the presenters explain how everything works Long days these events so people normally just try to grind out the notes details before crashing
Perhaps it's the look of absolute focus
The only woman apparently in the room is looking at the floor WTF am I doing here
You mean NNNNNEEEEERRRRDDDSSSSS
CPU and iGPU only
That s Wendell from L1 Techs He s John the Baptist in this scenario
6 5 all core
This is them trying to smash all of the records they just set on liquid cooling alone on the 7950x
The CPU is set to launch in a few days so I'd assume that's what they're doing
Judging from the cups everywhere they're making the greatest cold brew of all time
Seems too early for the GPU
AMD tech day event More to come next week
That lady's look made me laugh Good lord this is boring I imagine her thinking D
Poor Andrew far right looking like a deer in the headlights at his first AMD event p
Thanks p I've had a bunch of people asking about it Maybe I can talk to PR to get some made again Take care
Thanks so much More to come very 's my dream job since I was a kid
LTT was never hardcore tech to begin with
Yes
Unfortunately it's not though and there are three of them face with tears of joy
Sir the sapphire booth is across the hall
You can LITERALLY see it
Geforce RTX 3080 Tie
It's just a reference to Intel's terrible presentation at Computex 2021 The main host of GamersNexus is named Steve so he thought it was funny that one of the speakers in that Intel presentation said Back to you Steve t 457 Now GamersNexus adds that clip into their videos occasionally kind of like an inside joke
He adds it in as a cut scene from a keynote address Look out for it in some of his videos
How does it make him less trustworthy If anything it means that he will follow his principles no matter who they apply to and that's something that deserves utmost respect
I can agree to a small extent that he did strike the iron while it was hot with Linus' self created drama but at the end of the day they're both friends and now they both have written warranties for their screwdrivers In that sense I don't have an issue with it if they both don't have an issue with each other
No that's Steve from Nexus Tech Tips
Steve from Nexus gaming in HD
Along with Beve Sturk EDIT I 'd like to point out I didn't realise that Beve was actually in this chain when I replied
I thought that was bitwit but wasn't sure
Blocked him after he made those racist Chinese voice videos
Some other folks fucked it all up due to wanting to focus on shit no one cared about and there may or may not have been some sketchy financial shit going on that caused a breakaway
Logan kinda went off the rails I believe but I don't recall what happened specifically I'm still sad about it their content was top tier
There was a whole blow out over some financial thing and Wendell walked away There were a bunch of videos about it at the time Wendell seems to have done very well for himself Can't say the same for Tek Syndicate
Good spot He's Steve from GN He's literally in the photo grinning squinting face
I might be off base but I believe part of it was that Logan was funding production of a video game off the money meant for the whole channel Also Wendell wasn t edgy and goth enough like the rest of them and their cool dog
I thought he was in some sketchy anti vaxxer podcast Could be another dude but he's in my don't recommend list and I'm sure that was the reason

I assume when review embargo is lifted so on the 26th or a bit after
Counter intuitively it is more risky to wear gloves LN2 on contact with skin will instantly boil forming a gas barrier to the skin more commonly referred to as the Leidenfrost effect A glove would possibly negate that effect to an extent leading to a higher possibility of burns

Takes me back to their videos when Wendell wouldn't even reveal his face He was like a Tech Wilson from Home Improvement where all you could see is the top of his head over a monitor
Just looked at the channel and they barely pull in 10k views per video Very sad even though there was indeed some drama around it
Could be I did some brief googling and didn't find anything and honestly if he's not a vocal proponent of antivax and spreading mis information I'm not overly concerned about his personal views on it I think one of his co hosts is quite religious and those views tend to run in those circles so I could see that it would be something that fits but that's still fairly wild speculation of my part
Rumor is he works at Newegg
I know the mate as Tech Stoner
LMAO
Holy shit that s insane
6 5 ghz all cores what a beast
You'd need a glove that both has insulation ans is inpermeable to liquid nitrogen You can get such gloves but for acidental small spills it is indeed safer to rely on Leidenfrost effect
This is why when handling LN2 I always make sure to strip down completely naked first

I never heard of Uncle Roger I just get really extreme videos suggested on YouTube I have to be wary I don't want to get wrapped up in some extreme stuff
Hahah good times
I've seen some recent ones and they're not bad but Logan doesn't even do hardware reviews now So weird It used to be one of my favorite channels back in the day when Wendell was there
His co host was shouting anti vaxxer stuff He was brushing it off and not responding to it but i just didn't want to deal with that
That's his old job He actually builds pcs for Walmart
Also you should have sleeves that cover the gloves and based on his t shirt I think gloves that size might be hard to find Personally I'm more concerned about the shoes everyone is wearing
I actually reached my hand into a dewar filled with 3 4 of liquid nitrogen to retrieve a flower head that had broken off the stem and was sitting at the bottom of the dewar Mind you I reached in and back out quickly but Leidenfrost Effect for the win The flower head itself didn't have enough thermal mass to suck enough heat out of my hand to do anything in the time I was holding it

I saw that too but the counter offer from artisan builds was too good to say no
Sandles would be fine I think the real risk is creating an opportunity for the LN2 to pool in somebody's shoe Ideally they'd be wearing long pants that cover the opening of the shoe
Well AMD wouldn't mind if you buy a third 7900x lol Congratulations
Alright let's get this out onto a tray
I see you chose E over F
THIS TIME
This time Dude how rich are you to casually risk wasting 550 USD Twice
what does delied ing do
Wonder how the performance would be with thermal paste instead of liquid metal
It would've worked better with Stringjoy strings instead of Ernie Ball guitar strings
Wait why are people delidding
Jesus
You used D'Addarios for the first attempt huh
congrats
Try the Extra Slinky next time
Ryzen 7900X is the chip that never made any sense to me The pricing isn't great and you only get 12 working cores out of the 16 that are physically on the dies Not to mention they are spread across two chiplets
Use 7 gauge strings if you want them thinner Thinner
What is the point of deliding
Does this affects temps that much Before changing I might try this on my
Everyone else please if your doing this just wait for der8uers tool face with tears of joy
Wow thanks for the update I wouldn t have had the guts to try the second time
der8auer said you can easily get rid of the solder by dropping a small glob of liquid metal onto it and then wait a while
Someone who's done this kind of job isn't stupid in anyway
Nice use of Ernie strings Looks st my bass no no this ain't working face with tears of joy
Instant 20 C
How long it took you to remove that
Good choice on guitar strings
THIS TIME THERE'S MORE
Was it worth it
Looks like a piece of chocolate
why not just wait for the farmers delidding tool to come out
THE SEQUEL well done bro
Direct die cooling
you are truly mad
This looks SO MUCH easier to mount a heatsink fan on compared to the old Athlon XP where the die was about the size of a MicroSD card
Excuse my ignorance but what did you blur on the first picture
bruh
i did try this dental wire to cut the silicon adhesive really easy but despite all looked ok i got a problem with the CPU I was able to install windows but not goes past first reboot loop boot on a black screen so basically i think i fried my CPU when heating it to unsolder the IHS what strange is the CPU worked almost fine even memtest86 was running fine and in a last check i discovered a very small piece of kapton adhesive tape covering 2 or 3 pins under the CPU I removed it thinking it could goes better now but instead the motherbord Q LED on an X670E is just stuck on the red led CPU I think i got a problem with the integrated GPU and the little piece of tape was just enough to hide the GPU problem now the piece is removed the POST check on the CPU is probably crashing because the bad GPU Expensive mistake don't tell my i will not delid until a tested everything i was setting up a brand new rig from scratch motherboard ram ssd powersupply so not easy to know if there were others problems I already RMAed the motherboard but if the new CPU is working fine i will keep it I got 2x32 of RAM seems if you use 4 dimm the speed of the ram decrease a lot so i start with only two of the biggest size if all is ok i will add 2 more so i topped up to the max 128gig supported by the MB Then i will probably buy the delided from Der8auer but well 80 buck for one and use mixed method 8dental wire dor the glus delidder for the solder so no heat i will try to get some money back from the current offer from the ASUS cashback on TUF gaming product the MB and i could buy an new 1000W power supply with 50 off gif emote free emotes pack facepalm
Dumb why not just run the new processor Reverse engineering at its worst
Balls out Congrats
Ernie's Balls of Steel
Congrts Also why
Wasn't it shown that delidding Ryzen CPUs was marginal at best and not worth the risk compared to Intel CPUs
Nice Now EAT IT EAT THE HEAT SPREADER
but why
Fixing failures of AMD i see
For the people asking why de lid Because It s fun and keeps us off the streets at night
I'm hearing the only way to really use on one of these new extremely hot CPU's is to delid one Seems a bit extreme in order to really get the benefit out of one Did they make these CPU's so hot so that people would need to delid them Read another story where part of a guys plastic housing on his water pump actually melted from the heat
Honestly not worth the effort I m running a 7700x with the ice giant pro siphon elite max temp under gaming loads 76 degrees
Lmao and then you put it pin down on carpet Madlad
I almost fainted thinking it had pins like previous AMD
This time
How is the tone
Love the guitar strings lol
What purpose does this serve
Yay Congratulations For what
Seeing this in a vice just looks terrible lmao
So is the heat spreader only connected directly do the pcb As in it's not soldered to the Silicon If that's the case this is not a bad solution But if the HS was soldered directly to the silicon this is an awful approach
I tried to delid a CPU once and just like OP I broke it I never felt so stupid never again
Damn this dude casually drops thousands of on hardware I wish I was this rich
This might be stupid question why do people remove the lid If people want to remove it why AMD put it there
hi newbie like what is the purpose here ty
This time
Genuinely curious Why do we delid processors Is it for some kind of performance boost or is it like a cooling thing
it worries me that you said this time
Could someone explain what did OP do They removed the idk how to cal it metal thing from a CPU I'm not that dumb but why
Ok so hear me out We know the height of the CPU the heatsink die etc etc We also know de lidding this baby is no easy ft So why don't we just cut grind away at the top instead until we are super close to the die and then finish off the rest by hand sanding filing Surly this is more safe The heatsink when not connected to die should just pop off then
Wonder if d8er will release one of those delidding tools for the ryzen like he did with Intel
This time
Anyone just lapped it yet
Is that 3 CPU dies on that PCB is that 3 CPUs on one PCB
Put some nsfw tag man
I don't think that is a dental floss
Ooh neat to see you use a guitar string for this DerBauer always makes it seem like some special gear is needed for delidding
Unless I'm remembering incorrectly the old Athlon XP cpu's came 'de lidded' from the factory I vaguely remember putting thermal paste directly onto the die and popping a heatsink on top no trouble Why can't they be like that these days Good times
How did you get the ihs off after the guitar string
mate I respect the dedication but you spent all this effort and had to buy two of these cpus just to get a good delid and like a little better thermals performance when ryzen 7000 vcache is coming soon with much better performance
I couldn't do it if I did like you I'm on 12 60 strings LMAO
Noob question why delid
If you can afford to fuck up a 500 dollar processor you can afford a semi decent milling machine to duplicate the delidding jigs that work so well from that german guy on youtube He makes neat shit
What kind of temps do you get now
I can't figure out why on earth AMD would make such a thick I E poor lid design Intel tried that recently and apparently AMD didn't pay attention Unless they're planning to release a whopper of a 3D
This time Tell you what act like it did Buy another And ship it to me
how come the lid is shaped weird this time
May I ask why
This time
Direct die cooling
So what's the point of doing this Just for fun or
Any particular reason behind using a 9 gauge or did you just not have any of those crazy thin heavy metal shredding E strings laying around I feel like those ultra thin strings would work even better than this
As a newb to all of this wouldn't AMD be now aware of the thermals being too high and so therefore would create a revision to how they make their CPUs so that customers wouldn't have to resort to delidding it themselves
I added my observation under this thread I found out my 7900x cpu gets around 14700 score in time spy with win 11 With win 10 my score is around 15700 Everything was the same power plan core isolation off When I looked at detailed results in 3d mark website I found out that with win 11 avarage CPU clock was even a bit higher Everything else was the same Any ideas
sick
I'd do the same but what did you do for retention Edit nvm
I killed one already with a cracked die and I'm doing a second one yes I'm an idiot No matter how hot I get it with the heat gun hit 115 and didn't go higher the IHS will not budge Even ran floss a couple more times through to ensure the seal was completely broken Has anyone done this successfully where the IHS just falls off with enough heat or is there a need to pry a little bit
I was just about to say AMD is probably sitting there hoping that he continues doing this for the whole fucking stockface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
Nice

Extreme overclockers definitely do Folks like Roman Hartung and Ian Cutress will dump tons of cash into going extra lengths in getting things just right It is elite level engineering and requires extraordinary efforts to get top tier results in the leaderboards Plus you may quip over 550 but that's still way cheaper than the 10 000s that auto enthusiasts dump into that hobby at the drop of a hat
Don t get into the saltwater hobby There are coral so rare they go for thousands Lights that cost 500 1000 each Sumps skimmers powerheads Easily will cost more than a single top of the line gaming rig
Although this seems extreme it's also nothing I remember when the 9900ks released Some people bought them in packs or bought from Silicon Lottery RIP for more than double the price just so they can get a golden binned CPU
Is this a serious question You don't have to be very rich to be able to risk 550
I don't think you know what rich actually means

Improves thermal performance Some say you can drop load temps 20 degrees deliding the 7950x I will be giving it a shot
On direct die it makes a much bigger difference compared to on top of the IHS
Thermal paste isn't meant to be that thick and liquid metal is much more conducive
All LM or any other thermal related mod does is move the heat transfer cooling bottleneck elsewhere You never get rid of it completely If you want to move the bottleneck away from the TIM though you have to use LM Actual temp variables are hard to quantify as it depends how much your TIM was bottlenecking the rest of your cooling setup in the first place and also how many other thermal bottlenecks you have in your setup how bad they are In other words the stronger your cooling solution is the less other thermal bottlenecks exist in your setup the more you potentially stand to achieve by using LM If you're willing to risk delidding a brand new CPU that no delidding tool currently exists for You're probably not then going to deliberately cause a TIM related thermal bottleneck by using a standard paste Even in the very best case scenario for a paste it's still not going to be as good as LM Which for enthusiast level XOC stuff like this is completely unacceptable
Nevermind I am dumb Forget my previous post
Cause ihs is thicc
Thermal performance
some people just enjoy it
Right I was thinking Have mercy Uncle Jesse
Thicc
Interesting I didn t know that Regarding the cores do they disable them to get you to pay more or what Is the die the same as the model above
L3 stays even with the 4 cores disabled that can edge out a bit of performance the question is whether it's worth the latency penalty to access the other die in case the programm needs 8 cores
You could have more OC room because the thermal density is 25 less
I mean it's lower price per core than the 7700x and 7600x which are both around 50 a core the 7900x is 45 a core and the 7950x is 43 a core It's still fundamentally 150 less in price and if you want more than 8 cores and don't want to spend 700 then it's great It's certainly better value than the 8 and 6 core It also means you have 8 cores to saturate any game and then 4 more cores for anything else you run I tend to almost always have other stuff open on other screens while gaming and moving to a 5900x everything felt smoother less hitching in games when a stream video decides it needs to yoink some cpu power for a second when loading or decoding something if and when I do want to do some video editing it's considerably faster than a 6 8 core options and for better value per core I'm trying to work out what the issue with it is if you think pricing isn't great because it's the second best value empirically but imo best value overall because having more than 8 cores gives you overhead but 16 cores is a waste for most people
wait 7 gauge is thinner than 9 gauge
Better cooling
Marginally better cooling at the gamble of paying 2x or even 3x the cost of your processor Totally worth it s
5 fps more
10 20C drops in temperatures at max load overall better cooling performance
IHS is too fat delidding gives you 20 c better temps even if you use regular thermal paste
The shield on the 7000 series is pretty thick I ve heard temps drop quite a bit
Isn't the 5000 series soldered Which means unless you have absolutely faith in yourself and know exactly what you're doing you won't be delidding one
Direct die cooling improves temperatures quite a bit especially on Ryzen 7000 since the IHS is so thicc On Ryzen 5000 it's something like 10 15C on 7000 more like 20C less
My understanding and this comes from watching YouTube videos so take it with a grain of salt is that in order for AMD to keep compatibility with older cooling solutions AMD needed to make sure the height of that lid or the interface height was the same as it was on the older Ryzen series I believe going from one pin configuration to another changed that height by a few MM which meant that this lid had to be much thicker on the new Ryzen series I am not sure exactly of the temp change reasoning for why it is but because of this thick lid the temps stay higher which is why these new CPUs run at such high temps Some YouTubers have been getting significant heat drops from delidding these newer CPUs This obviously doesn't apply to the last gen CPUs so I don't think it would benefit you as much as the newer models
Not worth it in my opinion You can achieve great temps with vcore voltage offset and negative curve optimizer I got mine with just all core negative curve setting not fine tuned and 0 125v I can run R23 with 70c peak on a Noctua NH D14 and get 26k points on R23 running with WINE on Linux
5950 is not going to see the same gains as 7000 series it has a better ihs design
Not long About 15 minutes going slowly
That's too bad I'm sorry you had issues I've now performed 7 delids using the heat gun method All worked perfectly I do use a temp gun on the CPU to make sure it doesn't go above 115C I also test all equipment before doing a delid as I have received defective equipment before Good luck
For zen3 and earlier maybe but not for zen4
watch derbauers video 20 degree drop in temp
Uhh my 7900x runs at 16C while I am doing my everyday tasks on my PC Not sure where you heard it s a crazy hot processor man shrugging light skin tone
It doesn't have
That's not carpet It's a clean microfiber cloth
Oh you didn't kill this one Good job I guess
I'm also very much newbie as well but I know maybe extreme oveeclocking Like hitting those 6Ghz or more frequencies Idk that's just idea
Delidding a cpu allows for better cooling options People use liquid metal which is more thermally conductive over the stock TIM This gives more thermal headroom for overclocks For the recent Ryzen CPUs the only reputable source showed a 20c drop in temperature which is massive considering the thermal target being 95c Undervolting can also lead to really great temperature reductions while allowing the same boost speeds Only reason you would care to do this is for XOC or making your system run generally cooler This is not something many people do
I think he will he delidded one in a recent video with a prototype

That's a low figure for gun enthusiasts burning powder and bullets at the range to find the perfect match for their rifles paying hundreds of dollars for a couple springs that cost a couple bucks to manufacture Hi I'm a gun enthusiast and I have a money problem
Plus you may quip over 550 but that's still way cheaper than the 10 000s that auto enthusiasts dump into that hobby at the drop of a hat Yeah it's actually a pretty cheap hobby compared to photography and audiophile equipment just naming these two as they are relatively common hobbies
Roman Hartung He's also producing products for extreme overclockers as well as producing videos related to it So it's more of an investment for him Ian Cutress I'm not aware that Dr techtechpotato is an extreme overclocker Did he do any delidding and mods publicly before
Ya and when they dial the boost just a little too high they write off an engine and sometimes the whole car Makes OC on a CPU look rather tame and extremely cheap by comparison
As an auto enthusiast don t you bring us into this
My fish tank doesn't even need maintenance been running for years simply adding water I started w a good active substrate and lots of plants though Salt water looks so much cooler but it's nice not having to do anything besides look at the tank As a bonus my pleco is healthy still and I don't even remember how many years ago we got it I should give it some more wafers I suppose it's been just feeding off the tank for
used to have 4 40k armies as well sold them The arguement isn't how much you spend on 's how much you're willing to risk in this case 550 USD wasting I can always resell my 't unless he's willing to screw people over
So you just put the paste straight on the chip
Why is it made with a lid then
Key note thermal performance The actual performance gain is not that much
Only because the IHS is stupid thick for partial AM4 cooler compatibility it really shouldn't be that big of a difference most of the time but AMD dropped the ball hard with the IHS
I'm really curious to see if this still holds true in a month with more data AMD used a particularly think IHS to maintain compatibility with AM4 coolers It might be a rare case of being too good to your customer If it is that big of a deal AMD could see some significant gains by breaking AM4 cooler compatibility I really want to see the 7000G line DDR5 will help but I want to know if they can use their stacking tech to add an APU without sacrificing die space or just a ton of cache It's probably not remotely viable but I desperately want to know what happens if you squeeze some kind of FSR3 core onto a 7600G All this temporal upscaling SLI except the 2nd video card is virtual is cool but it's wasted on high end GPUs Squeeze it into the low end Are there any rumors or leaks re Ryzen 7 APUs
It doesn t need to be thick since it s contacting the die The best thermal transfer is with more heatsink on heat part Ideally two perfectly flat items I just wonder how many c of a different it would make maybe 5 or 10
what thermal bear liquid metal 73 W mk thermal bear kryonaut extreme 14 2 W mk the difference is night and day stop lying to people de8auers test is null and void tested paste with typical install and then liquid metal after delid he should either have run paste for both tests or liquid metal for both tests he knows for a fact people are stupid and by faking his test using paste before and liquid metal after he could skew the results to sell more delid kits that's the only reason to run such a biased test
Hoping they come out with some sort of lapping tool so we can at least make the ihs thinner
Depends what is it used for for benches sure for gaming too much for rendering too little
they can be cores with defects that get lasered off however if the yields are really good so there aren't enough chips with defective cores to sustain demand they can even laser off cores of perfectly working 16 cores
No it's thknner
yes 7 gauge just means its 0 007mm thick and 9 gauge is 0 009mm thick
The temp drop depends on the CPU but for the 7950x it was around 20C Most would consider it not worth it but some would
Marginally I think a 20C drop isn't marginal at all
a bit 20 fkin degrees 20 without any other mods They plan to use a THICK IHS to help some compatibility to the AM4 cooler but that was absolutely useless because not many AM4 pieces will fit on an AM5 board
This one was soldered as well
Would it make sense for the CPU manufacturers to make a more cooling friendly lid
I would take that 20c with a grain of salt its been 1 guy that's reported that but he's going to be selling a kit for doing it so there's going to be some bias to skew results Overall the ihs is thick but it's not so thick that it's going to keep the cpu from cooling if anything it would just make it take longer to get hot and cool back down
thickness is not the reason for liquid cooling and after deliding tested direct die liquid cooling with LIQUID METAL test is null and void completely unscientific either he should use paste before after to get consistent accurate results or liquid metal before and after he lied to everyone and its doing the internet a huge disservice for his bullshit
Yeah just do a Google search AMD temps for the new cpu's You will find a lot of stiff Glad you're not having issues tho

I find it interesting how gamers especially PC gamers seem to think it s a very expensive hobby Obviously it depends on your financial situation entirely But as far as hobbies go Gaming is very good value per unit of entertainment Guns Not a gun guy so this is just my understanding can approach or eclipse 1 round for even common calibres Let alone parts for esoteric guns like you mentioned Cars Just fucking driving anywhere will cost you 10 let alone the cost of parts and tuning and maintenance Skiing Be prepared to spend your entire day and a couple hundred between gas lift pass food Mountain biking Imagine skiing but you can do it 12 months of the year and everything is stupid expensive Hell the most expensive PC you could reasonably want without just buying things that are pointlessly expensive like the olden days of quad titan SLI just for the clickbait will cost you less than a nice carbon frame Not trying to shame anyone every hobby is a waste of money and what you can afford with your disposable income will vary You spend the money and in return you get pleasure from it But gaming is fantastic value comparatively and I think that should be appreciated Embroidery is incredible value for money if anyone is looking for an extra hobby Anyway adderall post over I have poor impulse control and too many hobbies and not enough money

I'm not aware that Dr techtechpotato is an extreme overclocker Did he do any delidding and mods publicly before It was in his bio when he started working at AnandTech some years ago I believe he had hit number 2 in the overclocking charts at one point I am not sure if Ian still does the extreme overclocking these days Maybe someone should ask him
I mean look at all the people who just bought a shiny new 1600 GPU today to play video games Any one of these people could have wasted 550
Can confirm i am both bad with money and cant afford anything But im not being too hard on myself because i feel like im just starting out
You would use liquid metal It's a whole process that requires specialized mount equipment and an open loop
Most who go this far would use liquid metal TIM but you could use regular paste directly on the dies That's how it used to be done before integrated heat spreaders were a thing
This is also known as direct die Becareful when applying force to mount cooler on the naked dies Laptops usually are direct die But the mounting mechanism is low impact
A few reasons The integrated heat spreader is a lot more tolerant of imperfect heatsink placement contact Without an IHS if the heatsink is not perfectly level and making perfect contact you're much more likely to have overheating issues leading to crashes or even to permanent chip damage The IHS spreads the heat over a larger area reducing this issue Also without an IHS the risk of crushing or otherwise damaging the chip increases exponentially The silicon is actually quite fragile and the IHS protects it from eg getting a bump while the heatsink is being installed and being cracked So basically the IHS gives you a lot of extra safety and user friendliness at the cost of a few degrees in max temp If you are a real enthusiast who has the time skill and resources to invest into removing the IHS and very carefully adding liquid metal and seating the heatsink exactly right the tolerances are in the micrometre range and you're happy to risk destroying your chip it can be worth doing But if CPUs didn't come with an IHS an average user would probably break the chip or at least install it with a very poor thermal result 9 times out of 10
so people dont crack their chips while mounting the cooler CPUs used to be lidless with only small 'cushions' at the corners of the substrate to give it some protection but people were
It didn't used to be eg Athlon
I said thermal performance and it does matter if you want to OC
Yea I feel like it was just the cheapest solution lol
pump out would be a problem with thin paste Outside of that maybe a couple degrees max
The numbers are super different but the real world temperature difference isn t really that big You can look at the thermal conductivity numbers for aluminum and copper conclude that aluminum s is half of copper s which it is and then assume that you re going to see a huge difference in temps and that aluminum is worthless In reality it s like a couple degrees Celsius if that Source former EK fluid gaming loop owner now the owner of an EK all copper custom loop
Wil u carry out said mentioned test for said stupid people
make the ihs thinner real men make the die thinner
Tbf you can do this now with the right materials It's just a PITA and requires a lot of patience lol
ah sorry my reading comprehension failed me again
The hell That's the opposite of how everyone else used the measurement 'gauge'
We only have a single source for this claim so far let's wait what the consensus is before we start repeating that everywhere
Its cheaper to pay for silicon lottery golden sample and undervolt than risking the whole product
70c vs 90c does end up being less significant as the higher temps cause higher voltages which then causes higher temps That's why if you lower the voltage with an offset you only lose single digit numbers in performance the lower heat causes the voltages to mean more It's still not marginal they were being sarcastic but I still wouldn't say it's a massive drop
They stumbled into a situation where maintaining AM4 cooler mounting compatibility required thicker IHS to be the least bad option
Yes but it makes more sense to maintain cooler compatibility
The issue with the IHS isn't the thickness at all it's that the cores are positioned at the edge of the IHS and so can't use the full dissipation cone through the IHS into the heatsink
liquid metal not worth 20C even between god's asscheeks
you just cant take an L can you jesus
op's previous post was the picture of that dead CPU
Why would Amazon replace it Unless they glued the IHS back on and told them it s defective they re gonna know and their agents should deny the return upon receipt of the item Then again working in retail I ve exchanged prebuilt pcs when a customer broke the glass side panel they put it down on tile while opening the case to remove the packing material so the person probably doesn t get paid nearly enough to care Amazon s problem I guess
maybe delete the accusation then
the front fell off
Lmao
what did you do Richard
Nah they undoubtedly glued it back together broken
Goes great with menu number 4 heated on a rock or something
No no no You make a Tabasco sauce slurry with the coffee and rub it in your eyeballs That's the field expedient experience right there I was more so quoting the mannerisms of the MRE unboxing guy though
reddit is weird 10k karma user just happens to be around
Warhammer 40k is definitely up there in costs as well
Simple I'm poor so everything seems expensive
Gaming is very cost effective as a hobby but the distinction is people that choose to get way more PC than they need for the game they re playing overclock to give them like a couple FPS difference at best and do stuff like risk 500 dollar CPUs for again something that doesn t improve the gaming experience in a measurable way So in that sense the hobby isn t GAMING it s PC MODDING
Can confirm I have 3 mountain bikes cheapest was 4k Crack is cheaper do crack be rich
I game snow board and mountain bike I can confirm my PC is my cheapest hobby I just bought a 6k bike and that is mid range for a mountain bike
I find it interesting how gamers especially PC gamers seem to think it s a very expensive hobby Yeah there is a definite case of I have low disposable income so I am going to tell everyone about it and try to make them feel guilty for buying expensive things mentality on these boards
Spoken like a true gamer living in his mom's basement
The only way PC gaming gets extremely expensive these days is if you get hooked into the world of gambling 2 0 called loot boxes that has plagued the industry I am not an MMORPG player and never will be and similarly I have yet to put forward a single cent towards any game subscription or in game points If I buy a game it's a one time purchase and that's that free and clear If there is a game that has a loot box like system like Star Wars Battlefront 2 I will make their system play to my favor and get points just playing and having fun for the bonus content
I have RC cars multiple worth well over 1k and part of the fun is seeing how high I can send them I to the air and try to land them
Well mountain biking might make u 5 slower on a 5 year old bike but a 5 year old PC will leave you in the
Anime Well before streaming every DVD blueray is like 55 minimum imported from japan or bought in japan stuff is expensive over there and lets not get started on all the figurines and gundam models etc some of those can even get in the 1000s THough if your like me and just stream on Crunchyroll and don't bother with all the other extras above then it CAN be a cost effective hobby now thanks to streaming
I got into cars years before I got into computers Still spend way more money on old shitboxes than I care to admit but yes muchhhhh more expensive than computers The cost of my clutch and flywheel alone could build a decent gaming PC
As a gamer 3d print enthusiast photographer and car guy yup gaming is by far the cheapest hobby I have
right computers is what i do to burn the time and save money to do the other expensive things
luckily with guns buying ammunition en masse helps with cost problems bought a 500 cartridge case of 7 62x54mm for 300 usd got loads of range rounds now
I got bit by the astrophotography and astronomy bug a few years back It'
I could have built two or three custom loop balls to the wall gaming PCs with 12900KS CPUs and SLI 3090ti and the fastest RAM known to mankind for what I've got into my titanium road bike with electronic shifting and custom carbon wheels plus other upgrades Yeah by contrast my current gaming rig 5900x 3080ti overkill custom loop was a bargain When I consider the money I've dumped into a game like Warthunder over the last six years maybe 800 1k it seems obscene until I imagine how much I would have spent if I'd used that time doing literally anything else
Hi I'm into cars motorcycles dirt bikes mountain bikes snowboarding guns home theaters lawn care and PC gaming I can confirm that PCs are the cheapest hobby on that list by far except for snowboarding and I have a 5900X 3080 system With computers the cost of entry might be high but the maintenance costs over time and consumables are extremely low With other hobbies they constantly have consumables that you need to pay for on top of high costs of entry It's why I don't mind putting together a new PC every couple years since it's still way cheaper than my other hobbies
And half of that money is going towards things like 10 000 audiophile grade HDMI cables gold plated CDs and other things that don't actually improve anything I call myself a bit of an audiophile but there are some really gullible folks out there
Even if we talk about the more budget audiophiles some would casually buy 500 wiring for their IEMs
most people under 30 Ahhh to be young I make like 55k gross Canadian dollars that's above the Canadian median 't risk destroying a 750 again canadian just so I can get a slight performance boost thermals from it When I was in my 20s I'd have done it caus I didn't have much to pay for besides hobbies fun but at almost mid 40's yeah there's other stuff that eats at the monthly budget in 2019 I've built my current rig 3900x 5700xtx 32 gb ram 1 tb MP600 for around 2500 canadian and that's for replacing my 2010 rig Phenom II X6 R6780 crossfire 16 gb ram 60gb ssd which lasted quite a
oh I assume this is really for enthusiasts then What is the end game of this process
it doesn t have to be open loop I think Buildzoid tested it with a closed loop cooler if I remember correctly but yea you would need a very good cooler to take advantage of it
Sounds like a good feature to have for consumer CPUs out of the box Genuine question why do consumer CPU's not have this done already to them Too expensive Time consuming 20 degrees seem like a lot
i don't think you would put liquid metal direct onto silicon that stuff is very abrasive cant find the right word
It makes sense lapping direct dies on desktop to apply even pressure across the die as is done with GPUs
But if CPUs didn't come with an IHS an average user would probably break the chip or at least install it with a very poor thermal result 9 times out of 10 In the early 2000s AMD Athlon CPUs didn't come with an IHS and a cracked or chipped die was something that would show up on tech forums with some regularity People overtightening the heat sink mount or simply installing it wrong could easily destroy a CPU in this way As an added bonus the lack of IHS also meant that with the limited or absent thermal management features of that period starting a CPU without a cooler installed would pretty much instantly let the magic smoke out DIY PC building was a bit more complicated back then
Are you going to use the razor method to scrape off the old metal solder I would be most nervous about that lol Please post full OC perf results once you get it directly cooled
Stuff like noctua nt h2 and kingpins paste would be good for that They re pretty thick
Copper and aluminum transfer heat internally differently as you know however they also RETAIN heat differently Aluminum loses heat much faster than copper making it better at dissipating with a lower delta T however aluminum is harder to warm up so using copper to act as the short duration thermal sink and aluminum as the longer duration dissipation medium works out better than a pure copper heatsink which will warm up more slowly but dissipate the energy slower as well
Yeah and it s hard to know when to stop as well besides taking measurements There s an intel die lapping tool When you get to the right height it starts to scratch the frame and you stop then
i didnt invent it im sure someone else probably knows why it's like that
I think it's fair to point out that one example if you make it clear it's just one example
Derbaur He's one of the best
Soldered means soldered to the dies using indium based solder The edges are always glued The alternative is to use regular thermal paste instead of indium solder which Intel did for quite a while
It definitely is you can see leftover solder on the dies in the first and final picture There also would be zero need for a heat gun if it was just silicone glue holding it the guitar string would've handled that
I wonder if it would have been feasible to just make the LGA mount on the board a bit higher to allow for a thinner IHS At the same time they cleanly broke compatibility with their previous platform I don't know why it was so important to retain cooler compatibility over offering an option to use DDR4 I feel like DDR4 even if requiring high spec DDR4 compatibility would have been a much more welcome effort than the cooler
I dont think so Efficiency compatibility Oh great I can still use my old cooler but it has terribad performance due to the said compatibility RIGHT N
Using an offset mount to position a cooler above the cores on the IHS still produces very inferior results compared to direct die
All I said is to take it with a grain of salt looking at the the graphs that where posted it just seems fishy that they line are basicly clones that are just temp shifted if the ihs was as bad as he claims there should be a big difference in the temperature change curves I'm not saying he's trying to scam ppl or anything there's not any kind of market for him to profit from it I just think there is something else that effected the results he saw especially since his starting temp seems high my cpu with no load hovers between 30 40c

excactly how much is it worth on these chips you don't know neither do i and neither does de8auer which is what makes the 20C number completely worthless It's nearly certainly not 20C maybe it's 12C maybe it's 16C maybe he tigthened the heatsink more the second time and gained another 4c maybe it was only 5 or 8C literally no one knows
You
Maybe because they don t check half the stuff that gets sent back to them
That s not very typical I d like to make that point
ROFL Done a lot of field expedient MRE eats dumping creamer powder into the cocoa powder adding just enough water to stir it into pudding eat Squeeze the cheese or peanut butter directly into my mouth dump the coffee crystals into my mouth I recall gnawing my way through the old dehydrated beef or pork patties without reconstituting them first Kinda like chewing on a crunchy dried sponge that had been soaked in bouillon before dehydrating Good times
You'd be better off with a coke habit
Lol it s not tooo bad if you stick to spin offs like kill team Doesn t help my hobbies are mountain biking Warhammer photography and pc gaming nothing is cheap in my hobby world
Gotta switch to battletech it's way cheaper 'cause minis are optional
That's my secret Cap I'm always poor OP and me surely
Ah yes the poor hobbyist Also known as the masochist
So in that sense the hobby isn t GAMING it s PC MODDING Or like me whose hobby when I'm first building or overhauling or upgrading a machine is focused on PC MODDING until I'm finally satisfied with it then fall back to actually use it for gaming and other things There's nothing wrong with that either Overhauling tweaking modding one's PC is just as valid a part of the hobby as actually using it for anything
Great analysis
PC enthusiast is almost a separate hobby from gaming enthusiast They go together for sure but I think for some people building the PC and overclocking tuning is more fun than actually playing games on it
people spend extra on high tech skis when their skills barely justify a used beginner set people spend 6 figures on sports cars that will never see a track or speed limit higher than 75mph people spend high 4 figures on full suspension badass mountain bikes they'll mostly just ride around neighborhoods and trails
I'm into cars motorcycles bowling golf tech in general and obviously PCs All of these can take lots of money if done up but my cheapest hobby is bowling followed by PCs Now serious bowlers will flip those numbers pretty rapidly but any of you look at the cost of a set of golf clubs and a country club membership Needless to say I don't have new clubs or a CC membership Even still golf gets 'spensive fast Also I like older cars and Bikes as they are simpler The large tablet style dashes in new cars and Bikes are ugly in my opinion and I like the raw feeling of driving riding without all the assists Still fancy parts ain't cheap and the inflation in both of those areas is real since COVID
Pardon us mere peasants that have watched GPU prices double over the past few generations and are getting priced out of the hobby that we love
I ll have you know I live at ground level
And half of that money is going towards things like 10 000 audiophile grade HDMI cables gold plated CDs and other things that don't actually improve anything I call myself a bit of an audiophile but there are some really gullible folks out there yeah that's just guillible morons believing in homoeopathy not actual audiophiles
There are useless gimmicky things in all hobbies areas of interest I used to sell PCs and related accessories Gold plated cables have a very high profit margin and almost no added ROI Golf balls of different covers and clubs with angled necks to fix your swing none of that actually works Fixing swing requires coaching training and practice One of the best things you can do for improving technique in any physical activity without a coach is record yourself in slow motion and watch what you are doing Things that you think are right will surprise you how wrong they are and you know where to focus your efforts
I call myself a bit of an audiophile but there are some really gullible folks out there That's why I loved reading InnerFidelity and Tyll Hertsens when it came to headphones and now love reading AudioScienceReview and Amir for all things audio which is kind of a leveled up InnerFidelity 2 0 plus speakers and speaker amps and receivers for me free of the rose tinted audiophoolery subjective voodoo that plagues that industry and full of objective no nonsense analysis The fact we can get 100 200 DAC and amp combos that objectively outstrip and outperform ones costing 10 000s is why I love AudioScienceReview Expose those gold diggers for who and what they are really are
I make enough money for the year I'm not willing to waste that amount
Idk why there's a full on thread of people wanking about how much money they make relative to the hardware they buy When did PC gaming become an elite hobby that lesser people shouldn't have access to
Shoot I went to a casino for a bachelor party as a joke for all of us and dropped 100 dollars in 50 minutes I was so full of anxiety of how wasteful I was And lo everyone around me is dropping thousands at 25 dollar blackjack and crap tables I am like HOW
It depends on your goals Some people want to use that thermal headroom to gain some increased clock frequencies I want to run a very cool and quiet build
Well by increasing the gap before thermal throttling one can push the chips frequency to insane levels from it's base I think I saw gamers nexus push it to 7Ghz using liquid nitrogen which is literally a generational jump in Freq by just cooling it Although I don't know the technical details of how this works
Nah it was an open loop Edit I was wrong about buildzoid testing with open loop
too easy to break the unprotected die look at early 2k cpus and how often they were returned due to that
Cost and complexity Most consumers aren t using open loop cooling and you can t just slap paste on it and call it a day you need specialized mounting hardware as well Also 20F is a pretty extreme example
The massive difference this gen is due to the thick ihs Past CPUs haven't seen such large gains
You do use liquid metal
It's ok If you catch the magic smoke really quickly you can put it back in
Remember those copper shims you used to be able to get to make it harder impossible to crack the die during installation
I can confirm this amd chips from 2000s had no thermal shut off and could easily hit 300c tom's hardware still has a video up v NxNUK3U73SI v NxNUK3U73SI I had cracked a few edges on amd chips from amd's early days and anything goes water cooling days some of which could be fixed up with a pencil by scraping off the broken cracked edge and coloring it in with a pencil It was already a dead chip so there was no harm in connecting those broken edge traces as long as it wasn't parts of the logic with pencil and cleaning up the dust with some tape Little did I know that pencil and scotch tape is actually a process that can be used to create
Having built my first PC in the P3 Athlon era I really dont feel direct die cooling is that dangerous with the screw down coolers we have today Back then most coolers had a retention clip that went on to the socket itself You need to use a screwdriver with considerable force to hook the retention clip on to the plastic tabs on the side of the socket If your screwdriver slipped you risk damaging the motherboard And some people would actually press down hard on the cooler thinking that will make the clip go on easier and that is when cores started to crack Modern Chips also has thermal shutoffs and throttling So even if there is no IHS or Heatsink it should not burn up
It required more reading of instructions Posting a question to the web with a decent likelihood of a near instantaneous response wasn t an option back then
I think I'm gonna try applying liquid metal to get off Ive seen way too many posts of people cutting capacitors off
nt h2 and kryonaut are some of the runniest pastes on the market They're the exact opposite of what you'd need
That makes perfect sense for a mixed metals loop Sadly though the EKFG kits are alu only Thanks for explaining though I didn t know that stuff
Hm No I have both a regular aluminum and a full copper one Same design There's about 8 c 10 difference between them with a prime95 1h test fixed fan's speed Unless you consider this short duration
power transfer from a heat source to ambient only cares about the delta temp between the heat source and the ambient So 30 33 is way more than 1 when ambient is at 20 C
This is very true and I could definitely see a market for this sort of tool for 7000 series in particular The other annoying thing about lapping is you need to make sure the surface you're mating it to is just as flat The results speak for themselves but the legwork is real haha
But just a single fallible man
Yeah that seems like the smart way It's only a mm difference so I don't see a technical reason why they couldn't If I had to guess somebody messed up and drawings got signed off and sent to vendors before they realized and they had to make it up on the IHS
To most consumers the compatibility is a bigger deal than marginally lower performance The actual temperature is irrelevant and only the final performance difference matters which afaik is tiny Also there's no terribad performance Der8auer used liquid metal in his tests and that means it's definitely different than just a thinner IHS 5 10C or rather 0 5 performance probably means nothing to 99 of their customers Edit
Coolers are good enough for most usecases even with the fatter ihs I'm of the opinion of keeping compatibility over perfomance here seeing performance isn't really lost you just get a hotter chip
Still helps though and that's not what I am talking about anyway it's the fact that there's actually LESS metal in the IHS above the CCDs than there is with Zen 3 AMD could move the CCDs 1mm and it would help quite a bit Of course you would still see 95 degrees but performance would be higher The thick IHS has benefits that can only be measured on the order of microseconds they would be greater if the cores were more centrally located on the package
I just meant that LM on IHS doesn't bring 20C vs paste I'd believe direct die can be 20C better in this case just because IHS on AM5 is fkn thicc and the heat density is so high
my bad didn't mean to start no static get it i'll see myself to the door
Yeah they just repack it and sell it on
Sounds like the US Army MREs are catching up the other countries when you mentioned freeze dried dehydrated meat I loved the Canadian and Australian ones the best just for that reason Just add boiling water and wait 15 or so minutes We all know how having time all the time in the military ebbs and flows from day to day Man I do miss me some military issued meals though baby Airborne Infantry for life baby 11C3P

The joke meme in my country are like we're not the target market or there's no expensive product only you're too poor for them
Yep absolutely It s like I don t know having building go carts as a hobby and also having cart racing as a hobby
That s more akin to gamers that buy a 2000 dollar prefab pc to play medium end games Better analogy would be any of your examples above where someone is building and tweaking those things themselves Like someone that enjoys working on their sports car and tweaking it and keeping it immaculate or someone that loves building and modding bikes
This is exactly what I am talking about with this peasant crap Obviously I am not saying that no one has a right to complain about the prices rising we all hate the prices rising but I am talking about the many Redditors specifically referring to others for being rich for buying a new card or just generally criticizing their purchasing choices No matter what your level of income is low or high just have some dignity about your situation and focus on criticizing the companies who raise these prices and not those who can afford to buy them
In '99 an nVidia TnT2 Ultra cost about 230 US and a Voodoo 3 3000 was about 180 those cards were at the top of their it's 1600 for the top 's become an elite hobby to stay at peak performance I'd say the trend began around the time of the GeForce 6 's prices caus they had a near monopoly With that 'm pretty satisfied with my 5700 XT
Oh well I'm glad you succeeded and hope you continue to enjoy
You won't be able to Zen4 is designed to boost until it hits 95 C You give it more headroom and it will just boost further to eat up that headroom
Wow does that do anything to the use life of the CPU As primarily a gamer is it generally practical
It's actually 20 C not 20 F v y jaS FZcjI Most of the drop comes from the ISH being very thick this time an attempt to keep cooler compatibility
What s thicker than those Nth2 seemed thick when I put it on my waterblock
Full aluminum vs full copper the copper wins in most designs The mixed use of them is preferred which is why it's so common
Y 's the exact same construction Silicone glue holding the edges of the IHS to the substrate and indium solder attaching the IHS to the CPU dies and providing thermal conductivity OP's 4th image shows how he removed the soldered IHS with the following caption Once the silicone has been cut I used a heat gun and temp gun to get the lid off 225F 107C did its job in about a minute Silicone strips protect the CPU while heating EDIT Counted the images starting from 0 habit Changed to counting from 1
Derbauer delidded a different model and an engineering sample Not sure why you are so passionate about arguing with a stranger on the internet about this but I'm going to go touch grass now enjoy the rest of your day
Marginally lower performance 20 C less heat when delidded is marginally lower performance to you Okay then EDIT Do you think I would achieve close results to der8auer by applying liquid metal over the ihs
Oh yeah I also built my defender from the ground up lol so cars too
Wait are you me Warhammer check Airsoft check 3d printers I ve 2 on the go as we speak Pc gaming check Just throw in mountain bikes and photography lol
Well at least you can 3D print minis for Warhammer
Welp at least we can always pretend that we do it to save the environment What my hardware is not OLD it's vintage ware I saved from being e waste Me after re capping my second hand motherboard for the 2nd time still using a PS 2 ball mouse here LOL
I'm gonna be honest I responded to your post when I was distracted and think I missed your point yes totally agreed that the actual building and modding of PCs is a hobby in and of itself and then you get to use it to play games and render 3d models and train neural networks and upvote cat pictures
I mean dude have you seen what s been going on in the world People are literally peasants again lmao
Companies don't care about anyone criticizing their pricing when there are many others buying their totally overpriced stuff because they can
Oh piss off with your holier than thou attitude There are legitimate economic and energy crises going on in the world and paired with the absolute stagnation of wages millions of people are struggling where they weren't before It isn't because they're whining and complaining the economic system is just fucking them completely regardless of how hard they work
True It is more annoying to see the people complain about the outrageous prices yet they go out and buy the worst bang for buck cards out there which is usually the top 2 3 Nvidia cards Just because the performance may be the best doesn't mean it is worth it The only way it will change is if people quit buying the damn things I did get a RX6800XT but I waited until after the prices were dropping and at the time I bought it it made no sense to get the 6800 non XT which was my original plan so I just did it But I was in at 875 not the 1300 1500 kind of prices they had been going for just a month or 2 earlier Also I do my shopping around as I like to have nice stuff but get a deal So open box X570 Asus Tuf from Newegg ram on sale etc I made a list on PCPartPicker and watched for price drops and whatnot and bought parts as they were on some kind of a deal It took about 2 months to buy the core components but I saved a few hundred dollars And then I waited for well over a year to buy the GPU and struggled along with my R9 290 and eventually a used RX480 when driver support ruined that in the middle of the scalpocalypse TLDR you can have nice things on a budget if you plan it out and have patience But don't complain about the pricing and throw money at them anyway If people don't pay it the price will come down
Would you like to know more
Nah cool it enough and you will hit PBO or FIT limits before 95C
I did see a video on how the increased power draw affects the internal structures of the transistors on the chip So the higher the power draw more is the wear and tear on the chip Although how much power and how long this needs I don't know
That s absolutely wild
Try SYY 157
gc extreme mastergel maker tf x
The aluminum one is already mixed It uses the same copper nickel plated base as the full copper one Maybe there is another factor to consider or the dissipation coeficient doesn't matter much like the thermal paste example above
Bruh AMD isn't going to sell delidded CPUs The other option is a thinner IHS which has like 5C temps but doesn't work with a lot more coolers
you need to learn what heat flow is What I mean is that the temp on the die is not a function of heat generated or likely even the temperature of the parts being used the actual places where heat is produced but rather a function of how quickly that heat is being removed Having the CPU cooler doesn't mean its generating less heat If the CPU can operate the same at 90C as it can at 70C you'll see zero performance difference Also keep in mind that in terms of actual physical differences due to temp you need to put everything in kelvin So you're talking 343K vs 363K Which is what like a 5 difference Any real world effect would be smaller than that
My printer is currently on pause but it'll get to work soon I would love to get into photography but I don't really have the money to buy a camera and fear that I wouldn't use it
still using a PS 2 ball mouse here You realize the very good quality optical USB mice are going to ewaste right now
It's amazing that PS 2 has outlasted the 1 8th inch audio jack It will definitely have a shorter lifespan in total but I just checked my mobo right next to the USB C is a ps 2 This article is funny shows the danger of filtering forward slash from your AI content generator's feed stock
Yea I look forward to the build rebuild much more than the games though I am a gamer and a cat upvoter If someone wants to troll me about wasted money I have a spare bedroom full of content for them to use I probably have 3 cpu coolers 5 radiators 300 in fittings everything from cases to 4 different thermal pastes various waterblocks etc I'm also into building speaker crossovers and home theater amps The amount of time that I've spent tearing my speakers apart to upgrade internal 'm sure some would say isn't worth the output Everyone must decide for themselves what is actually a waste of money If a hobby brings you peace and you aren't hurting others wellbeing with your financial decisions then i believe that no one should be telling us what we should be doing Some people on reddit are naive enough to believe that their experiences have made them qualified to judge things that are based on metrics they likely aren't even capable of considering
People are literally peasants again lmao Some are peasants most of the rest of us are human resources where there may be a difference in the standard of living but conceptually aren't that far apart
Well I would say that despite the economic conditions many people in the middle class are unaffected and people who already had money are making making more money Sadly as is usually the case the poor are getting poorer but they are not generally the target market of new high end GPU releases
Why should people not buy what makes them happy when they can afford the extra 20 30 price rise in MSRP Regardless of what you think about whether they listen to criticism or not the companies are the ones raising the prices
Oh piss off with your holier than thou attitude Another ignorant post from someone who clearly can't read and understand basic context I can only repeat that I am not complaining about people complaining about the economy I am referring only to Redditors who are actively criticizing others for their purchasing choices So yeah but no you can piss off with your misguided holier than thou attitude
The 4090 is not terrible bang for buck if you want extreme performance and the independent reviews are confirming that It's much better BBB than the 3090 was
There are always lots of factors involved fin density for example
From the timestamp t 157 The delidding process should be the same as pretty much all the other delidders we've made so far just using shear force from the side and metal fatigue Der8auers solution moves the IHS back and forth to break the glue bond and crack the solder hence the metal fatigue comment You can buy delidding tools for 3000 and 5000 series that work on the same principle instead of using heat like OP did but because there's more glue surface area it has to be pre cut Here's a 3950x being delidded the same way as der8auer is doing the 7950x v qu839b VleE and the CPU shares identical mechanical construction with ryzen 5000 so is also possible on a 5950x EDIT And here's a 5900x delid in German v yj WQD1HkoA using heat like OP did When people talk about CPUs being soldered it's always been in the context of thermal paste vs solder connecting the die s to the IHS The edges have always been silicone glue
If the CPU can operate the same at 90C as it can at 70C you'll see zero performance difference Meanwhile the rest of us live in the real world where modern CPUs that are thermal throttling at heat limit perform less well than better cooled versions of themselves where they can hit their power limit without running into their thermal limit first
Whatever you say but going back to the original question Would it make sense for the CPU manufacturers to make a more cooling friendly lid If i'm buying an expensive cpu like a 7900x I can afford a decent and efficient new cooler compatible with my new expensive toy Why go for compatibility when you can have better performance Look at threadripper Its different in so many ways yet they released it the way it is Why go for compatibility when you can have more efficiency and performance with a 7900x
The issue is boosting Yes a cpu will compute the same at 90c as 70c if that is the max temp they will get to and stay at that But in the case of boosting that 90c cpu will jump significantly higher and then throttle to keep temperatures down The 70c cpu will have an immensely higher threshold to boost way beyond what the 90c cpu can do This is why people use curve optimizer to undervolt their cpu so it runs cooler and therefore performs better
Lol so my way of getting into a hobby is to jump in head first and buy the expensive stuff and then use the price I paid to force myself to use it It s only bitten me a couple of times
You realize the very good quality optical USB mice are going to ewaste right now My younger brother actually gave me two non working PS 2 optical and minor cable soldering on one Both are too sensitive jerky to my taste Granted they are pure chinesium I guess it's a matter of taste at this point Good thing I have another two ball mouse as spares Both of them have dual scroll wheels horizontal vs vertical scrolling Might end up reusing the optical mice on some DIY electronics project though D
Ugh I m tired of poor people who are getting poorer complaining about economic conditions in my space maybe they should be poor in some other subreddit
not trying to argue this honestly But it is usually the 60 70 series Nvidia cards and AMD equivalent that have the best bang for buck offering it is not the level of performance of the 4090 or any 90 90ti cards i am questioning It is the ROI and performance level for what you pay additionally Now look at any reputable reviewer online for the last 3 or so generations of cards on both sides almost across the board the recommended card is in the middle of the stack not the top and not the bottom Extreme performance comes at a premium cost and budget cards are usually bad performance per dollar and are really only good for a monitor output that doesn't matter for anything but seeing computer output workstation server replacing dead onboard graphics etc There is a reason that the 1060 and 1660 are so popular It is because they are the solid middleweight performers They will do what most people NEED for 1080p gaming on most titles It is the middle of the stack that offers the best bang for the buck now there are exceptions but i hope that the 4090 isn't setting the new bar for price to performance if so the average gamer is actually going to be priced out of the game i assume that the shift of all of this to 1440p gaming will happen very soon but almost any midlevel card in the last generation will do 1440p I was playing games on my r9 290 and RX480 in 1440p obviously not as well as newer or more powerful but the point is people will move to 1440p as it gets easier and cheaper to do with midweight cards i expect a large jump in adoption rates of 1440p displays with this gen of GPUs as trends are showing it has started to happen I remember playing games at 800x600 and 1280x1024 back in the
As I said same design Same fin size Same number of fins Same copper heatpipes Maybe your statement of AL having better dissipation is not true It would make sense if heat transfer works both ways
Ryzen 7000 is deliberately intended to run at over 90 degrees we'll be fine
but it doesnt run the same at 70c it keeps boosting derbauer was able to consistently get several hundred more mhz
I don't know if it's true but others have said that the 3D cache raises the thickness of the whole thing so you'd end up with two sized AM5 parts AM5 3D and AM5 non3D Let me ask you a question if AMD had 2 5 performance sitting there and all they had to do was obviate all the CPU coolers from AM4 don't you think they would I do It's such a tight race with Intel there's nothing off the table Its more likely that there is just nothing to gain by whatever marginal improvement you'd get by making the lid thinner You might make it easier to break the die you might only lower temps by 5C under load which would do almost nothing for performance Sure there might be a few sitting there but I doubt it
The 70c cpu will have an immensely higher threshold to boost way beyond what the 90c cpu can do I don't agree with that The temps are being used as a proxy for issues related to voltage resistance and heat production The heat production doesn't change if you have better cooling especially when you have multiple layers involved in this case the chip itself it's silicon cover poor heat conductor and then the lid You're barely going to move the temp at the site where the heat is being produced by changing the thickness of the lid So what would likely happen is they'd have the temps be lower and then lower the temp threshold by the same amount
I always to think about doing it the same way but then I look at the price and see that i don't have the money I kinda did that once with drawing Bought XP pen deco pro for digital drawing but I just can't get myself to draw even though I love sketching all the time it feels like the results aren't there I'm curious what were the hobbies that bit you If you don't mind sharing of course
You are just confirming everything I wrote earlier
not trying to argue this honestly But it is usually the 60 70 series Nvidia cards and AMD equivalent that have the best bang for buck offering There is no 'argument' because it is not mutually exclusive that the RTX4090 cannot be a certain kind of value in its own market segment and I was of course not referring to it as the best bang for buck you injected that into the conversation
No definitely true materials science is pretty solid The ratio of copper to aluminum mating efficiency and even the specific allows can cause all sorts of differences in to the fourth power easily capable of dominating the equation And of course the thermal dissipation rate here applies to air I believe water wicks from copper better than aluminum What cooler comes in both copper and aluminum Any heat pipes present
That was my point
Yeah makes sense If the CPU can operate the same at 90C as it can at 70C you'll see zero performance difference I have my doubts about this We all know that ryzen is really sensitive to temperature and adjusts boost behavior based on temperature and power headroom 20 C would certainly have an impact in the clocks But I agree It will not make a big difference in the end Hopefully
RC car racing was probably what bit me the hardest I started off modest doing 1 10th scale electric touring cars Expensive but low running costs Then decided to get into nitro buggy racing that became fright racing and then 1 10th buggy I was pouring thousands into cars that were being unused because the next type of racing took over my focus Final straw for me that caused me to jack it all in was a race weekend I blew up an engine on day 1 practice I burned out 2 servos on day 2 and on race day my engine blew up 800 in parts on top of tyres that are 50 a set and last about 10 minutes Didn t help I don t have a competitive nature so I didn t have the drive to win Less of a hobby that I didn t do but one that hit hard I love cycling and twice I ve bought road bikes thinking I d use them That have sat around for months or years until I sold them I just prefer mountain bikes If I m not chucking myself off the side of mountains with huge jumps I m binning it around forest So road bikes are definitely on the list
That people complaining about worsening socio economic situations annoys you because it doesn t affect you I don t think you needed me to affirm that for you but you clearly don t like facing reality
while personal budgets vary and the amount people are comfortable spending for a particular thing will also vary bang for buck is not subjective it is objective and mathematical performance per dollar spent and the higher end cards have generally a much lower fps or whatever performance metric compared to the average cost I am not saying that they are not the cards to get for certain use or for certain people but it is past the point of diminishing returns excluding the RTX3000 RX6000 cards the 1660TI is the top of the stack in price to performance have not seen any charts with those cards added but i bet it changed nothing as they were not available for the longest time at MSRP look at cars you can buy a used 370Z and put a turbo kit on it and go really fast or you can buy a BMW 335I and tune it and also be really fast but if you want to drive faster y0ou buy a ferrari lamborghini porsche etc they are not necessarily better cars but they look cool and go very fast with no extra effort but you are paying 30 50k for those cheaper options and 150k for the higher end ones price to performance the 370Z with turbos is the best bet but the experience overall will be better and your friends will be much more envious of a Lambo Huracan in your
Thermalright axp 90R Al E6 A0 87 E5 87 86 E7 89 88 and Cu e7 ba af e9 93 9c e7 89 88 Yes I'm aware there are a ton of axp 90 versions and I have the ones linked In case you don't trust my testing here another redditor with similar results Anyhow it's not the first CU vs Al discussion And from what I read I'll continue to believe that CU is better at convection on an air cooled heatsink Sorry if I don't engage you further as I just got a life time headache with thermodynamics
Wow RC cars look so awesome I even own some cheap ones but never used them since I've got them as a gift and was never interested I also love cycling since my parents are sporty our whole family has mountain bikes and we go cycling multiple times a year not counting just going for a ride near our town Also tried a few Singletracks and while the rest of my family liked it I loved it Hopefully in the near future I'll be able to go again Thanks for sharing
I think you are just too triggered by your social justice warrior mode to read the thread properly and think rationally because I very specifically addressed in an earlier post above that I am talking ONLY about people criticizing others for their purchases or for seeming rich Of course people can and should complain about worsening economic conditions
while personal budgets vary and the amount people are comfortable spending for a particular thing will also vary bang for buck is not subjective it is objective and mathematical You are objectively not fully correct in your argument because the definition of value is definitely in part subjective to the buyer If you want extreme performance to power the most demanding games at 4k or in VR for the next 2 years then the RTX4090 will be good value to many people There is simply nothing that can touch it and it is far better bang for buck than the RTX3090 was on release That's a fact
Thanks I may buy both versions you have I would be really curious to see and profile the thermal properties If that's just pressure fit then the copper to copper mating will be far superior to the aluminum to copper mating which would explain a lot
Happy to share RC cars are cool Even cheap ones Dig them out and have a bash you ll love it I will give some old fart 33 wisdom on mountain bikes stay humble Don t listen to the hype when you re getting into it You don t need a carbon frame you don t need full suspension and you don t need the best components I fell into that trap and can t get out of it I ve had more fun on lower tier bikes than I do my top end Mainly because I m scared to break them Funny story deep on a pc hard drive somewhere is footage of me breaking my back on a downhill run while I was on the floor in agony all you hear me saying over and over is my bike ok IS MY BIKE OK Lol priorities aye Nothing serious happened to me Well I had a part of my spine snap off and a big crack in a vertebrae but no surgery and nothing permanent It was high up on my back so didn t effect mobility and I was walking within hours on a crap load of pain killers might I add Basically don t hit trees at like 35mph Oh and my bike was fine lol
I really like this it looks like a cozy fireplace Looks hot runs cool I hope When you were choosing motherboard and RAM for this did you go based on QVL or did you just wing it I am picking parts right now for a 7800X3D build if I can even get one and the QVL seems lacking on a lot of motherboards
We need more wooden cases
Kinda looks like an oven from the side Is it just me
I kept thinking how overrated this case was
r pcporn
The Alpenf hn logo really brings a super cool 1970's vibe that looks fantastic with the log cabin fire place feel of the build Also the RGB cables look really slick in this build Fantastic work
You mean you can make your cables glow with AMD too Damn I bought NVidia just for that
nice one
Oh and one more question Did you get a sound card specifically because most mobos do not have optical audio anymore Or is the sound quality that much better
Pictures taken with a thermal camera Nice build and enjoy the beast
Ohhh that AIO is pure love D Silent as snow perfect for audiophiles lol
This is stunning I was kind of expecting to see a couple of valves
Looks industrial
'Woodsman' model I see
Love my 7900 XTX Nitro Hope you're loving yours just as much
That front looks so good and tge warm lighting really adds to it
Beautiful I've been drooling over the North since I first saw it Really gorgeous build
Fast and classy Love it
This case is just sublime I love it Your build is superb Definitely going to be next case Currently have a Nr200p with 4080 due to my small office I love how the orange RGB lighting compliments the case so well
Godiwantthatcase
ooh alpenfohn I see you sir are a connoisseur
I built a similar pc in white I'm really liking the mesh side panel and glad I went for it instead of tempered glass I'm REALLY considering cutting out the T shaped supports in the side panel with an angle grinder and hoping the side panel is still strong enough to not warp
one of the best looking rigs I have seen in a while
I think my next build is gonna be in a case like this and I will give it pulsating orange LEDs so it looks like one of those wooden box looking space heaters or a fireplace
that build is so fucking beautiful lol holy shit work of art
Hey Great job by the way man looks great I have got most of my parts together but couldn t figure out if those Lian Li Strimer s were worth it but now that I see this it looks great Did you get just the one pack or how does it work as they are expensive Did you get x3 v8 pin and x1 24 pin
Bro you ve inspired me This is how I want my build to look Love the wood grilles
I love that everyone's rediscovering the Joy that is warm deep orange lighting in a black or grey PC case I use orange lighting because it's easy on the eyes at night and still visible during the day
I love this look Like a really cool heater probably puts out enough heat too lol
That would be sooooooooo scary to have in my apartment I'd be so worried it would catch on fire lol
I have never seen a rig more in need of a tempered glass side panel Inside and the front look amazing
The gpu takes the cake nice build my guy
One of the few cool build posts here
I like
It looks like a cross between a vintage speaker box from the 70 s and something from the Dead Space games and I love it
Yeah im stealing this build thanks
firefirefire
Mate this is stunning Ngl I'm a little tempted to pension off my trusty old Antec P193 after seeing this especially with the orange lighting Ticks all my aesthetic boxes OK hand medium light skin tone
It s giving FDR fireside chats
am i the only one
Cool it's like microwave on steroid
Stellar build
It looks like a fucking oven hob microwave and radiator at the same time sick
F yes the nitro is really really really good and imho the best 7900XTX you can buy I also like the build and the vibe it brings nice
Damn that's clean
Nice space heater
Take a bow my man
First thought that came to mine was molten lava
This is so well done Absolutely beautiful
Nice build gif emote free emotes pack give upvote How your mobo chipset temp mine is around 87 95C Is mine too hot
Thats a table lamp clearly
Nice I have the Sapphire Nitro 7900XTX as well in a Fractal Design Meshify 2 XL case Fractal fam
It looks fire ngl
YOOO that looks insane Love the wood front and that orange lighting smiling face with sunglassesOK hand
Beautiful raising hands
I love it This looks absolutely perfect Just a question but how much did this build approx cost
Looks like its on fire but im shure its chill with that liquid refrigeration
Unreal case I'm getting it now lol
low key love that fractal case Having actual wood on the front is such a weird flex but I love it Makes my Meshify 2 look so lame D
I would not have put that much lighting inside if I got the mesh panel version
gif giphy yhLV2DGTLDRCw
Looks nice but my OCD gives me anxiety from those GPU cables and AIO pipes D
How many bluescreens per day
ruined it with those dumbass cables
That is a horrid way to set up your aio
I want to know the FPS in CS GO face with tears of joy
May I know your cpu temp when idle Just curious because I have the same cpu and i am not liking the idle temp
Beautiful
Looks great except in the last two images it looks a bit like a microwave lol
It's glowing hot fix your temps bruuhh
im i seeing things are your psu cables glowing if so were do i get those are they custom if so how an were do i get them
It's cool Looks like a space heater lol
Can I have it face holding back tears
This is by far the sexiest minimalist case I've seen on this sub EDIT I retract that purely due to the panel If that was a glass panel it would br a winner
Are you getting the results out of the X3D that you wanted Wavering on it myself
what does the front of the case look like with the 3 fans
What a classy build flushed face Would be nicer with a glass panel instead since the interior looks superb
what cable extensions are those
Love it How was that case to build in I've been looking at a fractal torrent compact but the fact that it's a pain to cable manage has turned me off a bit
Very steampunk
Also got this CPU In case you haven t thought about it already in order to get proper performance the new 3d cpus need a fresh bios update Xbox game app update or game bar or something can t remember the name Either way it s to help make sure you re using the cores with extended cache when gaming updated chipset drivers If interested let me know and I ll source the proper details
Do you feel the quality of the Fractal North is worth the price I have been really wanting to buy this case but I already have the Fractal Torrent and the quality is top notch and I read that the North is an 80 case with nice aesthetics priced at 120 or 150 depending where you buy it Did you feel like it was flimsy to build in or anything And how s the airflow I also have a 7900XTX but mine is the Taichi model and the card runs HOT I also have a 3090 so I swap GPUs fairly often just to play around with each But point is I generate a lot of heat and unsure if the North can handle it like the Torrent
You make me regret buying what I bought Awesome rig tho
I have seen this case before and damn the wood on the front is nice
Nice bruh
oo it is beautiful
What kind of monitors do you use this with for gaming
Amazing build but I think it would look much better with a TG side panel
This thing looks Evil Mean Ominous I love it
Damn I don't usually comment on rig pictures but this one is slick What is the case Cables
The warm lighting is incredible the ram and gpu choice match the build so well too What color code is this warm white color
Nice
That s fucking amazing One thing tho just get a little black doohickey to keep the GPU from sagging I only noticed because it being slightly off triggered my OCD grinning face with sweat otherwise that shit is absolutely gorgeous
No lie that s probably the most beautiful computer I ve ever seen Very nice job
What are those cables
Very nice build I just love the combo with the case and ProArt motherboard Good fit How do you like the XTX Nitro How are the temps on it Any noticeable coilwhine
How did you do that with your card I have the same card and love orange Can i make my 670ehero have the same color
Where'd you get those cables
Nice But now you can't tell if the PC is on fire or just running
What a stylish build love it Hoping to build a 7900X3D 7900XTX system myself seems to be the right thing to do
That looks SO good
AMD probably feels how it looks lol
Man I wish I had cables like those for my pc
Love that case
Beautiful I wish I had something like this
Microwave mesh
Very nice build looks like it would keep you warm during cold gaming nights fire
What fans are those
Looks cozy and slick
Fuck I love this color It reminds me of the glow from an old tube amp
Love the way the orange fan lights look behind the front wood slat cover on the last picture
I didn't knew you could put led on CABLES man we can't live without lights in our cases
The north looks so nice
It feels like a vintage radio with tubes glowing in side I love it Truly beautiful build
We need an ITX variant of this case for sff
I see this case every day now and am still not sick of it Really good on Fractal for making something a little more different Crazy how little they changed but it looks so nice Also dig the build OP Reminds me of a fireplace
That GPU looks very nice
Very nice
Rgb cables Thats damn cool The orange looks so damn good too
Absolutely love this case
RGB color code
Monster PC and it looks fantastic
Very retro I like it
How is this xcx working for you Performance temps noise
Love the northern case
these LEDs are probably hotter than GPU
Damn thing looks like a reactor out of a dystopian film
its so sexy damn
Nice What is the RGB for that color
Nice has a classic tube amp look
Microwave oven
It looks cozy I would play something like stardew valley or outer wilds
Really nice setup Can't you mount the AIO upside down Pipes should be a the
My brother in christ you ARE the fireplace
Bro doesn't have water cooling He has lava cooling
What a fantastic build
Lol looks like an oven I hope it cooler than it looksthumbs up
Lord have mercy I'm finna buss
Amazing rig but I have to say in the last picture it looks like a radiator
What wires you use to go into graphics card Those things look sick
Awesome rig plese use commas I can't figure out where the name of one stops and next starts
Hey man you've inspired me to go for this case Love the wood Was wondering if you wouldn't mind clarifying The Fractal North website says Room for a GPU up to 355 mm with front fans installed or up to 300 mm with a front radiator So given you GPU is 325mm how did you fit a 360 AIO in the front
mans got the lava powered gpu lol
I have always hated lights in rigs In most cases very tacky this is nice Very nice
Nice
Looking to buy a 7900 XTX Vapor x 7800x3d Nice setup Love the RGB on the GPU
What are these lit cables
This is beautiful I just ordered all my parts for my new build and was looking at this case for hours and hours trying to see if everything would fit But the card I got Aorus 7900xtx was too big to fit in the case with the radiator and fans on the front How long is the Nitro card Is it tight in there
Looks like molten lava I love it
Definetly looked for AM5 compatible ram with EXPO Did not check the QVL list since the Ram I choose is a very very popular one there were alot of working examples and yeah it really does feel like a fireplace temps are usually around 60 both GPU and CPU under full load which is really nice
That orange light reminds me of Nixie tubes i like it
GSkill has some 6000 cl30 with EXPO Works out of the box no fiddling around Some other brands have some with the same specs so I guess it's the same chips Board wise I went with the NZXT board since most good looking boards were expensive anyway So I went with 650E directly Planted a 7700 non X Hope to switch to the final AM5 CPU when the socket's lifetime ends
I recently winged it on ram using 4 dimm's ddr4 though and it worked out Check your mobo's max supported ram speed and go with 2 dimm's 2xYGB and you should be fine 2 ram sticks handle higher MHZ easier than 4 ram sticks matching of course and I think dual channel is the way to go
QVL I'm also trying to build a 7800x3d computer for when it comes out Can you look over my build I posted but didn't get any comments
I just built a similar system but i went more budget on the case and opted for 32gig ram rather than 64 I have the RGB set to the complete opposite of this a nice cool blue ice to match the lighting on my non rgb gpu AMD 7950X 32gb Patriot Viper 6000mhz Gigabyte Gaming AX X Powercolour HellHound 7900xtx MSI MagCore Liquid Cooler LianLi Lancool 215 It's a beast but I've been having some teething problems The first boot of the day takes around 15 20 mins to post then it's fine for the rest of the day until it's been shut down for the night That and figuring out how to get the RGB connected better for more custom lighting The RBG software shows 4 RGB Zones RAM but I only see one 3 prong RGB header and not sure if I can plug into the others I currently have all the Motherboard and case RGB plugged into an RGB controller that then takes input from that single 3 prong RGB header
I 100 agree
Or literally anything that isn't the stupid gamer aesthetic
It shouldn't become some gimmick but I can definitely see why this case became so popular it's very well executed and the wood nicely accentuates the rest without becoming too dominant
Get woodgrain vinyl wrap like LGR lol
definetly not it does have that cozy fireplace feeling haha
glad to have changed your mind because that case is simply amazing you could definetly feel a difference how easy it was to assemble compared to other cheaper cases
Beware as beautiful as it is the reviews say the build quality is lacking for the price it commands
what is it
Really I'm literally so sick of it It's not that cool tbh At this point i just gloss over every single build inside of one
r battlestations
Many people forget there is five major cooling companies situated in Germany Austria Only think of Noctua and Be Quiet While there is Alphacool Watercool and Alpenf hn as well And their stuff is just top notch standard and quality
While it is true that AMD uses negatively polarized inverse electricity compared to the normal electricity that NVIDIA uses you can still find RGB cables that support that kind of electricity They might be a couple of bucks more expensive though
mainly because I have 600 Ohm headphones the sound quality of this mobo is actually pretty decent
Thinking of buying the 280 thinking face
I do wish it would let me do 2 tone on the lightbar though
thank you so much
Best fans and AIO hand down D
yep X3 8 and x1 24 and yes they are pretty expensive for some rgb
i absolutely love it it feels like a warm fireplace next to me
They said in another comment they ordered the TG panel and got sent the mesh one by mistake but didn't exchange it because it would take too long to get a new case shipped with TG At some point Fractal will likely offer the side panels as accessories similar to some of their other cases but I'm guessing since this case is getting sold as fast as they are available they just don't have the extra panels yet
thank you for the award 3
sounds pretty hot might need to get a bit better airflow trough your case
around 4k
funny story the build was planned with TG panel shop send the wrong case didn't want to send back because the TG version wouldn't be in stock before June so I just went with it and with the stuff I already had planned anyways I am still very happy how it turned out the mesh looks less see trough than it actually is in real life
As an owner of the Gletscherwasser AIO I can tell you one thing Unless you cut these pipes nothing will break shit is the most sturdy rubber piping I have seen in a while Fresh OOTB they are bit unflexible but after a few days they get a bit more flexible Only issue You can literally not hear the pump when I installed mine I needed a metal road to notice the vibrations of it cuz it made no noise whatsoever xD
why would he have bluescreens wont these components work out the box
didn't check csgo but in dota 2 I had around 500
around 40 to 45
don't
just a little over 60 for cpu and GPU under full load but yeah it does look like a campfire
those are Lian Li Strimer Plus V2 they are extenders are can be bought in quite alot of online Shops not the cheapest option for some flashy lights tho
if you pay for everything I can build you a twin pc face with tears of joy
for now definetly yes I wanted the 7950x3d but it's nowhere in stock
I'll send a picture in a bit
I wanted glass but after getting the wrong case delivered I didn't want to wait another 2 3 month to assemble
lian li strimer plus v2
I actually enjoyed building in it quite alot it was a tight fit but worked fine cable management is almost a pain especially with smaller cases
don't worry this is a complete fresh build with everything up to date and game bar running
I absolutely fell in love with the quality of the case you do have to check if the taichi xtx actually fits in especially with a radiator in front my xtx nitro runs cyberpunk on ultra at 68C
I got Fractal North and while its not 'big' inside it def dosent feel cheap and both from my experience and Gamers Nexus benchmarks i got the mesh one temps are perfectly fine It fine to build in nothing extremely good or bad about it Looks amazing and theres 0 cheap feeling about it I got totally different system 13600k 4080 but i had 5800x3d before the upgrade due to not being a very patient person and that was running fine in there too CPU is idling at 30 degrees now gpu at 35 In Cinebench CPU peaks at 75 with 26k score oc pcores to 5 5ghz e cores to 4 3 ghz undervolted In gaming both cpu and gpu stay below 60 degrees Using ak620 air cooler added 2 exhaust fans to the case 120mm in the back and 140mm in the back top Kept default 2x140mm in the front According to benchmark from Gamers Nexus the case is between Fractal Torrent and Meshify being in his torture test at 45 degrees while Torrent is at 40 degrees and Meshify is at 50 Friend bought the case too and is extremely happy too I personally went with Mesh version as that the one i wanted and im running 0 rbg maybe TG version will be a little hotter
right now I have a BenQ Zowie XL2411P but I want to upgrade to the Qled from alienware because otherwise this build is wasted potential
I agree
fractal North Lian Li Strimer Plus V2
haha there's already an anti sag Bar installed it's still sagging a little just a little less
thank you

reddit fucked it up it was listed underneath eachother
Um actually swapping the 7900x3d for a 7950x3d
320 pretty tight
What is the actual color code for the lights Or was this a preset golden glow option
Oh yeah G Skill 6000mhz cl30 seems like the way to go for AM5 at least The QVL on the G Skill site for the RAM to check the compatible motherboards seems better then checking vice versa
Yeah I feel like for my last build with DDR4 memory this was the case I don't remember there being a QVL I just found ram that matched the speed the mobo was able to do and bought it
Qualified Vendor List Basically you can check the motherboard's support page and it will show you a list of RAM that they have tested with and had it work at the overclocked speeds and generally CPUs and M 2 storage You can also check the RAM's support page for the which mobos they have tested with From my research it seems that a lot of AM5 motherboard QVL pages have slim pickings when it comes to what RAM has been checked I have switched over to just looking at the RAM's QVL to see what mobos are compatible In the case of your parts list I would look up the RAM SKU on pc parts picker and find the G Skill page for it I would check that QVL to see that the mobo you want is on there In this case the RAM you have picked on pc parts picker is the Intel XMP version so it shows mobos for the latest Intel socket not AM5 It might still work but G Skill hasn't check it specifically The other option is to go to the mobo's QVL support memsup support memsup And then search for the memory by the SKU in question In this case the RAM sku shows up in the list meaning Gigabyte tested with this RAM and it worked so you should probably be solid
Fractal has been making great non gamer cases for ages now I've been using the Define S since 2015 There are plenty of options from other brands too
which aspect of the case is gamer though the window without the gamer enthusiasm pc's would be built into monitors p edit I guess you'd have to make your own if people ask for input and you just downvote
Yes and no I think gamer aesthetic should change Less all blinky flash RGB builds more pick a color scheme and stick with it Be it all pastel vaporwave or fireplace less pachinko game machine
What nah no wrap to imitate wood I want REAL wood smh
I have used fractal design for ten years Best cases imo
Never heard that what reviews
Fractal design north
It's one of the few cases that doesn't look like it was designed by a 15 year old
yes
Also Arctic
While I would love to claim Noctua's fame for ourselves they are an Austrian company The rest is accurate as far as I know
I have an Alpenf hn Black Ridge in my SFF build Lovely little thing I am not familiar with Watercool but I've always been air cooling my builds Noctua is Austrian however
Wouldn't an external USB DAC have been better for this kind of impedance I went away from a soundcard because I got fan statics on my Yamaha monitors with the DAC outside no such issues
I am trying to decide between the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Pro AX or the Aorus Elite AX There is a 50 to 80 GBP price difference depending on the retailer and the only real reason for going for the more expensive Pro would be for the optical audio port Do you think that is worth it compared to using an analog 3 5mm cable Or would the cheaper board plus a soundcard be better
Resistance ohms of a headphone actually has nothing to do with how hard it is to drive just a very common misconception Sensitivity is the operative measurement And a low resistance headphone with low sensitivity is the hardest to drive combination because it requires much more power
Would do it D
I game at 4k although I do use FSR quality a lot
You the best thank you Easy to configure color and the like
Hehe I can imagine My Torrent's front panel softly glows like halogen bar heater it's so inviting
Thanks for letting me know makes sense That's a bummer It's just a shame to cover up that beauty At least 's in there
I have 3 push front fan and 1 rear pull I think that my mobo have problem
Aight well that might be a bit much for me Absolutely stunning though
Fractal should give both panels like Cooler Master does with the NR200P
Contact Fractal about it maybe they send you a TG panel for free or cheaply Should also be available as replacement part I really like the looks of your build but I got the white TG version and conparing yours to mine I wouldn't go mesh on it Edit which speed is your Trident Z Neo I have the 6000CL30 kit and running into CPU error when running it at 6000 and cold booting Havent tried anything aside from EXPO in terms of getting it stable Reducing IF to 1933 fixes it though
Thanks for posting these pictures I had been planning on getting the North with the mesh panel for thermals but after seeing this I think I definitely want a TG panel now My current system is in a Define 7 so I don't necessarily need a new case right away I can wait until the North I want is available Probably not going to build the new system for another month or so as I'm waiting for the 7800X3D to come out and get reviewed before I decide what I'm getting for the next one
Nice
I get similar Temps idle on my 7700x with peerless assassin When running cinebench it goes straight to 95 unless I'm undervolted
Mine is like 45 50 I guess it is still ok
armoury Crate I'm sorry
Bullshit it's glowing red
Alright We have a deal I'll move to the states in two years I'll come and find you and learn how to build D
awesome ty
Well I was thinking about going for the compact because it's cheaper and I don't think I'd use all the available space in the full size Depending on what the cable management situation is in the full size I may just go for the regular torrent
Right on Yea the Taichi card is huge I really like it tho They should ve launched this level of performance LAST Gen then they d be competing even with NVIDIA because this 7900XTX is almost even with my 3090 in every way and the Adrenaline software is BETTER than NVIDIAs offering But back to the case thing I run my Taichi card in the torrent system 12700K sometimes other times I run it in my 5800X3D system which is in a Lian Li 011 Air Mini That case actually keeps this card pretty cool too Don t NEED the Fractal North but I kinda wanted to get it and sell the 011 Idk prly just keep it since the North is OOS anyway
Feels wrong getting em for my all corsair build but idk if there are corsair branded rgb cables lol
Do you recommand based on your experience with it It is the most expensive one out there
The GPU and CPU series matchup had a funny thing going on shame you had to change it haha
Ah ya a bit smaller than the card I ordered 335mm I spent a lot of time trying to see if it would work That is a beautiful build thumbs up light skin tone
Wondering too
I winged it and it is actually different codes for cable ram fans GPU I just used the dial untill I liked R 213 G 66 B 10 then for GPU it's FF 51 00 didnt check for cables but can do tomoorw
I got the Define 7 xl for this reason even got the windowless version Case I had before was so damn cramped there was barely any airflow with the Define 7 xl even with a 3090 in there I could use it as a spare room face with tears of joy
Why would anybody sell a pc in a monitor for 3000 when then can just sell the monitor to vastly more people and for cheaper
I am talking about this specific case and what the reviewers had to say Not their general reputation over 10 years
Don t remember exactly which ones but it was the major YT channels that covered it when it first came out
Correct It looks like it was designed by and for every single one of the most basic 22 year old white men ever It should come free with an Eames chair and whiskey stones It's just like very shallow and trite in it's design language It's really not much more mature than a basic mesh flow case
Impedance is irrelevant to the need for an amp
External dac amp would be a better choice imo
usually external is better but I didn't want so much stuff around my rig so I decided to go with a soundcard don't have any Fan static
uhm yeah except it would be really quiet if I just plug it into a normal headphone jack
of you build in the control unit and hook it up to a USB port then yes but you do need the lian li rgb Software
well it's not as bad as in the pictures and also I'll try to get a panel later on the road
it might have hard to say I am not the most technical able person
they are not yet available as replacements
the setups was a bit of a troubleshooting process but nothing that reddit and other platforms can't fix
Im in Germany haha
don't think there are corsair rgb cables
for now 100
I must say it did kinda like the match as well but I got a 7950x3d laying here ready to go and Amazon already said they take the 7900x3d without any problems even if it was already in use etc
answered above
OHHHHH Ty wonderful random person on internet with a gorgeous PC I appreciate you Please let me know re others I want to play with my parts when all of them come to get similar look
Would be fun to let the gpu pcie cables glow up when the gpu is under load as if these cables rut hot and give light due to too much current
IDK but it works great for Apple
Ive only ready good reviews from both the most trusted swedish site and actual customers
quality seems to be really really good can't complain
I basically plowed through all of them that released within the first week and a half and none of them spoke ill of it other than the side bracket being useless
lolwut almost every big YT channel that review it pretty much loved it even Steve from GN what are you talking about
I'd rather take that than a rgb spaceship Tired of having a black box or glowing ufo standing around I will order the white one with oak on the side then put it on a oak shelf and put an extra custom made panel on the side to almost entirely hide it from sight Invisible tech is best tech
My electrotechnical knowledge about oscillating circuits says otherwise but my apprenticeship is 20 years back
Second external dac amp combo Might be slightly more expensive than 80gbp but much better than any integrated option Look at topping dx1 fiio k3 or best value option but most money on the entry level the topping dx3 pro plus
Aye I have the same sound card and I don't experience any fan static either It's a solid sound card especially for price point
You're still not understanding but you dont seem to care that you dont know so I wont try to help
It does look better at 4k It's not perfect but it makes games feel snappier There's some games that have a bad implementation tho RE4 is a good example
Hey all that matters is that you like it and it's running well You did such a great job on this build and that will be the cherry on top when you get the glass panel Could also think about some sort of clear custom panel if ya like projects
Oh damn it
Keinen problem Meine mutter st in Deutschland Ich brauhe nur Euro
Yeah good for you I still gotta wait to get the money in a few months to build my setup
I tried it and these color codes look more orange to me in person vs the pictures kinda looks like a warm white light bulb color either way this is probably the nicest build ive ever laid my eyes on I hope its treating you well That 7900 XTX Nitro just looks incredible with your build
This is one of those things that only Apple can do for any other manufacturer to do would be stupid especially if they were just a display manufacturer and suddenly you have to charge a lot more for your displays and people won t ever buy it unless they upgrade their entire computer
I m not knocking it Just saying beware man shrugging
Steve actually mentioned how thin and flimsy the chassis is and how it depends on the gpu for rigidity
There are plenty of good cool looking cases you just don't want to pay for them I'd argue this shit sticks out like a sore thumb tbh You yourself described extensive modification to get it to blend You literally have to plan your entire room around this for it to look good and cohesive cause it's just so fucking garish But yeah rgb spaceship sucks Imo nothing wrong with a black box itx build with zero lights
I second the dx3 pro plus It's sitting on my desk after all
well I was looking for a soundcard that is a good impedance match for 600 Ohm the AE 5 manages that the only reason is that I did not want to have an extra amplifier outside of my case around my desk usually the average Mainboard does not have a high enough impedance source
Do you know of some other nicer looking cases with wood details or something I don't want a black box it wont fit the room my workstation sits in Also how do you know I don't want to pay for them I just spent closer to 5k on my build plus additional cash on more NAS storage so
Like I keep telling you impedance does not make a headphone hard to drive or need a soundcard Its fine that you chose a soundcard but impedance of headphones wasn't the reason you needed more power
I mean why do you want wood details It's just such a basic bitch thing to do I don't think it's a good idea and implemented quite lazily in the North's case as well Lazer 3D has some that are more elegant but suffer from the same basic fundamental design flaw that is wood accents are simply cheesy as fuck on a computer case and really very specifically target white dudes I'd like to see an actually beautifully made all wood case or a billet milled metal case far more than these glued on sticks
lmao how the fuck does WOOD specifically target white dudes Even if it does what's the problem with that Fractal is Swedish ffs I think you have some personal racial issues to figure out
I mean why do you want wood details Calling a material preference basic bitch seems pretty shallow What is better in your opinion More plastic lol I mean why do you want wood details I live in a forest my living room has a lot of oak my family works with lumber and we do a lot of woodworking for various details in our houses as a result so quit it Some people just like wood over plastic dude Lazer 3D This is not a replacement they make m itx shit How do you propose I fit my workstation build into that Furthermore you first said that I was just too cheap to get a quality case and this is what you send me A cheaper option I'd like to see an actually beautifully made all wood case or a billet milled metal case far more than these glued on sticks I too would prefer a better made one but since there are none and this one actually performs quite well then I will take it
I think that's a very strange comment as well
Unfinished wood next to black metal is the most cliche white man design trope ever Literally every tech bro ever has bought an Eames chair exactly like that the second they graduated college I don't know anyone but white dudes who genuinely think that's a good look
How so
Not yours the guy you replied to
incompetence on many levels oooooh boy this'll be a fun one
many levels I would assume means its both on AMD and Mobo vendors design choices that together causes catastrophe
Gonna leave a bag of popcorn in the microwave ready to pop for when the video drops
What's extra spicy The team is thrilled to have a real result and successful root cause analysis that goes layers beyond it's SOC voltage because it's not that simple We appreciate your support in viewing the video when it launches because that's the real reward for our tired team Keep an eye out and share it wide s 20 x200B x200B gif giphy xTiN0CNHgoRf1Ha7CM downsized
He coming with receipts
Oh boy I'm beginning to suspect Tech Jesus isn't just a nickname anymore Looking forward to see how deep the incompetence goes
Gamersnexus is the last bastion of pc journalism
They threw some shade on people saying it's soc voltage in a follow up tweet so I wonder if it's just on the random people online or if they were throwing it on AMD too I imagine mobo vendors are gonna get it no matter what Either way I can't wait for this video It'll be great to see all the shade he's gonna throw on everyone on top of what's actually causing this weird ass malfunction
Drat I wanted the rollout to be smooth enough that 3D threadrippers would be a no brainier
Sounds like AMD is about to get nuked from orbit on this one If they shipped X3D products without proper QC then I imagine it's well deserved but I guess we'll see
Chips and beer time
Lol yes drag their asses Steve I understand the man survives on clicks but I wish he had included the most pertinent finding in this teaser so the public could start controlling the risk right away
This is the confirmation I was waiting for I hope it will push for a better resolution but part of me dreads that damage has already been done to existing products Also curious on how this impacts am5 as a whole
amd gonna announce something to look good lol
This is gonna be entertaining There's been so many catastrophic failures in hardware lately lmao This one and the faulty coolers from AMD are by far the worst since they don't have a user error element like the 40 series power cable you could just do actually everything perfectly and get shit on
Ok where is the gamers nexus video
It's hard to imagine the PC hardware world without GN the work they're capable of doing is unmatched
I made the mistake of purchasing a 7950X3D 6000MH Expo Ram and a 670E motherboard The combo was 1500 I could have spent 700 on the 13900K bundle at Microscenter and have better more stable performance I did the MSI 670E Carbon bios update My chip now runs 5 10c hotter I also have lower performance when I benchmark it I made sure to do benchmarks before the update I applied the exact same settings I feel bait and switched
gif giphy l3JDnePt8MlFnFApq Steve when he sees any product releated to tech
I'm confused about the comments here implying user error as a factor Does that mean if you only did innocent tweaks like enable expo and set PBO negative your chip should be ok
When is the video being posted on YouTube
incompetence on many levels AMD or Mobo makers
Why would they tease a video then not release it for 22 hours and counting Tease it a few hours before release or not at all it feels like yesterdays news by now for no good reason
Hopefully they go all in Reputational damage is warranted over this mess
Just yesterday I thought it was odd that GN hasn't posted a video in a while I guess I'll have something to watch while I update my BIOS
Now I wonder all those Ryzen 3000 most of them some 5000s too that I've seen dead in channels like Greg Salazar have they been immolated by motherboard vendors doing silly stuff like this
Ive written it before Someone who in their minds allowed 1 4V to be safe should be fired
So what s the context for those of us who are a little behind in the news
I have an unopened 7800X3D here so their analysis will determine if I send it back for a refund

This is just regular AMD quality control that I m accustomed to I had a 5900X system where the USB ports would randomly stop working the system would go to sleep and not wake up random BSODs even at stock settings with jdec timings etc BIOs updates would make one thing better but make another worse I think since Intel sells a lot more CPUs in like business machines office PCs etc they value stability and quality control more than AMD does When I heard about the 95C is normal guys first thing I thought about was how I m going to see people complain about their dead CPUs mobos within a couple years lol Like how early Zen 2 CPUs are starting to degrade now because AMD though it was a great idea to ram some crazy high voltage like 1 55v through them to hit the advertised single thread boost clock
Can't wait to see this one hoping to get lots of sassy remarks
Shit s about to hit the fan
Let's hope the video shows better reasoning ability than what's in the tweets Reproducing a symptom does not mean you've identified the root cause of other events that also cause that symptom You can reproduce the symptoms of an exploded Ford Pinto by throwing a Molotov cocktail at the trunk That doesn't mean you've figured out what caused the explosions and fires of other Pintos you had nothing to do with
My prediction it's a 'design flaw' with how x3d even 5800 and 7000 series work with PBO They boost unlimitedly until 95c but what if a too high SOC voltage kills disturbs one of the sensors or safeguards Mobo now doesnt know and keeps putting power into the cpu thinking its still safe to do so It's like if you would build a car that automatically accellerate until a certain speed what could possibly go wrong Wink wink
5800x3D was the right choice when I upgraded from my old 3900x a month ago
AMD just making it super easy for Intel to do nothing and still win So sad man It's been years of moving away from the amd has problems way of thinking and then there's always more
Oh boy I can't wait
Oooo this is gonna be spicy hot pepper
I hope this gets pushed out fast if they have some knowledge to share that can help the situation
I was planning a PC upgrade with 7000 series in mind but thinking of completly skipping it for next gen irrespective of this video's result and whatever fixes patches OEMs comes with I simply don't have any confidence in them anymore Seems like core parts are immature at this moment be it DDR5 RAM CPUs Boards I'm a budget oriented person hence can't take any chances but those early adopters who can afford to build upgrade rigs quite often and ready for experiments Big cheers to you guys You're the one who will help the platform mature
SoC voltage mixed with LLC is my guess possibly auto applied
I ve had nothing but problems with asus motherboards
I bet buildzoid is having a blast trying to reproduce this
Should I return my Asus tuf b650 board I'm about to build a pc with or is this fixable with bios update
This is gonna be a juicy video
I bet that bad voltage control algorithms are very much a part of these failures I noticed that once booted up properly or shutting down and booting the system back up immediately I can reliably and safely overclock the ram However during the a cold start boot process where voltages fluctuate a lot the same settings will not hold So I am suspecting very bad voltage drops during the boot up process necessitating high voltages than neccessary for overclock settings to hold Also my motherboard has very bad low power settings It will often crash and not wake up from sleep properly Igorslab has also seen weird power peaks during sleep as well
Didnt they say it was a bios issue that allowed the cpu to take more voltage than it should when using xmp and they re rolling out an update soon for all mb bios
gif giphy g79am6uuZJKSc The engineers
Oh man I just ordered a 7800X3D and I don't feel at ease I hope this is just a motherboard side issue so I can just wait and get the revised version motherboards haven't bought one yet because of prices
Thanks Steve
Damn Steve is about to open a can of whoop ass

Please be bad tolerance on socket pins causing arcs because everyone used the cheapest sockets that have ever been made for their overpriced boards Might be way off but it would be hilarious Haven't actually looked into the failure mode because I didn't care to buy 7K series
Honestly if they ever make an electronic product that fails I will plaster incompetence on many levels on every social media facet they have They do great work but sometimes they are the embodiment of akchtually in such a cringe way
This is gonna be good
Time to switch back to Intel
Wonder where all the weird users swearing on their mothers that this is 100 the fault of everyone else and 0 on AMD will be when the video is out A ton people were weirdly running defence for their corporation here while not knowing Jack shit about actual issue or the hardware
Juicy
Can't wait to watch this on my tablet and eat popcorn made on with my smoldering 7950x3D Best 1300 popcorn maker I even bought Prediction motherboard makers actually never made a new bios they just let them run with voltages and parameters for non x3d ryzen 7000 CPUs
Man I Love GN
Definitely holding off on buying a 7800X3D now Damn

It'll be interesting to hear what Gamers Nexus turned up I want AMD to succeed because it makes good products and I want it to learn from its mistakes
The Gamer s Nexus team have taken their name to heart Uniting gamers in the journey of acquiring knowledge
GamersNexus doing the God's work yet again for the consumers Love those people

Let's see y'all AMD nuthuggers defend this one I cannot wait
Are we sure its incompetence and not just a gross underestimation of how stupid the average user is
they created pAMDemic
Like his videos just wish he'd grow just a touch of charisma instead of every video being a dry recitation of numbers and measurements
I guarantee you the issues are just user error If it was actually an AMD design fault it would have manifested ages ago
Entertainment inc
You KNOW AMD and mobo partners were stressing tf out when this started happening and trying to PR damage control with him
Real MVP
ASUS PR get your fire pitch ready Finally we can punch those ridiculous ASUS prices on everything they have
Ew Steve Every year I hate him a little more
hi im going to knowingly misuse some piece of hardware so that it fails because this might have happened once to somebody x200B gamers nexus is kind of cringe some of the videos are great and full of good info and i get they gotta make content but some of the stuff is comical at best
What did I fucking
okay but amd already fixed it with a new agesa update lol
Tech Jesus click baiting another crappy video Color me surprised Put it in writing or GTFO
Sigh many here have no idea how many complexities there are in developing and engineering a product Steve from GN is rolling in cos of the masses of angry incapable youths who like to see his rants and sarcastic critique of companies Imagine GN trying to develop a product more complicated than a t shirt or modmat It would be horrendous
Visible incompetence from his own reviews from failing to pickup this issue sooner
Im still paranoid cos of cracked dies on 6800 6900 XT cards mainly cos solder melts at 250c to 300c and debauer had 1 chip that had melted solder everyone thought was bad deliding attempt at the time probably getting downvoted cos some one will tell it was just bad mining batch cos some one obviously said so damn i love reddit
Looking forward to this one
Popcorn time
Can't wait for this video
I m ready to buy some AMD stock Let s go
Gonna be spamming F5 tonight
incoming Tech Jesus smite
For people saying user error we are talking about a very small niche market Along with a complicated set of variables to cause these issues So I am not surprised there are not more known cases yet I am interested in seeing the details of what GN has found though
Thanks Steve
tech jesus should throw underwear on them
this is going to be spicy
Thanks Steve
Sooo I guess my 7800x3d and Gigabyte board are gonna chill
Waiting to see if it's also tied to the various ranges amps am5 boards outputed this time around Vcore vrms ranged from 60A to at least 110A possibly higher Just hoping like everyone else that their hardware wont brick in a few years just because we enabled expo
hot damn methinks someone is getting fired over this
I can feel the spiciness
My favorite episodes on GamersNexus
Reading this makes me afraid to use my setup at all
Thank god I updated my drivers the moment I got the mobo put Curve Otimiziner to 25 and thermal limited my 7900x to 85 C
I built a new machine not too long ago and I actually underclocked it after getting some temp issues myself I thought I completely fried my machine after a gaming session I'm fairly sure this isn't limited to the 3D V Cache only and all AM5 machines Like I was just using EXPO only with a watercooled machine and it still almost fried itself
Vid release when Need to know if my current setup is safe
I have a 7600X and a B650E F and although there hasn't been any recorded issues with that chip that I know of I'm incredibly scared of the consequences of this
Oh man I'm so out of the loop I was about to buy a new computer do I need to know something important before I do that
After the bios update didn anyone else put expo back on
A video appeared a few minutes ago
v kiTngvvD5dI v kiTngvvD5dI x200B Looks like it's up

Incompetence is GNs favorite go to word when things like this pop up
So probably What could possibly go wrong with using the least expensive devs and constantly building on top of the previous pile of crap
Intel and Nvidia are watching intently
A Mod on ROG forums who appraently works for Asus said you need three things 1 x3d 2 Crazy SOC 1 45V 3 A broken cooler
CRACK THAT FUCKING WHIP STEVE
Always are the best Seeing Tech Jesus lay into big tech is one of the seven wonders of the world
Didn't even say that about 4090 adapter gate so I see this being a very spicy video
I'm interested if that incompetence is solely on AMD by feeding RAM or motherboard manufacturers with bad specifications for EXPO CPU limits safety margins etc or this is also incompetence also on RAM and MOBO manufacture But holy shiet dude after such twitter teaser can't wait for the video
If he just didn't yell at me I'd be hyped for the video He's talking voice is so loud and strained Love the in depth stuff too
It could mean it's many level between engineer dev and marketer levels
The newest 7000 series CPUs can destroy motherboards basically Glad I'm still on 5000
Shoot I have a pizza sitting in the microwave to stay
Depends if its bullzoid then it be good if its the hairy dude then he is like a vampire who sucks interest out of any topic
Just put the bag on top of a 7800x3d with expo enabled and that should do it
It's as Asus employee already explained a an issue where the Soc voltage destroys or malfunction safeguards controls which allows the core voltage to run out of control Hence it's not just pure the high soc voltage causing the melting itself It's a cascade failure that starts with the high soc voltage and perhaps a sprinkle of yields silicon quality where a high soc voltage will only destroy the safeguards on lower quality silicon chips That last part is just pure speculation on my part but can explain why not every chips has the cascade failure and seems to run fine with high soc voltage
I'm glad i didn't wait to get into 7000 series and just got the 5800X3D instead lol
The new studio and testing gear is paying off big for GN They are doing great work for all of us nerds

Linus is the cool dude making tiktoks at office while Nexus works 24 7
Dude is hyping up video clickbait on Twitter This isn't journalism It's social media marketing
Reread what he said I interpret that as it's not just soc voltage but more along with it
AMD probably didn't restrict mobo vendors enough who out of desperation to be competitive in the memory stability scene threw some crazy voltages into the SOC or other parts when high frequency XMP EXPO profiles were applied Or it's user error maybe there needs to be more hand holding for people messing around with things they shouldn't touch
u bet i'll be opening up a cold one for this
What are we chipping what are we beering

Unfortunately I think the reason why he doesn't do it is so that other publications don't put out their own articles with their findings quoting only a tweet when they want need to make people watch the video for that ad money and to give it a boost It could potentially completely bury the video too
Yep
Same I just picked up a microcenter bundle of the 7700x with 32gb of Ram and a motherboard for 367 Thought it was an amazing deal but now if it will die in a year or 2 I wasted my money Hopefully this comes before my return expires
I'm also very curious to see what the impact will be on the proposition of AM5 generally speaking at least at this point in its lifecycle That'll probably be down to who's responsible for what levels of incompetence we're about to bear witness to
Could easily end up being a Pentium 1st gen level I still remember my roommate at the time getting the new chip He took the old one out and didn't know which way the replacement went in It was a 50 50 chance so he plugged the old one in found out the wrong direction and detonated the top of the chip
Free fire extinguishers with your AM5 purchase

Gigabyte PSUs also had no element of user error too
That's what greed does spoiling everything
This is so ironic considering the fear mongering against the 4090 being a fire hazard despite no reported fires Now we have an actual fire hazard lol
Nah the AMD cooler issue was only on a few cards Nvidia's was every single card
The 40 series user element is entirely caused by the faulty and poor design of nvidia Stop playing lawyer for nvidia Jensen doesn't care about you
No it means that there are a lot of trolls here
If it was an actual design flaw it would be manifesting everywhere In reality maybe 5 people globally experienced it and no one else It says to me that some folks were running behind safety limits somehow and burned their CPUs Therefore user error
i refuse to believe that every mobo maker is incompetent and AMD is completely innocent
He tweeted how he hates Asus for throwing AMD under the bus so let s see
incompetence on many levels AMD or Mobo makers Just wait and click the YouTube video to find out Don't forget to smash that like button and click the notification bell
Aren't reviewers also the incompetent ones for not finding these issues with their samples If it is incompetence then surely it would've been picked up
Maybe getting legal advice
super annoying
When I first heard about people using that sort of voltage I was quite surprised Isn't the safe SoC voltage on Ryzen 5000 like 1 2V How the hell did Ryzen 7000 jump to 1 4v especially when stock appears to be closer to 1 0V
I think this is about some 7000 CPUs that have burned themselves up Like literally gone up in smoke
Right there with ya Have a 13700k ready as an alternative
When I heard about the 95C is normal guys first thing I thought about was how I m going to see people complain about their dead CPUs mobos within a couple years lol thats what terrifies me just how much longevity does any Ryzen 7000 even have
bro i would bet 90 amd users are gamers and even in new games CPU temps go at what max 65C Stop with this nonsence that everyone is doing productivity 100 loads 24
I didn't like 95C from the start so I just put this thing in Eco mode Sitting at around 70C in Cinebench Never goes above 75C Performance loss is 2 3 at most and in my sample it's easily offset by applying CO 30 on all cores Same performance at stock 20 25C lower That's just crazy
AMD's steadfast refusal to QC anything is shocking to me They still have the same DX9 driver issues for their GPUs going back 15 years now Thing is the Intel CPU offerings are so bad right now I don't consider them an option and nobody had any idea what Nvidia is doing anymore PC right now is just a major pass As long as people keep buying these companies will continue putting out terrible untested products at high prices But at least Intel had a record worst quarter if we can just get that out of Nvidia and AMD too maybe they'd all have to start trying again
I suggested 5950x to a friend and he had similar issues He wasn't happy with me after Anyways he sold it later expensive mistake I suggested 5600G to literally everyone and all of them are working more than fine Since then I am only suggesting what I have already used first hand That being said there aren't enough am5 cases to make any conclusion
Wait the X3D versions boost infinitely to 95c I thought they were inherintly limited to 200 MHz no matter what the thermals or voltage allowed Are they supposed to do that by design or is this some sort of feature where people are somehow bypassing safety mechanisms
Did the same had a 3900x and went for the 5800x3D roughly same timeframe too
Same here went from a 3600X to 5800x3d The boom the 5800x3d sales got after 7000x3d announcement and release I'd say we're not alone
It's honestly shameful both of these multinational megacorps seem to be brazenly pissing on the consumer in some sort of deviant contest of oneupsmanship It's almost as if they want to lose market share but the other side is playing to lose too And don't get me started on Nvidia that's some sort of unholy trinity of tech right now
yeah honestly every time i think to myself i should buy amd next time a new reason to stay the fuck away shows up
Wait for the video before doing anything
Stone Cold Steve Burke
I would like to watch his videos Sadly I cant stomach the poor language and tone of his videos anymore
Direct and honest reporting wouldn't get views on his videos
He s letting people know they have data and are finalizing video What s wrong with that Judging him for not tweeting more when they have been working a video is stupid
It depends on what he means though It could just be incompetence on the part of multiple entities rather than one entity MASSIVELY fucking up
True
I guess the severity of that statement depends on how focused you believe the finger pointing is The way I interpreted that phrase was that you have user error combined with mobo design failure and something silly with the CPUs AGESA as well
Unfortunately it seems AMD has the worst first gen growing pains of all the major chipmakers however I'd hold off on jumping ship Intel motherboards tend to be better made
I'm not trying to say a lot but if we really want to stick it to them then we may contact Jeremy from the quartering smiling face with open hands
Finally a root cause Where is the root cause I just see hype for a video that may or may not reveal anything useful
Why are you shifting the blame from corporations to the user
You mean AMD user
This isn't the 90s nerds are cool now
I like that about his videos Its his attempts to be 'charismatic' that i cant stand lol
its always the users error when it comes to anything related to amd bruh
Here is a fork and a spoon Dont ask why you'll need them soon
Hard to say The 7800x3D is very popular and launched recently Might be that
Yea the hasty pulling of bios versions gave me the impression of complete panic
Huh Why
Did they
none of their videos are crappy You should be happy that there are people who have a platform to inform consumers and hold megacorps accountable
Can I ask you something I see your name often pop up and every single comment of yours is bordering on some oxygen deprived idiocy Are you that dumb in real life or are you just doing a troll with the name and all
How about you wait for the actual video instead of assuming
I agree I do like his case testing methodology but his criticisms are typically overstated in the most smug manner I ve yet to see him design a case and if he did it would be useless to anyone who doesn t want a hairdryer sitting on their desk
Idiotic ting to say These kind of rare issues is not something you pick up on in reviews You can put a million leads on things use thermography out the ass and you'll never spot it if you don't know what you are looking for
Would journalists even tell us if it was happening or a risk though
Buy an Intel cpu
If you want a Plug 'n Play experience AMD probably isn't topping any of those lists If you like to tinker spend a lot of time in BIOS and want to work on your BIOS updating skills AMD's AM5 platform is a good choice right now to hone your skills Better yet grab a 7900x3d or 7950x3d CPU and you can work on your task management skills as well A lot of successful people are known to have very good task management skills
He essentially just echoes my feelings when it comes to lazy engineers or dishonest marketers There's a certain point where you just look at the product and go what the fuck were these guys thinking actually releasing this garbage and shake your head in disappointment before ultimately just losing your patience and going on a rant
Schrodinger's Steve
Steve's jokes on incompetence are fantastic Can't wait
Steve is generally on the customer's side If he is angry it's because we're getting screwed over It is entertaining when he trashes companies though
So you want him to be stressed and angry
pulled an nzxt is what I've been calling blatantly idiotic designs ever since
New drinking game take a shot every time a gigabyte power supply explodes
Before that this video is sponsored by Nzxt
You know I find that joke a lot funnier now than I did when I still owned strix boards
Although not an intern there's actually very few people who can program bioses because such low levels of programming aren't taught anymore the ENTIRE thing needs to fit on 16 32MB And even if you're a computer embedded engineer the vast majority of jobs will never use it Many motherboard manufacturers' bios team are literally 1 2 people The average age of them is also increasing so it's a time bomb waiting to blow I and GN suspect that this is the real reason for the squabbles with AM4 compatibility Supporting that many CPU's on that many boards with a team that small per vendor was likely an absolute cluster fuck The conspiracy theory that AMD wants to sell more motherboards at the cost of CPU sales is ridiculous I will eat my shoe if AMD's chipset margins are better than their CPU ones lol
He did not say if it was AMD MB vendors or the end user who was incompetent
It definitely won't be sponsored by a motherboard manufacturer lol
THESE CONNECTORS ARE BURNT TO A CRISP WHAT WERE YOU THINKING START OVER YOU FUCKING DONUT
Every industry needs their own version of Gordon Someone who isn't afraid to call people out on their shit and tell it like it is
Steve is so far from Gordon Ramsay So far Gordon Ramsay bashes on people to highlight their mistakes Steve is smug to bash on companies to promote his own content and thoughts If Gordon was like Steve he would bash on other chefs as a vehicle to highlight how great of a chef he himself is which he doesn't do It is sad to see so many upvotes on this incompetence line I hope people would learn to differentiate between the two
When Steve Burke starts dropping F bombs you know somebody messed real good lmao
It'll be the same story as always Corners were cut to make more money Unforeseen consequences occurred now the company is gonna lose whatever extra money they made possibly more Half assing it will always eventually bite you in the ass
I have a feeling the many levels means it's not just AMD but also the AIBs
All of the above probably hence the many levels
Or all of the above That would be fun
Oh how dare they enable expo and leave their pc idling
I think it's more likely the user If it was that heavily on AMD and board makers court like 50 of DIY PCs would be up in flames Anyone running really fast memory where it increases SOC voltage I can't help but feel like a lot of people were manually tinkering with SOC voltage to try and get 6400 stable or an Infinity fabric of over 2000mz stable So they just cranked it over 1 3v and suffered the consequences
This subreddit is amazing Whatever happens wrong with any AMD products someone creates topic looking for some help without a fail you will try to gaslight people into thinking its their fault Meanwhile you can do weirdest shit you can imagine to other cpus including amd and they wont melt themselves Almost like there are certain failsafes that normally work and clearly fail in 7000 series
i doubt its the user given that we dont normally have this kind of info
How can it be them for setting the expo and moving on Don t think we are are expected to be as knowledgeable about this as the engineers involved in design no
all 4
the power socket the power cord and the power supply all putting power directly to the red PCB which is made of match heads soaked in lighter fluid
yo i got grape crush for all of us can i has snacks
You guys needs to eat more healthy
Possibly bad oxide layer in small percentage of CPUs Once it breaks down then a chain reaction leading to a blister
That is probably true Buildzoid speculated about it and he believes SOC alone is not enough power to destroy the substrate the way it is destroyed in that cases
Beta testing is fun arent you bored with hardened BIOS versions with your AM4 system s
Really They didn't pick up these problems in their CPU reviews though
No his nickname is tech jesus He even embraced it himself at one point
TechPowerUp red heartred heartred heart Love a W1zzard article I prefer them to long form over videos
I bought my Tuf before there were any reviews out Man did I kick myself when their review dropped a few weeks later At least Asus learned
Hub does do it exceedingly thoroughly in their specific area of expertise which is just figuring out exactly what cost frame looks like with a wide range of cards They're ahead of GN here despite being a two man team and similarly GN is way way ahead in a bunch of other departments Simply due to them being experts in each field of pc hardware content
DF are too cozy with industry heads for my liking Their coverage of Nvidia's recent shenanigans had hints of soft handedness
Digital Foundry is to be blunt an actual nVidia shill They constantly hype up team green while diminishing or outright insulting team red Hell a lot of their videos are outright sponsored by nVidia Zero integrity
digital foundry doesn't even do any investigative journalism They repeat talking points from developers and do some frame and pixel counting as well as reciting some tech speak they heard at gdc they also shill hardcore for companies that they have cozy relationships with and that provide them with hardware previews see nvidia xbox
Ah damn your right I didn't even think about DF
god no he's spread so much misinformation by just making wild assumptions
Igor has been wrong with every major technical issue in the last few years He just throws out the first thing he thinks of that sounds reasonable and then turns out utterly wrong Mosfets oh no they aren't fully straight That must be it Nope wasn't it it was power spikes RTX 4000 series cables The cables are different of course they are the issue he only got one to melt after damaging the cable never with an undamaged one Issue was users not plugging the cable fully in partly due to being too tough to properly plug in And several more cases like that Igor sucks
I d struggle to call Linus cool

So say we all
EXPO isn't like XMP where there's endless QA and strict regulations AMD kind of handed that off to its partners to handle with more room to change if needed x200B Issue is stuff like this happens
I think to be honest this is mostly a ASUS issue in terms of catastrophic failure if you haven't noticed
Not just that but it sounds like it's an issue difficult to summarize succinctly so he fears if he puts something out they'll be a million articles about it that are oversimplied and or don't have the steps that AIB's AMD need to take to prevent this
The floor under EXPO is lava
My 7700x RMA has been stuck on not being shipped by AMD this entire week I wonder if there is something going on behind the scenes
Nah just a broad BIOS update
Get real It doesn't affect math results There won't be a recall Companies these days don't even recall when the product doesn't perform to spec
Shit I've already used that fire extinguisher while my rx7900xtx was idling with 2 monitors I'm all out of luck
True I thought that one was older though like 2021 The rest of the stuff happened the last few months
If you think 0 04 of all 4090s is every single card well time to take off your red tinted glasses
Its every single card the same way that 8 pin power cables also melt on every single card when not fully inserted or every outlet will melt if not fully inserted with a high enough load if you do it right there's no risk beyond the random crazy event happening card 8 pin connector melted how to evga 550w sfx psu melted gpu cable connector post 17136103 post 17136103 power supply cable melted using 3090 hof
can you give me actual data to support this

Performance benchmarks and quality control testing are two entirely different tests
In order for certain memory speeds SOC voltages have to be raised upwards But not to 1 4V or even 1 45V Thats just insane We're talking from 1 0V 1 2V to 1 1V or 1 25V etc
Shit that s good to know I was putting a new build together and considering going back to amd News like this makes me a little twitchy
Mobile CPUs work years on end at 99 100 degrees and rarely die I don't think that temperature on its own is as big of an issue
My 10 year old laptop's CPU has run at high temps for many years without a problem Those Ryzens are designed to handle running up at 95 C for absolutely ages That's why it's their throttle temp Their actual unsafe temperature for them is 20 C higher where they'll perform an emergency shutdown
AMD probably war gamed it out so that with heavy usage they re expected to last at least as long as the warranty period lol
Agree I run my Zen 4 CPU in ECO mode for that reason 10 performance loss for probably 30 longer lifespan
I m pretty sure with stock settings the 7600X 7900X and 7950X boost and use as much power as possible until they hit 95C then they stay there If you don t have a good cooler hitting 95C while gaming isn t unlikely assuming your GPU isn t bottlenecking AMD stock settings are really bad it s widely recommended that everyone either undervolt or enable eco mode Undervolting can actually give you more performance eco mode shaves off like 5 10 or something like that The stock settings for Zen 2 actually led and is leading to the degradation of a lot of launch units because AMD rams a ton of voltage into one core for the single thread boost
How are the Intel cpu's bad
What DX9 issues
I think it s the chiplets Great for AMD because it cuts cost but I d imagine it adds several steps that normal CPUs don t have Each added step more potential for something to go wrong
Its by design 5800x3d PBO behaves very differently from their AM4 brothers and are more similar to AM5 cpus But they also reach 95c much quicker due to the cache even before getting to 200Mhz allcore However most 5800 X3D and I assume 7000 variants can reach that 200Mhz allcore limit without boosting the voltage that much following the stock PBO curve Mine does that with 0 1 voltage offset AND 20 CO so if there was no limit mine could do maybe 200Mhz more with the stock voltages IF I could cool it
you're one of them british arent you
I didnt mind the old GN when steve appeared more grounded and nerdy Since their growing subs and hitting past 1m subs their content got more ranty for sake of ranting more showmanship baiting longer meandering videos getting higher up their high horses Get to the point already
I am judging him from the many videos ranty ranting for longer air time
I had all sorts of seemingly memory related issues with Intel 12th Gen and DDR5 at launch After weeks of troubleshooting and hardware swapping I gave up returned it all and went back to a 10900k until my current 7950x setup I built earlier this year Now I get to wait and see what happens with this AMD motherboard and memory voltage fiasco long term Neither Intel or AMD has done a great job at launching their latest major platforms from my experiences It makes keeping a stable backup platform for emergencies almost a necessity these days
how about no
Guess we will have to wait and see I am very interested as this video decides if i will return the 7800x3d build or not
Because i've worked with computers long enough to know that you can never make something idiot proof
Yeah sorry difficult to type while eating crayons
If AMD hardware was as bad as people claim it is AMD would be making zero sales and every product of theirs would all be in the bin The fact they aren't says that most issues tend to be user error or people lying
You guys are so weird in this thread
Pervasive negativity and his hardcore fans keep getting more toxic toward other channels I don't disagree with some of his facts oriented features but I don't like his tone I think one of the last things for me was how he handled RTX 3000 and 4000 First the 3090 was the worst thing ever because it was too expensive and not enough faster than the 3080 Now this generation the 4080 is the worst thing because its performance is not close enough to the 4090 It just feels like the focus is usually what got worse instead of what's getting better and the negativity ticked me off Plus I see GN fans trolling smaller channels if they have anything good to say about a product that Steve didn't like as if this is some religious dispute
Their propeganda err marketing department said so
comboam5 1070 for amds ryzen 7000 in detail
every single comment of yours is bordering on some oxygen deprived idiocy Examples Are you that dumb in real life Yes I am this smart in real life or are you just doing a troll with the name and all Not a troll
How about you wait for the actual video instead of assuming How about Tech Jesus put the conclusion in his tweet instead of blatantly baiting YouTube views There's zero way you can defend him in this situation
Thats the whole reason you make a review To spot things general users dont look for If youre just going to parrot the marketing claims of manufacturers then in my opinion you are just as much apart of the chain of incompetence as them
don't these run super super hot and need a lot of energy
In some cases it is sheer incompetence but speaking from experience engineering often knows which areas need more work and wants to make them better It's usually the bean counters that are more date driven than quality driven and won't give them the time
Lazy engineers are not their own managers Never blame people who are not owners or decisions makers They are paid to follow orders not to give customers the best experience If engineers had that kind of power we would have far more tech advancement and options
It's easy to say lazy engineers until you think that Asus probably has like 20 000 employees and literally one person dedicated to work on BIOS for all motherboards Meanwhile 1000 marketing staff 100 engineers in the RGB department and 20 software devs and 20 more UX designers and project managers just for Armoury Crate
hopefully the market corrects this kind of doodoo like its currently doing with nvidia 16gb cards
These are the reasons I wait for that first price drop the first 6 months of a products life has all sorts of issues unless it's just a light refresh
I still go back to the Rocket Lake ones lol
They actually really are
Id pay money to see steve do a tech centric standup comedy special
For someone newer on the space what did NZXT do
Almost as good as pulling a gigabyte
I like using the Pulling a Ford Pinto instead If you know anything about the Ford Pinto you would know that if you got into a rear end collision in a Ford Pinto you would have a first rate barbecue with you as the main course It comes from how Ford didn t reinforce the rear mounted gas tank
There are people willing to learn COBOL code bases if the pay is good
Many motherboard manufacturers' bios team are literally 1 2 people The average age of them is also increasing so it's a time bomb waiting to blow There's not much enthusiasm to be found for maintaining Brand Y gamer AMI UEFI fork IMO the only way to attract new blood would be to commit to open source firmware based on coreboot
It is being taught even in bachelors degree but it was in my uni a specialization at the end of bachelor's degree and most students just aren't interested in that particular branch They're more interested in the concepts of higher programming languages than assembler which we still were taught the basics of in earlier semesters or micro c and respective optimisations
i'm an embedded engineer and i see this as an opportunity also 16MB of space is a lot i've had to program microcontrollers that had 16KB of memory
This uncompressed and unprocessed image is FUCKING RAW
YOU FUCKING DONKEY
WHERE IS THE VAPOR CHAMBER FILLING
Was there anything in my Alienware that wasn't overheated The plastic case wasn't overheated The plastic
YOU ASSEMBLE COMPONENTS LIKE OLD PEOPLE FUCK I know Gordon didnt say that one but its still gold
S people should let companies make things that catch fire and only complain if they personally are effected The purpose is to show in a controlled environment that it can happen and how in order to prove its not just user error so companies can't get away with it before it kills people in a house fire
It helps when vendors assume users are morons and will find new and creative ways to break something Usually the fault of who made the thing lol
Yeah if it really does readily happen with any AM5 CPU these reports are showing up pretty late
Mine died at
So they just cranked it over 1 3v and suffered the consequences I have an MSI x670e Carbon It applies 1 4v SOC 1150mv CLDO VDDP and 1200mv CLDO VDDG in different submenu's without the user's consent or knowledge if you select DDR5 6400 even if you have already manually configured these voltages to safe spec values It does not show up on the X stuff has changed press enter to confirm menu when doing save and exit 6000 applies 1 3v SOC and 6200 applies 1 35v SOC for reference
I doubt it's the users Most users just have expo enabled there's nothing more than that I'm pretty sure it's AMD and the Motherboard vendors
Also my replacement cpu and board ran at 1 35v SOC using standard expo As did many others some were pushing near 1 4v
So most motherboards set SOC voltage DRAM voltage out of the box But just because you're running 1 45V EXPO doesn't mean you need that on the SOC or even the secondary voltage on the DIMMS When I heard about this issue I had not yet configured my EXPO I was stabilizing everything else before touching RAM I turned on EXPO to see what it did and it set three voltages to the DRAM 1 35 of my kit I turned SOC down to 1 2 and the secondary voltage to 1 25 2 days of stress tests a all night session of memory 'm at 1 15V SOC 1 2 and 1 3V for the RAM its been two more days no cooler RAM sticks better overall performance Yeah you need to bump up a couple things with faster RAM but you don't need 25 higher voltage on the SOC I suspect that the default 1 05V SOC will probably work fine but haven't dialed it down to that yet x200B So I'm guessing we have a few layers of incompetence here 1 bad max allowed settings AMD 2 bad defaults when EXPO is on MB makers AMD 3 some other problem related to power delivery MB makers perhaps but AMD designed the spec 4 DIMM makers playing it super safe with higher voltage than needed in their EXPO XMP settings 6000 Mhz doesn't need much voltage with Hynix M or A die 5 Something else probably
If it was simply a matter of user error it wouldn t be incompetence on so many levels nor would Steve have taken to Twitter to pre hype the video Besides hasn t AMD already admitted it was caused by a problem that required a BIOS revision
All I did was enable EXPO II on my 7950x3D and Asus B650E F with 64GB DDR5 6000 kit and the SoC was defaulting to like 1 4v I didn't even know what a proper voltage range was for this on Zen 4 and googling around only gets you random forum threads with people saying it's totally cool for you to pump way more voltage into the SoC this time around compared to Zen 3 and earlier which made absolutely no sense to me Unfortunately I think the damage is already done to my CPU mobo as my system acts very weird sometimes especially when making changes in the BIOS dealing with memory settings It refuses to POST until I reset the CMOS and make it start from scratch It's fubar
I'm saving your corporate defence comment for later when the video is out It'll be fun
7900X with an AORUS B650 board EXPO never enabled nothing besides boot logo messed with in BIOS board auto'd SOC voltage to 1 44v That's not good
Here is the thing though if even De8auer's chip can show visible damage I have a bit of doubt on whether it is purely user stupidity
It's funny I set the Infinity Fabric speed to 2033 MHz and that's was all I did no extra voltage changes I just set it and away I went I changed that based upon a recommendation from one of Buildzoid's videos
users and bad sample but knowing steve they will milk it all day and take their high ground craperbola sick of these internet celebrities milking their followings
I think so too Maybe I'm wrong here but it's my impression failures are coming from manual tuning IF that is the IF not then nevermind It's not been overclockers beware for a long time we got too used to eeking out what amounts to 'allowed' boosts in a lot of cases and if you go outside those bounds there are often ways to reset settings no damage done Now it's not any different than before protections were put in place and people are acting shocked when they brick hardware after tampering with it That's not to say various manufactures should not have those protections but that it reminds me of the old days
Question since 7800x3d is single CCX why does it have an IF interconnection
My SOC was running at 1 315 volts after enabling EXPO II and that's all I did After installing a new BIOS earlier and re enabling EXPO II SOC is running at 1 234 volts
I am very surprised by the user error take What Gamers Nexus is indicating towards has absolutely nothing to do with it being on users but only when the video is live they ll accept the massive misjudgement
I got you fam If the popcorn runs a little stale I got some puff corn as backup
I have
I had to walk upstairs to get it That count as exercise
At this point I m really wondering about chip to chip variation too Someone said bad substrate and while I don t think there s evidence of that specifically it can also be bad lithography causing some sensors to be much more delicate than expected or something else in the manufacturing process that varies chip to chip Substrate or oxide or just manufacturing variation of some kind If early batches and review samples were higher quality silicon perhaps even cherry picked samples without the problems vs later batches running the whole gamut it might have tolerated it Or the cache die being on top of the compute die might have exacerbated the thermal problems which brought the issue to the fore Silicon is getting more and more delicate both electrically and thermally and stacking exacerbates everything Electromigration is super bad these days too Everything is being run an inch from threshold instability and an inch from melting down or electromigrating and it all gets even more complicated with heterogeneous process nodes and 2 5D and full 3D stacking There is no operating margin anymore
They are not doing QA on each product they review they are simply benchmarking
I stopped watching his channel years ago While he might have some good content on occasion he rants too much and makes horrible assumptions on why something went wrong He will blame the engineers and say they did bad work when he has no factual evidence on who made decisions in the company or the team is engineers and he thinks he is smarter than them Also if we are gonna talk about the smartest YouTube tech people he would maybe make the top 10 but barely If we are talking about a tech God I would go with Wendell from L1 techs Der8auer would also be something with higher quality content and actual engineering experience to be able to address these problems and help explain the possible reasons for them
I was being sarcastic but I seem to have missed the mark
Seconding TechPowerUp their written articles are incredibly detailed Digital Trends and HDTV test are also a god send for tv reviews Vincent is incredibly detailed and has a hysterical dry sense of humor and Caleb is at digital trends is close to Vincent in terms of knowledge but doesn t go as deep which is nice at times because I don t always need to know the gray uniformity of a tv
Ye same I always prefer articles over videos It's extremely rare I even watch any vids
Yeah it was quite the episode for Asus Good thing for my friend was that he didn't notice his Strix was a defective cooling model and when I told him to send it in for RMA they sent him back a 6700XT since 5700XT was out of stock
To me DF coziness is a double edge sword on one hand this mean DF often get preferential access and people are more likely to provide more info in official capacity on the other hand yeah DF often softball everyone
can you give me exmaples of that
At this point I m pretty sure they re on Nvidia s pay book
can you give me examples of that
My issue with DF is that they don't focus on the price at all So AMD ends second place because they compare tier to tier In my view the price is what actually determines how exciting the vast majority of products are because the vast majority of them aren't breaking new ground but making things more affordable They also don't really follow up to adjust any changes in price which really ends up hurting AMD If you only watched DF the 3070 is a way better buy over the 6700 XT when right now it doesn't offer much and has less VRAM for 50 more money
Report it for paid promotion face with tears of joy
Digital Foundry is to be blunt an actual nVidia shill But is it actually shilling when it is objectively the truth
How do you not think someone wearing socks with sandals isn't the coolest man ever
Please explain
Imo both AMD and Intel need to be more hands on with this stuff and have needed to be for a long time If they reveal it at their event I'm going to assume it's their implementation It shouldn't be left up to partners
I'm very critical when it comes to Asus AM5 mobos also because I own one however we do not know the failure rate and reports rate Asus has got the biggest online community and is the most popular among high end users It is not surprising their mobos failing get the most publicity
Note that all motherboard vendors have issued bios updates and removed old BIOS revisions
Yea it's gonna be a bios update to restrict motherboard makers excessive out of spec OC This happens every couple of years Think it happened to Intel with one of their 10s cpus were the voltages were pushed super high
Companies these days don't even recall when the product doesn't perform to spec That's a totally different thing Here the products are not not good enough but are dangerously bad
the design was featured in every single card that said the amd cooler issue was a much bigger problem
The design is notably worse than previous GPU plugs for the user's ability to tell when it's fully plugged in That's a problem made worse by the fact that neither type of plug lets the circuit detect if it's in fully
He was saying that even though the issue was user error it was enabled by a flawed design Every card has that same design so every card has the chance of having this if the user screws up
I believe it's just the X3D variants and you have to enable something in the Bios that's not default to cause it I could be wrong though
Yeah and not just phones and tablets Macbooks have had 95C temps for years until Apple switched to ARM
Maybe wish com laptops run at 100C lol They re usually pulling a lot less power at less voltage though The 7600X 7900X and 7950X are all at 95C while pulling a lot of power at higher voltages
This theory doesn't make sense though since AM5 is a platform If the platform is killing CPU's that's a problem

You may be in the wrong sub bro
It's not just great for AMD it's great for us too People act like AMD isn't passing savings on to the customer
My 5800x3d with a 30 CO hit 71 72c in cinebench and barely cracked 60c in any game I tested My 7800x3d hits 82 85c in cinebench and will usually run at 60 70c in games but will have little burst spikes up to 89c in certain games it s definitely WAY hotter than my 5800x3d ever was and has some weird temperature fluctuations
It's just the YouTube and Twitter echo system HUB is the same or I would say much worse Way too much editorializing and personal feelings So I've stopped watching them I still watch Gamers Nexus tho they're still tolerable and have interesting things to say instead of nonstop AMD vs Nvidia rage farming
hair flip mutters in Mandarin Whatever do you mean
Their content has become utterly insufferable lately And I say that as someone who thought they were one of the best Tech Tubers 4 years ago
Also they got more experienced and knowledgeable thus more annoyed by incompetence of the companies and misleading and milking the customers
What are you US Army Ground Trooper or what XD
I don't know why you'd be salty over
It s the way these things go You get clicks with the extreme toxic negativity subject matter Reporting on how large companies pretty much know where to place products in terms or price to performance ratios in order to maximize sales and provide several reasonable options to consumers even if we all wish GPUs cost what they did in 2008 isn t very sexy You need a flashy title like nvidia fails hard and rips consumers with broken 3000 series promises broken
I prefer that over Jon Gruden when he was an ESPN sportscaster for Monday night football he would talk about each player like they were the best at their position
I see I'm nowhere near invested enough to know of such things I watch the selected videos for pure raw data and draw my own conclusions and I feel GN is a great source of putting preasure on manufactuers when they make a bad product whether it's burning PSU pc cases bad prebuilds etc I feel like the things you state shouldnt matter they are informational channels and not some drama shows but I guess people care about what they care Dont get me wrong plenty of things big tech tubers like GN Linus say or do are sometimes wrong or biased but you gotta draw your own conclusions I for example never even look at their FPS charts because I know they dont min max oc each setup nor do they test multiplayer games so often results are far from accurate for my own needs and show inaccurate results
I mean if GN s testing was able to find the issue why wouldn t their internal department be able to Fixing the issue wouldn t be too hard either if it is what they say
Thanks
You need to relax man there's nothing wrong with tweeting about his upcoming content I don't get why you're so mad at him for doing his job
A rare microscopic level flaw vastly beyond the scope of what you look for does not fall under the just 'things you spot' what the fuck You won't ever even know this is a problem until it actually happens It just sounds like you have a hate boner for GN and saying insanely stupid stuff that defies logic just to support your hate boner
Depends on which one and what you're doing In gaming workloads Intel the difference is negligible
It can also be like the developer testing paradox When you've built something yourself you need to have someone testing it because you're subconsciously going to use it differently than most The engineers might've assumed No need to monitor for unsafe voltages because we give mobo makers the right values and it'd be stupid to push 1 4V SOC
There's no revenue in fixing BIOS Sounds crappy but it's the truth People buy whatever they can't justify an extra 5 cost to make sure BIOS is rock solid and updated in a timely manner
I ran into a design flaw two weeks ago concerning the Dodge Magnum I inherited from my Father it s the station wagon version The battery is in the back under the floor mat with the spare tire Well my car wouldn t start so I took the battery out to test it and put it on the charger Seeing as how the car was parked on the street and it was misting I shut the back hatch Well the battery was only at 50 so I charged it and a few hours later took it back out to the car It turns out the door handle for the back hatch isn t mechanical like all the other doors it s electric So with no battery or a dead battery you cannot open the back hatch to access the battery compartment There is a mechanical override but it s on the inside of the hatch door that you have to pop off a small access panel to trigger Well the back of the vehicle was full of items from a play my GF had just directed so I had to spend a half hour emptying the back out through the side doors onto the sidewalk so I could crawl in pop the interior access panel open the rear hatch and put the battery back in Who the fuck designs a vehicle so that you can t access the battery compartment if the battery dies and requires you to fold the back seats down empty it of anything you might be hauling and crawl to the back of the car to open it manually Dodge that s who
I don't think it's exclusively engineers nor is it just their boss making the calls Both happen Boss says I wanna make this cheaper engineer says I can do x and it will save us x boss says do it
Never blame people who are not owners or decisions makers This is a ridiculous way to look at things It's not at all difficult to find places where workers do their jobs badly Halo Infinite is my go to example That game was given all the time in the world and it fails on so many levels It launched and still has all kinds of technical issues 343 got to delay their game a year push deadlines cancel promised features and they still sit with a mess They were coddled and didn't deliver I've worked with people whose failures are their own doing People who were in well protected unionized workplaces and responded with abusing their opportunities and never experienced accountability or consequences I'm sure the engineers aren't out there looking to kill devices like this but I'm pretty confident management doesn't want this either Laying all the blame on management makes no sense when these are clear engineering flaws I don't see why we shouldn't look at the workers when work goes this badly
I've been an early adopter a few times and had all sorts of fun after
They had an adapter that was designed in a way where the screws would damage the PCB expose the power rail short then cause a fire First they tried to deny there was even a problem then they tried to fix the situation by mailing people plastic screws Only after GN got involved with enough testing and hard data to make it undeniably their fault and got enough coverage about it did NZXT finally do a recall and redesign the product
NZXT had a riser kit that was a fire hazard v fjUscSRLwks
Gigabyte didn't design or manufacture those PSUs though so it's not the same
Pretty sure I pulled a DOS once
I think it's a chicken and egg issue Low velocity and the work being so important means that it's damn hard to get into the field Since a company won't trust someone new on something as massive as this And Cobol isn't used for unimportant projects because so few know it and are very busy So people don't pursue it since it doesn't get them a career And the few people who can do it are so overworked that they can't really train people up It's just another tragedy of companies not willing to standardize in any way to give them enough time to truly train people up As well as a lack of UBI and current lack of affordability causing anything that isn't a hobby or something that can advance your career being viewed as a waste of time
I mean money and an entry point for those new to it would be enough Not all devs are Ultra passionate about what they work on I work for a corporate pharmacy for example
In my case Computer Engineer they taught a bit of assembly as a precursor to it Imo it's not a matter of lack of interest There's a shit ton more CS students than in the past Imo it's because the landscape moves quickly and not enough time for most to learn something they won't use Unless it actually is their hobby even then COBAL and bios programming aren't really as accessible as high level programming For a hobbyist project there aren't many applications where you'd want to use it over a microcontroller like an Arduino
Underated comment lol
Lmao that salad quip was a top 3 moment for me across all of Ramsay's media
Have a look at this comment
Consumers will try to do unreasonable things with a product deny it and blame the manufacturer Always If the OEMs didn't anticipate it it's their own fault
Been running a 7950x under heavy rendering loads with expo memory running at 6000 for months now I'm assuming the non 3d chips aren't as susceptible to voltage problems
It's probably mobo makers All CPUs affected by the same issue sure but only X3d CPUs burned as they're the only sensitive ones to voltage You can't make it not sensitive if that's what the hardware is limited by meaning you have to make sure it doesn't happen My best guess is failure to prevent massive voltage spikes failure to control voltages specifically for x3d failure to communicate the issue remember Asus removing bioses quietly and so on And could be at fault with agesa stuff but then more manufacturers than just 2 3 would have issues
But did it die due to voltage or was it simply faulty
It died from the same reasons shown here Did you have the burn mark on your die CPU and motherboard as well Or could it have been a death not really related to this problem
But that is also highly unlikely to be reproducible like Steve mentioned
I have R7 7700 my mobo is putting on bios defaults 1 368V to SOC manually reduced it to 1 15V after this shitstorm started as i was not interested in any overclock Bought much better CPU that i require to not care about overclock
That's pretty bad then I checked the GSkill 6000 cl36 memory my brother got running on his Gigabyte board and his is reporting under 1 3v I think it was like 1 28v But I haven't heard anyone have these issues on Gigabyte boards yet
Same here 7700x using XMP
For me my b650 p from msi with expo gave 1 368v to the soc
Mine was over 1 35v stock once docp xmp enabled
2 doesn't require EXPO It's often triggered by a setting which EXPO changes such as the memory frequency not EXPO itself If i go into a clean BIOS with my MSI x670e carbon and set the following 1 1v vdd vddq vddio mem 1 05v SOC 850mv cldo vddg 800mv cldo vddp DDR5 6400 save and exit Do you know what happens The SOC VDDG and VDDP are all in a different menu At the last step there setting DDR5 6400 these voltages are changed without the consent or knowledge of the user to the following 1 4v SOC 1200mv VDDG 1150mv VDDP These voltages are applied on the save and exit yet do not show up in the confirmation box
HwInfo shows CPU VDDCR SOC Voltage under the CPU sensor readings and further down under my motherboard I have CPU VCORE Soc Why is there two with different readings I set my SOC in BIOS 2 months ago to 1 22v and that is the first one but the 2nd one I mentioned is doing whatever it wants It's up to 1 28v
Deafault voltages are high to accomodate for the worst CPUs around in terms of silicon quality bad bins that went through nevertheless because they were just barely OK they need to work on all systems Most CPUs are obviously not the worst some are very good so in most cases any given CPU will run at lower voltages than defaults sometimes much lower if you've won the silicon lottery Given how the production system of CPUs work binning there isn't much that can be done about it there's always a spectrum of silicon quality that the mobo needs to accomodate to There's no marker in the CPU to tell the mobo if it's a great bin or just OK So the default voltages will always be at the level of the worst and not the best silicon to make sure they all work For that reason if one wants to lower the voltages lowering the temps and prolonging the chip's life they need experiment just like you did to find the lowest working voltage
I thought I was stable with 1 2v SoC and my DDR5 6000 but I wasn't Kept crashing in Deep Rock Galactic until I turned EXPO completely off
That if you are assuming steve has done their tests on hundreds of samples asus have many cpus to test amd too msi gigabytes asrock same GN has to milk their viewers
You're the one jumping to conclusions instantly condemning the evil corporation I'm saying it could go either way And in some way it is the AMD's fault not restricting what board vendors do anyways
Damn I have a gigabyte boards and it doesn't seem to do that Do you have a really old BIOS I wonder if Gigabyte was doing this as well earlier on than what I'm on
My auorus b650m had the soc set to 1 25 I turned it down to 1 2 and haven't had any issues with expo as far as I know
Didn't he kill his while overclocking
Well not with that attitude
It still talk to the IO die that also has the integrated graphics and that talks to the memory and other things And they wouldn't design a new architecture and get rid of the infinity fabric just to make 8 cores The whole design decision around it is based on servers and 64 core processors with like 8 core dies and even the desktop 16 cores still need it And even Intel's single die CPUs still have a ring bus or something similar So even if they deigned a single die chip they need need a communications bus I'd imagine even the single die APUs use infinity fabric as well
What frequency is your RAM and what brand motherboard
All that it happens even with default settings aside On 5000 series ryzen u can do whatever in bios and cpu wont melt itself Period Clearly theres something goin on with 7000 series that didnt happen with 5000 series So its either on AMD or mobo manufactures Considering Gamers nexus post and what he said it rather points to not an user error I hope that you at least own AMD stock or something otherwise your defending is rather silly Its a product you are consumer AMD statement dosent suggest user error either
Can t wait for the video because if that s true that is insanely fucked up by those users
Stuff like the GPU and CPU performance comparisons are so good I wish you could merge that data with PC PartPicker for VFM reasons
Third TPU Their site is invaluable for info and reviews
Yeah I appreciate what they offer and their ability to ride that very thin line They're a great balance to GN's ability to also secure exclusive technical access with while dropping hit pieces EVGA leaving Nvidia Hell they tweeted s 20 they had just left AMD headquarters prior to working on their upcoming melting AM5 investigation piece lol Who else does that
show me some proof

You just named several reasons why he's an awful source Even if he had any skills you'd have to throw a dice if he just guessed some random crap or did his work properly this time around Based on his track record I'm ignoring him entirely at this point
He is saying that you are clueless cuz your name is captain clueless lol
No what I am saying is every single report of catastrophic CPU blowing up I have read about has been from a Asus motherboard That can't be a coincidence
The were two different suppliers for the design en variants of connectors per card
Thats fair It doesnt have a strong click like some 8 pins It still does click just really subtlety and people can assume its in all the way when its not Thats why its good to give a small tug or wiggle to make sure it can't be walked out Which people seem to be able to do now since there hasnt been any melting reports in a long while aftee the gamers nexus video and the nvidia press release I do think shortening the sense pins is also a good idea so it won't recognize as plugged in unless its all the way in
Macbooks were infamous for hitting 95C until Apple switched to ARM
AMD APU in the steam deck hits 100 C and its considered normal
They re really not though Did everyone just forget how long they milked the 5600X at 300 The 5600 didn t come out till close to a year later They tried it again with the 7600X
They don't They killed Ryzen 3 beacuse of Chiplets
Yeah thats clearly by design and why I don't like those as a concept at all needing to actively do something to stop bad things happening instead of that being the passive default state Because it's not just hardware can be data or a proces too Had a huge discussion with an external supplier of data visualisation dashboards why I wouldn't just supply the entire database including possibly sensitive variables and let them hide filter the unused sensitive ones for the end user Or in the very early reporting automation days why a colleague team needed to manually check a box every week after inspecting the auto generated report instead of signalling afterwards to fix the report with the risk of sending a faulty one to key
HUB went to crap after GN Its been the slow evolution Their scripts are being written by JayZ
I base my decision on if there is a serious problem if i am affected by this how to fix it and how the potential fix affects performance Worst case scenario i just return the 7800x3d build stick to the 5800x3d build and see what intel has to offer later on instead

skullskull Then we get driven to smaller channels until those channels get bigger and either become marketing platforms or hate counterculture merchandise platforms I still watch LTT but it's almost like a Martha Stewart show now complete with special guests But they got all of these side channels that sometimes have more interesting content than the main channel x200B Crap now I want to see the old spear shield meme with Linus' screwdriver being wielded against Steve's assembly mat
Oof early Linus
Yeah a lot of games bench completely different in multiplayer or Cyberpunk is much more CPU limited in real play than the benchmark would have you believe RTX 3080 1080p RT psycho more than 90fps but in the market it's 45 33fps on a 5600X and 62 45fps on a 5800X3D For stuff like VR especially I will look into the game community instead of watching a 'youchoob bideo' but for general info and new product announcements I watch a few channels
I just hope it's fixable without a huge performance hit Just built my system would seriously p ss me off to go back a gen in performance
I don't get why you're so mad at him for doing his job His job is to milk YouTube views Which is fine But people need to stop acting like he's something more than that
But for work I don't game at all
I have a 2022 Ford Mustang Mach E which has a 12V battery inside the frunk The only way to get into the trunk is via an electronic popper that is activated by your phone or by a mechanical release in the driver s footwell which requires that you have the driver s door open The driver s door opens electronically as well So if your 12V battery is dead you can t do either of these things and have to open a little door in the front bumper and apply 12V to the wires there to power the frunk popper All this is to say they are still making the same dumb choices on new electric cars too
I've seen more than one normal car you have to take a front wheel off to change the battery There are some criminally bad designs out there
It would be nice if they still had the traditional key to open but I do understand it's a pretty rare event And you wouldn't want the mechanical release to be accessible from the outside or you know people could use that to easily get in your car It does worry me a bit about my Escape though It notorious for a self draining battery which is also in the back under the spare tire under a large cover Though it does have connections in the hood you could boost from to open the back hatch I wonder if yours has similar
That German influence do be strong in that era of Dodge when Daimler Benz was at the helm The new Cadillacs have electronic glove boxes The option to open close lock unlock them is buried a couple menus deep via the touchscreen infotainment system face with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughing Hilariously stupid
My gf's elderly mother gave her an anxious phone call because she was trapped in her Kia Niro which had an aftermarket rear hatch tent on it with the hatch up obviously According to some internet people there's no actual light switch for the dome light so the only way to keep from draining the battery is to pull a fuse
So the back doesn't have any hydraulics My shitty dodge caliber at least has that lol
My wife's 2013 Ford Escape had the battery die and the doors no longer lock The only one that you can lock is the driver side with the key
Tesla's Model S has a similar but that only charges the main batteries There is still a 12V accessory battery and if it dies you can't unlock open the car Which means you can't pop the hood James May did a whole video on v NsKwMryKqRE
So with no battery or a dead battery you cannot open the back hatch to access the battery compartment There is a mechanical override but it s on the inside of the hatch door that you have to pop off a small access panel to trigger What in the world Some manager probably thought Oh that'll never happen anyway because we put a single line of fine print in the service manual that says Vehicle must be provided with external power before during and until after performing any battery disconnect and or change I'll take What could go wrong for 500 Alex please see no evil monkey
You are going to love EVs like Rivian or Lucid they have 2x 12V batteries You cannot even touch them because it will void the warranty
I have been in meetings multiple times where my teams says we cant do that for X reason directors proceed to decide we are going for the cheap
There is also the issue with their fan software which is absolute shit It takes forever to start after the computer turns on Even worse the software randomly freezes and the fans stop working until you reboot They ve issued fixes for this thrice now It s absolutely shameful that an open source software was developed to replace the shitty nzxt software so people would have something that actually works
The worst part is we live in a world of denial Most companies are irresponsible scammers rule no 1 same as in politics and the government military seems to be deny and deny and deny untill it goes away or you are forced to act because else a huge loss is unavoidable or your ass is about to get kicked Fucking risk takers 'till the house is on fire it's all calculated
It was not designed that way at all That was the root cause of the problem The board did not have mounting holes in the correct locations so some idiot decided that drilling a new hole was the answer The solution was to get a board that was designed with the right mounting hole locations
I mean it wasn't a blatantly idiotic design it was a design oversight The real problem was how they handled it Fractal had a similar issue with their fan hub and they handled it infinitely better
Yeah on that Gigabytle PSU debacle I put some of the blame on ODM and newegg too ofc Gigabyte could have recall but still
Yes thats the point Management and the bean counters need to see there are consquences for pushing out unfinished products so they can get fixed and hopefully get better in future And doing things this badly is incompetence it doesn't need to be the engineers being incompetent management incompetence is just as important to point out
Not really there was a report of 7900x suffering the same fate as x3d chips
Someone else mentioned that voltages don't go nuts until they entre 6200 or 6400 territory At 6000 it's still safe That could explain it The people buying that 6400 RAM for AMD systems might might not be very common
Why The I O die is the same That's where the SoC voltage goes and that's where the actual damage on the substrate was
CPU's are insanely reliable parts when adhering to engineering spec I have CPU's that have been cooking Folding home for over a decade and still work flawlessly But even slightly more voltage can wear down the silicon logarithmic faster So any CPU that fails at all you can generally assume it was caused by voltage Some by heat but those are cases where the plastic is left on the stock coolers etc
the only thing that i have atm is the ram set to ddr5 6000 as apparently it was running as 5300 This was you applying an overclock because you didn't like one of the CPU specs The memory controller's spec is DDR5 5200 in the best of situations but as far down as DDR5 3600 for certain configurations
I think debauer mentioned something about gigabyte boards being affected too in one of his videos
1 28v is a setting value of 1 3v with some normal voltage droop
You said it's more likely user error to try to defend AMD
lmao
Yeah I've got F2 which I think is from september last year F4 was available when I checked a week ago but I was too lazy to update F5b became available a couple days ago but since I manually set the voltage to 1 25v and still not using EXPO I'm holding off for non beta BIOS
what BIOS version did your board come with did it have when that was set I'm still on F2 waiting for the F5non b
No he showed a different chip in video in regard to this ''burning'' issue I vaguely remember he said this cpu is just for personal use
DDR5 6000 Asus I suspect there are a lot like me who just turned on EXPO II etc and didn't know the voltages were too high
One incredibly underappreciated aspect of GN is that they don t use review samples If you ll recall HUB pissing and moaning when nvidia cut them off from samples and then walked it back that s not an issue for GN on multiple levels because not only is Steve GN not Steve HUB on an editorial level but he s not even taking samples in the first place so there s nothing to cut off even if they wanted to
It s highly suspicious DF get prioritisation as the first and single only place to get extra early hands on nvidia cards new tech features with permission to make early broadcast videos that seem to surmount to nothing more than advertising videos for nvidia as there s never any criticism at all let alone mention of the ridiculous profiteering pricing There has to be a reason they re getting this special treatment
Thats not how truth works You just have people deny truth but doesnt stop it being true Edit the idea that facts of truth is subjective is to the detriment of everyone in every aspect
Nvidia isn't objectively faster than AMD
Alternate facts
Uhm what
So you're agreeing that my original comment is factual
There were reports from MSI ASrock and Gigabyte as well Iirc a Gigabyte one reportedly even was on FIRST boot up Someone I've read suggested that hte ASUS lean comes from ASUS Market Share with Motherboards i think he said that ASUS has a large if not hte largest share So if the problem has a say 0 001 chance to happen if 10 000 000 ASUS MBs have been sold and only 1 000 000 ASRock boards for example it will still have happened to more ASUS boards
It isn't it just a limited scope of your readings so far there have been reports of the same thing happening on Asrock and Gigabyte boards
I do think shortening the sense pins is also a good idea so it won't recognize as plugged in unless its all the way in If they can make it work as a retrofit it's a great idea But I'll wait until I see it tested
Imo shortening the sense pins is the best approach since they'd only need to update the adapter instead of the entire card
I live in America why wouldn't I care about saving hundreds over the life of my CPU on energy bills Why would I buy a more expensive K skew when I can simply by any AMD cpu and mid range mobo I can put a year old 5800X3D that hangs with this generation in a six year old X370 motherboard I paid 60 for in April 2017 Meanwhile Z270 is stuck with an i7 7700K Troll harder next time
Live in America buy K skew Not sure if you're trolling or being serious
Should have rephrased that Chiplets give them extra pricing flexibility and allow them to undercut their competitors when necessary If Zen 3 was monolithic they probably wouldn't be able to sell a 5600 for 130 like they ended up doing and actually profit
They killed Ryzen 3 because yields were good so need to cut down perfectly working chips vs reducing average selling prices And also because it didn't make sense in the market Last gen Ryzen 5's are dirt cheap and have 50 more multicore performance Games have some scalability to 6 cores or the OS has it And also because AM5 is a new platform that for a while had a steep entry cost So honestly it just wouldn't make sense
You live up to your name quite well

Better for the vehicle to have to be towed to the dealer so they can make some then the vehicle be user friendly Capitalism baby
Yep I'm a hard pass on any vehicle that has electronic door latches or rear hatch lifts I will drive my Civic 30 more years if I have to If gas cars get banned I will switch to Uber and and e bike
That s why you get a Tesla
Another bad design from Dodge The Chrysler Sebring and the Chrysler 200 were like that
Plenty of we warned you or I told you so moments eh Sounds about right I'm not an engineer but similar things have always happened with my bosses If only they'd listen beforehand
To be fair some of the fan control software for motherboards is terrible as well that seems to be a widespread issue in the industry
Deny 'till proven guilty
In the aforementioned case some houses almost literally WERE on fire
The holes weren't even the right size for the screws The power plane was way too close to the holes None of it was grounded correctly Absolutely moronic
Yes they handled the matter very poorly even though the technical error wasn't their own the product had their name on it and they should have done a lot more
Maybe caused by a bios update to include the 3d chips then We really started seeing reports after they came out
Like my old EE prof hammered us Root Mean Square for electronic tolerance is 70 7 You can run everything at 70 7 of peak voltage forever Anything above that slowly degrades the farther above the faster the burnout
Well there is a big warning for majority option about overclocking but not for this field It is also named something like ram type and on the lists you are choosing stuff like DDR5 6000
Yes but you implying my intentions is what I have an issue with This isn't an attempt to protect a company I was just pointing to the logical conclusion from the evidence I heard up to that point and my own experience building 2 PCs and not seeing SOC voltage higher than 1 28v
We do know that Many users have reported unsafe SOC voltage being set just from turning on DOCP or EXPO
It dosent have to be many It may only be small percentage of mobo or cpus affected for whatever reason there really is to it It dosent mean that every cpu will die with just expo turned on Some CPU just die some melt contact pads and socket some basically desolder itself like one in De8auer video It can be both extremely rare and not user fault at the same time 2 3 week ago community was saying its fake and fud that de8auer got prepped CPU now we moved on to user error What the next goal post And all that aside no other CPU series in last 10 years could literally do that no matter what you would do in bios Theres multiple layers of protection to prevent that and most of them are not possible to remove without tampering with microcode bios
That can t be right there s no way GN could do day 1 CPU GPU release content without being given the products prior to retail release
I'm pretty sure they use review samples since they got the 7950x3D review out at the same time as everyone else but specifically mentioned they needed to overnight a 7900x3D from a source to get that ones vid out on time since AMD wasn't sourcing it GN doesn't accept any extra incentives though like some companies have sent them gift cards and such for times where they fly out for conferences and shows GN lit one on fire on camera lol Using review samples is fine and HUB was rightfully frustrated at Nvidia for them being blacklisted and Linus tore Nvidia a new one for it
X company is better faster than Y company is exactly the line of thinking that got us to where we are Choose products based on their merits performance and price according to your needs and means not an allure of the fucking brand name
no it was 100 wrong
Where is the actual reports and evidence of CPUs blowing up on other boards other than Asus Genuinely curious
MSI TOO STRONK DRAGON WINS ONCE AGAIN FINALLY COMPETING WITH BIOSTAR
If Intel didn't released ADL you wouldn't be able to use 5800X3D on your X370 board Neither you will be able to do it Unofficial way like 9900k on Z170 beacuse of AGESA
Little column A little column B upside down face
Recently it s been Intel bringing the value imo 12700KFs were on same for 250 last month and have been around 300 for a long time i3 12100 has been around that 120 price since it came out and it s a better gaming CPU than the 5600 I think AMD won on value once or twice and now everyone just ignores Intel lol
It's not yield related issue beacuse there's EPYCs with 1 2 4 Core Chiplets Which is perfect candidate for Ryzen 3 Other is true though But would be better If there was some competition against i3
I have good faith in GN after them going deep on the 4090 12vhpwr issue but i have also been around for long enough for this to potentially be the third time AMD screws me over K6 Bulldozer i just want to know if i can enjoy the new build or move on really
Please explain
ah okay so AMD still is the way to go for productivity My 7950x does 35500 at about 140 watts Didn't even think about going Intel since I had an 5950x before and really liked it I just suspected a bit of possible buyers remorse
Nah afaik towing companies know how to open them on the spot But it's still a PITA
After all the pointless labor they probably don't even make much money The only sure thing is that the consumer loses But hey if they spend too much money on stupid electronic things failing they will just give up and buy a new one right
My mother had a Hyundai Tucson that required you to unscrew the battery bolts from within the front wheel wel so American cars aren't the only ones guilty of this Don't even get me started on Suzuki That was the only car I've ever had that required you to unbolt parts from the engine to reach the oil filter the oil filter was behind the water pump That was definitely well beyond the point where efficiency should have taken a back seat to practicality
Yes but at least the actual fan RPMs are decided by the motherboard firmware so you can just not use the fan control software
What is the best alternative I use ASUS AiSuite and it sucks
Looking at you ASUS Aura is ok but they completely and utterly broke it when they integrated it into Armory Crate Mobo software in general is God awful It's hilarious when my PC is lightning fast but the Gigabyte App Center acts like it's running off a hard drive being turned by a hand crank
Well I posted in some other thread the results of updating bios on my Asus x670e from 0821 to 1409 a few days back And guess what SOC voltage went up from 1 24 under load to 1 36 And that's using 7950x Rolled back immediately
Many more people have AM5 systems in April 2023 than did in December 2022 The absolute incidence accelerated but that's not clear evidence that the rate did
What is the significance of 70 7 like where does that number come from
That is a good point there should be a proper wall around overclocking vs safe tweak settings
There are many ram kits with VSOC 1 4V in the spec sheet So the ram is officialy rated at 1 4V and the MB sets VSOC accordingly to 1 4V when you use a feature that is officially advertised by AMD So where is the user error
You jumped to conclusions to defend AMD yes There is no evidence this is user error
They did so with Zen 2 at least got the samples from sources not AMD
Thats not how that works again Adopting post truth theory is to the detriment of everyone
Choose products based on their merits performance and price according to your needs and means If you do that you reach the conclusion that Nvidia is objectively the best choice
I could craft benchmark runs that make either amd or nvidia appear faster Exactly You could craft situations where AMD is faster but they are all completely irrelevant
LOL if you think
I didn't save the reports but there were people who had it happen who told us that they didn't use an ASUS Board Do you think tthey are such major ASUS Fanboys that they'd claim to have a different MB when something goes wrong When i search for stuff it's mainly the general reports including one specific Reddit Thread One of the Articles by Igor's Lab specifically mentions Gigabyte as one of the manufacturers that had it happen and I do remember at least one ASRock report But the reports ARE there and the fact that ALL of them are in Oh Crap mode and updating their bioses to limit SoC V and the AMD AGESA update should tell us enough AMD's official statements also sound more like a more general instead of ASUS was dumb lol issue
iirc there also was an MSI one
I bought the best upgrade already for my AM5 motherboard I can still use the older shit though I have incredibly cheap electricity from the sun using less power earns me more from the electric company for offsets in the winter Saving more money is the same as getting a higher paying job but why would I do that when I run my own business Troll better next time

It's Intel's lack of an upgrade path that bites for me Even though some find 3 4 years too soon to upgrade AMD keeps their last gen CPU's as part of their lineup and sells them for cheap So you can upgrade the CPU later on in the generation Many people upgraded from 1600 2600 3600 to a 5600 5700X since AM5 came out And since AMD is keeping them around for low prices they don't have to deal with scalper dicks The 5600 being 130 puts huge downard pressure on the 3600 2600 and 1600 on the used market Meanwhile the 11400 is like 120 used if anyone with an 11th gen board could upgrade to 12 13th gen that wouldn't be the case yes I know the actual socket changed this time but Intel will break compatibility regardless of that Upgrade paths keep the overall platform affordable on the used market in the long term Whereas with Intel you have to hunt down specific CPU's and boards on the overpriced used market It's sort of like how backward compatible consoles make last gen consoles super cheap as people don't have a reason to keep the old one when they upgrade 12100 may be faster than a 5600 in some games but its also a quad core so I'd say they trade blows
As someone who spent most of his adult life in the automotive industry I would say you re overestimating the knowledge of the average vehicle owner and tow truck driver
Ya if it keeps breaking just get a new one
Good point there
Then you get one with an inherently broken fan controller that sometimes crashes when your read the FAN RPM values inverting the fan curve shutting all fans off setting them to 100 or doing other fancy stuff That's how I learned that the minimum clock speed of my 3700X is 550 MHz For example the one built into an Asus Prime X470 Pro
Argus Monitor is really good for a general fan control that works with basically everything It's very customizable Cool feature is that you can control your case fans based on GPU temp instead of CPU most softwares don't allow that from what I've seen It was extremely useful for me when I did a custom cooling mod on a graphics card because I couldn't run a pump or fans off of the GPU itself and had to power them from the mobo
I use FanControl It s a little complicated i d almost say there is a learning curve to it but once you do underdtand the program it is so useful it requires practically no resources and it doesnt bother you all the time looking at you asus
Find out the fan speed curves that you want and configure it in bios saves u a piece of bloatware and it always works
Armoury Crate is so bad Asus had to release a separate tool to properly uninstall it Corsair iCue's installer is over a gigabyte NZXT CAM is HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY You said it manufacturer mobo fan AIO RGB control software SUCKS pretty much universally
Exactly I ve stayed on 0821 from the beginning X670E A and my 7700x SOC has never went over 1 288 these problems started when the bios updates went out for X3D chips
That would require a much much longer introduction to electrical engineering but basically the average heat dissipation of an AC current works out to 70 7 percent of its peak voltage when using DC current So electronics that burn up at say 5 volts think capacitors etc would theoretically be able to tolerate 3 54 volts forever without any fear of degradation or overheating This is used a lot for overclocking because you know you are shortening the lifespan the farther you stray from the RMS and approach peak voltage Things like memory and CPUs are already pushed beyond the RMS to get to an acceptable lifespan performance tradeoff level
And at the time you jumped to conclusions defending users despite the fact there wasn't much evidence it was boardvendors
From what I've read it's a cascading failure and the SOC voltage being too high is the first step The SoC voltage being too high isn't the only oversight that results in this issue but it is the catalyst This is probably a deferred responsibility problem We don't need CPU level safeguards for this because it will slow us down and we already gave mobo makers the proper voltages and expect them to use them While the mobo makers are like Cranking up these voltages marginally improves benchmarks If it was actually bad for the CPU AMD would have blocked it AMD probably tested while developing the chip with safe voltages then released the standards to AIB's to make boards obviously the board can't be made before the CPU lol

I know so
I don t know how many people actually did an in socket upgrade I think a lot of that is just bluster Yeah I m sure someone out there popped a 5800X3D into the dilapidated POS b350 motherboard they bought 6 years ago but I doubt it was a lot Lisa Su herself said they ve only sold like 80 million AM4 compatible CPUs total Intel sells multiples of that number yearly Buy the best for what you re doing right now Trying to plan years into the future just to save like 150 200 on a motherboard is just hilarious to me especially when you have no idea if the next generations are going to even be good relative to the competition And the newer motherboards are going to be better and support more features too I d say it s a very minor tie breaker Practically it s not very useful but it does give good mindshare I guess
Tow truck drivers in the Netherlands can do it t 852
I'm going to use that Gigabytes SIV and App Center are horrific and break regularly
It s called FanControl by rem0
I've found it to be very useful love that you can set case fan to ramp up with GPU temps I even have it set to increase CPU fan if the GPU is under load so it helps keep FPS up
They finally released a tool When I upgraded mobo's last year built in uninstaller required you to have an ASUS motherboard So since I upgraded before uninstalling my options were either the registry variety hour or reinstalling Windows Oh yeah and Windows apps weren't properly portable but it still wouldn't let the new install delete them So I had to copy everything off my game drive format the drive copy everything back and then re download them all
I feel like Asus has been pretty lazy with their boards and quality the last 5 10 years and just using their name to sell products This whole thing reminds me of a while ago when it was found out that some MB makers were pushing extra voltage on their PBO OC to beat their competitors but pushing too much voltage that increased heat and could damage chips Think it was on AM4
No That's not what happened
No it is objectively provable If people refuse to agree on the truth of what problems face society nothing will ever be solved or improved The debate should never be able what the problem is it should be about how to solve said problem Pragmatism is more important than tribalism Regarding your comment on trees has no use doesnt mean that those truths do not exist That is a very reductionist view and again helps no one including the person who holds that view
Do you research throw away this silly crowd mentality and choose PRODUCTS not companies That's exactly what I do Not sure why you're misunderstanding that
Nvidia also wins CUDA and AI workflows etc RT also isn't really a gimmick it's probably the future We just can't run it nowhere as good yet for it to be a deal breaker to most people bit it's slowly getting there

A 5900x for 3 Was so I find these Amazon returns outlets
Finally someone doing what I've been preaching Vss is the voltage supply pins Vss neg is ground Vss pos is positive voltage on CMOS ICs sometimes you'll see Vdd being used instead of Vss pos as a throwback to the days of NMOS and its terminology even on CMOS ICs Electrically they're going to be in parallel with eachother so losing a few means that the others will see a slight increase in current per pin That's acceptable when we take into consideration that A they add some margin to ensure functionality and B it's made to handle the 5950X's current draw some extra margin which is higher than your 5900X's so it'll just knock it slightly further towards that in terms of current per pin
Would undervolt curve optimize and call it a day It was 3 don't worry too much about it
I'm not experienced in the safety of this kind of stuff but I just came in to say PHENOMENAL job on straightening the pins without snapping a single one
My 3200G has 1 missing pin and it's working fine for 2 years now Not only in the system but with benchmarking a bit of gaming and video rendering editing in this time span
if it sits it fits
Just solder on replacement pins I got my 3900x for free the same way Straightened the pins with an empty mechanical pencil and then soldered replacement pins from an old cheap cpu
UPDATE Here is the video of the process they actually aren't A user pointed this out to me The VSS pin on that corner remains intact However the actual pins damaged are AZ RST L AZ BITCLK These pins only control the onboard chipset audio Therefore everything is operational except I have no line out Only USB audio I will install a PCI e sound card and be on my merry way The CPU works just as it should Pinout diagram here Please upvote to let others know
I had some bent pins and I fixed them back and I think I even have few missing It doesnt boot when I put rams with space but launches fine when i put the ram slots closely I'm not knowledgable if its running at full potential but most of the time they can work without an issue I'm using my 2600x like that for 2 years
It is azalia hd audio pins
Damn what a steal You could've easily sell it for profit in the original damaged state not to mention now If you want to keep it make sure that not just the CPU but also RAM work as intended Do some benchmarks gaming and monitor the system and as someone else said if it works it works
There are tons of vss ground pins on the socket well over a hundred I got tired of counting so you will be fine Tis but a flesh wound
You gotta tell us WHICH store You can't leave us in suspense mate D
Undervolt that jammer and pat yourself on the back Good work fam
Don't ever run bios update and let it run forever
If it works it works
Deal of the century Congratulations
Tell me your secret for finding stuff like this If you are good with know someone who is good with a microscope and soldering it is possible to harvest pins from a dead cpu and put them in But if you don t want that route I would undervolt just to be safe
Damn wish we had those types of stores here in the UK
Why would someone even bother selling an item for 3 just throw it in the trash
You have nothing to lose If you're backing up your system and it craps 're back in business
Sure but also buy a fire extinguisher
Bargain of the century right here Did you get a good deal I THINK SOO beaming face with smiling eyes
At 3 if this thing works with no crashes errors I would be more than happy
thats wild what a jackpot find
Absolutely yes it's just VSS or called Ground pin You can heavily Overclock without a problem at all since it will redirect other ground pins instead Not recommended to use it if other than VSS pin went missing which can crash the system when under load
I thought the right of the two pins seen from central of chip is needed but cant find a great source Found this thought
I wish I was there in person so I could shout LETS GOOO In exactly the obnoxious way you are imagining In the immortal words of that one redneck dude send it
Yeah I'd say 5 hours of Prime 95 stress testing is a pass If it would've failed via power or anything else it would've by then It'll be far less stressed in everyday and gaming workloads And if it does die Well it was 3 rolling on the floor laughing
safe sure if you're patient enough to bend the pins and lucky enough to get the broken ones soldered in I'd risk it am4 motherboards are cheap but I doubt you'd mess one up at most you'd ruin the cpu and waste some time
I would run it
That's an absolutely amazing find Soldering pins is not hard provided you have the right tools
Here is the video the 3 ryzen 9 5900x part 2 video utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 utm source share utm medium web2x context 3
Repair it At least try it Its just 3 U need to replace the two missing pins The rest u might be able to bent it back
What have you got to lose it was 3 If it pops you need to buy a new one if you throw it in the bin you need to buy a new one
That's amazing but not sure how safe it is to run Might crash but it shouldn't burn down your house
woah even its broken broken i'll buy it for 3 USD use it as keychain
Dude literally hit the jackpot
For 3 bucks you haven't got much to lose just don't OC as others mentioned
Amazon outlets are amazing I got downvoted to fucking hell for stating my buddy went to town at one and got lucky that everything he bought works
Amazing deal Great to hear that it also runs well I shouldn't be too worried about safety tbf You can solder new old pins on it if you wanted to
Should be OK with an undervolt
I'm jealous of you OP and I live in Hawaii
Is there a UK based equivalent of this store sounds awesome
Your mobo won't burn if it runs it runs
You will live
Op I have experience with CPUs and electrical knowledge Use it enjoy it Feel free to overclock actually You will never have any issues with two missing vss pins Safe and will work fine
Non technical answer Use it there should be no problem Don't run PBO
This reminds me of the day I found a blendtec blender at a thrift store for 3 bucks I figured worst case I could take it apart and see what made it tick It's 3 years later and makes a smoothie every morning
well maybe the cost to fix is too expensive I saw a shop on youtube he charges 20 or 50 for each pin
I think you can get those pins soldered at a reasonable price too because you've already fixed the bent pins yourself you might have to mail it
I ran an 8350 with straightened pins for 7 years You'll be fine Edit i missed the missing pin Could stick a pin in the socket hole for it i suppose
Well if it stressed for 5 hours is safe but two missing pins might mean memory connection severed or pcie connection severed you would need to test it as a full machine for some time to see what you lost I would say go ahead test it for one week and if it has everything you need use it as a daily driver I wish I could grab those bargains I would be all over it
Without overclock I not see the problem And the price it's so good
just undervolt it
I mean I'll use it as my daily driver if you don't want it haha I'll pay you double what you paid for it Heck I'd pay you 10x what you paid beaming face with smiling eyes
Good for you
If in doubt sell it on Ebay as pre owned and buy a new one
You could try to solder those pins back Athlon cpus are like 10 on ebay that you can use to practice soldering
u bogertonn Some people are telling OP to undervolt the CPU because these 3 fewer pins means the load will be higher on other pins Correct me if I'm wrong but that sounds kinda like the opposite of what makes sense The higher the voltage the lower the amperage needed to supply a certain amount of energy So for example for a constant power draw of 100W you can obtain it like 100V x 1A 100W 50V x 2A Or even 200V x 0 5A In other words if OP undervolts their CPU wouldn't the current increase That being said overvolting doesn't seem like a good idea to me for 2 reason 1 This CPU is faulty It works but it has a defect Overvolting is not good for a healthy CPU core that applies here too but might be worse because of the defect 2 Someone mentioned the missing bins are related to voltage that might create problems too For me the logical way for OP to be on the safe side with this CPU under clock the CPU instead of messing with the voltage That way the power draw in general will go down voltage and current too taking off any extra stress imagined or real generate because of the missing pins
I would say do NOT overclock that thing Probably set a power limit or something I imagine it would be fine missing a couple VSS pins but if it requests too much amperage the other VSS might not be able to compensate
THIS WAS PROBABLY MINE LMAOOOO
Best thing about these stores is if you buy something nonfunctional or is missing pieces you can just order a new one off Amazon and send the defective one back for a refund
Does anyone know if there's any places like that close in your fort Lauderdale
gif emote free emotes pack facepalm
Get yourself a scrap CPU and put some pins in the socket to restore the missing ones
Use it if it doesn't work what's the worst that can happen yolo
Flawless victory
You may use it
VSS pins are connected in parallel inside the chip so it should be fine as long as you don't overclock it which shouldn't be necessary anyway Have Fun with your new Chip Edit Even if the chip dies it was only 3 bucks and you could always get another AM4 chip
Looks like the solder pad is still there to make contact Got any older PGA AMD CPUs laying around Break the needed pins off and then place them in the socket hole and install the cpu Seen Linus do this in the past
How did you straighten them
THREE DOLLARS
Nah its not safe i'll take it off you for 4 tho
Tbh yes it will work fine I had an old fx8350 that had 2 missing pins so to make sure I bought pins off eBay and put them in the correct holes in socket and that made a connection I sold it that way with the mb and made sure the owner knew this but worked perfectly fine Some pins aren't needed but make sure it doesn't effect dual channel memory
Yes
That is the cool thing of this CPUs its possible to fix them if you are brave enough
If it works it works
and i just want a working
I once bent 3 rows of pins in my 3700X when trying to change the thermal paste in it to install an watercooler on my gaming PC turns out the shop that assembled it a year ago put some horrible termal paste or maybe it was the one that came with the Wraith Prism but it pretty much turned into a glue and made the processor and copper coils into one and was terribly hard to peel it off had to pull it off with an screw and an heat gun I know its dumb and its obvious that the processor would fly away and its exactly what happened 3 full rows of pins bended and some others too Luckily my gf was helping me and managed to bend them back into place so I put the processor back in booted normally and 8 months later had no problem at all Turns out there are some pins that are not essential are redundant or is for security reasons such as grounding An bent or missing pin is not an necessary inta death of the processor so you should be all fine with him on as your main PC too since you already stress tested him
same thing my lady did on her 3600X bent pins AND broke one off well it ran for a year using only 1 RAM slot no problem and now its still used a small home server D
I accidentally bent a pin on my old FX 4100 years ago I bent it back with mini pliars easy peezy and it's still running fine today 10 years straight Never knew it was a big deal Lol
I probably wouldnt run that but thats just me
I would avoid over clocking or in general doing anything that ll really push your rig but otherwise it should be fine
Should be fine if you ran prime 95 for 5 HOURS
This is an awesome find congrats Idk the answer to your question but I'm sure others do My thoughs are maybe find a shop that can solder the pins back for you I'm sure it wouldn't be too expensive for a shop that does that type of work
Is there one of these in Melbourne Australia
Probably safe ran a ryzen with 4 bent pins lost two fixing them never crashed
I think the missing pins dont really matter that much so i thing your are good to go on your daily system of you are willing to its your choise
absolutely not safe give it to me instead i will get rid of it safely Should be fine those two pins are likely voltage related theres enough other voltage pins that you should be good
I would undervolt it at least some While the chips are slightly overbuilt to handle it the electricity and heat from it is now spread over fewer pins Losing a few wont hurt it too badly but you lost dome buffer headroom undervolt should compensate
Just buy one off actual Amazon and do an Amazon swap
Wow I wish we had placed like this in the UK loudly crying face
I wouldn't could go at anytime
Amazon returns are a gold mine every now and then My girlfriends mom buys pallets of returned Amazon stuff and so far I ve gotten a free 1TB WD Black M 2 a free 1080p curved monitor a nice ass USB hub and a couple hard drives She also managed to pull a fully operational Samsung Z flip or whatever and she sold that thing for like 800
good job there the universe smiled at you
It's easy if you want to repair Contact northridgefix
Forget the bent pins Even under worst case loading scenarios the current increase through the remaining pins will be negligible The fact that those pins are missing will not alter the operation of the chip to any degree that would be detectable outside lab
A fairly simple fix for this I have used a few times with AM2 CPUs is to strip some AWG 24 copper wire old school phone wire and cut pieces slightly longer than the actual pins I am pretty sure that was the gauge but you will know on the next step based on whether they fit I put them in the holes of the missing pins and then installed the CPU I sometimes had to try a few lengths but I could always get it to work mine were typically a POST No POST scenario I used at least one of the CPUs in more than one motherboard
I'll buy it from you for 6 100 ROI
Just solder some vss pins on After all it was 3 dollars
Fixing previously working equipment is a great feeling
VSS is fine
Where are these Amazon return stores you all are talking about
That is awesome great work You're not at a loss no matter what you do with it
Take your well earned place in Internet Mythology my friend
Nice fairytale lol face with tears of joygrinning face with sweat
I dropped my 5900X and had this happen After hours or trial and error i was able to straighten all the pins with a plastic razor blade I luckily only lost two pins that affected my memory controller only working with channel A1 A2 Good luck and be patient
Someone tell me how do you find one of these stores
Absolutely nothing wrong with that at all my dude great buy congrats
Should be good just don't overclock very much
Yep depends on what the pin was for but given it s running and passing probably good I bent the hell out of my 3700x and lost a pin It still works Took a couple hours with a insurance card and a needle but worth it
Shh my niece s computer has 5 Corsair Vengeance RAM an 8 Rosewill power supply and 16 SP140 and SP120 RGB case fans from pallet resellers
Bro I broke 2 pins off my 5950x and I've lost a1 a2 ram slot no more dual channel still works 3 and it turns on U scored big
Totally unsafe and needs to be properly disposed 'll give you an address that you can ship it to and help you pay for the cost
Some guy bought a 13 something i something Intel processor for 2 99 at a thrift shop recently
What a deal Could always find a donor CPU remove the pins and microsolder it on to the 5900x Of course that's easier said than done
Send her bud Nice find
My 2700x is in way worse condition missing 5 pins 3 Vss and two Vdd and is running fine about 4 years pretty heavily overclocked
I legit have one 5900x with bent pins I don t know what to do with it I think about 2 broken pins and 5 10 bent pins I kept the pins if it matters It s just collecting dust right now Any ideas
That's a steal of a deal Kudos on putting in the work to save this chip from the electric chipper of doom
Fantastic find There is no problem whatsoever with running a CPU that has 2 missing power pins There are a LOT of those and they are all in parallel anyway The CPU would probably still work even if you had 20 missing power pins The worst case scenario is that the CPU has very slightly less overclocking potential due to the increased resistance between the VRM and the silicon
100 use it as a daily Maybe under volt it a little Worst that can happen is it crashes So keep data saved if its important Other than that fuck it
Been running a 5600x with a missing VSS pin for over a year now Absolutely no issues Have fun
Huge W
Consult a professional to soldier on those missing pins if possible Then you would really have something Not sure if possible or not but could work read up on it
Big score Congrats
In ryzen the VSS pins are bridged so the vss output is performing through the other vss pins that you still have There is no problem in using it
If you still want to get those pins fixed you can check NorthridgeFix
Are there any trusted English liquidation companies comparable to the one OP is talking about
You could buy a broken ryzen CPU and use those pins to solder it back on the 5900X
Of course it safe What do you think will happen Blow up your computer
Wow Good job
Well if the pads on those missing VSS pins are still there you can still solder some donor pins taken from older CPUs in their 3 for such an amount of power it's
A 5900x is still a top tier processor Might want to run it slightly undervolted just to be sure PBO2 lets you do that easily What a fucking score Congrats
I saw a guy on youtube replace these pins in a cpu He borrowed the pins from a donor cpu and soldered them in I am sure it is tedious work with some risk but it appears that they can indeed be replaced sometimes
Nice save
Reminder to check my local Dollar Tree store for CPUs lol
Here's the process for soldering new pins on t 140 t 140
use pbo and undervolt it to the max stable at stock frequency and you will be fine Congrats
Be altruistic buy a new 5900x from Amazon and return that one so someone else can get a 3 CPU
Yes for VSS pins some of them are back up pins some of them do nothing at all looks like you got lucky It might not overclock well tho but it is a 5900x
Hmm how about cutting 2 pins off an older CPU putting them in the existing holes on the mboard and then attaching the cpu The pins would likely make contact with the borked contacts on the cpu due to compression You might have to add a tiny bit of solder to the 2 cpu contacts to raise it ever so slightly But honestly if it's working now don't bother Congrats
For 3 run it until the wheels fall off
So for broken and missing pins You can use a small pieces of solid core copper wire about the same size as the pin and drop it into the motherboard socket so it will make contact with the CPU when it's dropped in I dropped a CPU once and this saved me and worked for many years Even with lots of overclocking and the computer wouldn't even boot prior to the fix
You can shop directly on Amazon Warehouse search for Amazon Warehouse deals but they typically don't sell broken products like these so you won't get these types of discounts On the plus side they are sold by Amazon and backed by their return policy so it's pretty safe and I've never had an issue with returns For deals like OP you'll probably need to go through a liquidation company search for Amazon return liquidations However those typically only sell pallets where most of the contents are junk you don't need My guess is that the store that OP went to buys the pallets and re sells the individual items If you're interested in Amazon Warehouse deals I built a site Dealforager for browsing their best deals
The company BidFTA has locations spread across a decent footprint I'm sure I will regret sharing this as I bid against you people but oh well
Liquidation stores This was a topic on Reddit a few months ago It s pretty much flavor of the day with the pallet from Amazon I say 1 of this happening again
I want to know too
Not totally related but I've seen youtube channels where people buy entire mystery pallets of amazon returns and make yt videos of unboxing the pallet They turn around and sell on ebay You can find some pretty good deals just hard to target a specific item
There's one near me It's mostly trash
There's a couple like that
There are local auctions all over that sell amazon home depot costco etc returns They buy returns by the pallet break them down and sell individually Be careful you don't bid more than what they're actually worth on sale though It's very easy to do so because auctions won't show their fee taxes 20 total that's added after the bidding is complete
Just look up bin store and see if they're any in your area They typically will sell all items for x dollars each depending on what day it is for price Like Friday with all new inventory might be 10 then 8 Saturday 6 Sunday 5 Monday 3 Tuesday and 1 an item on Wednesday
Correct I'd also say don't overclock the chip because of this
Just a heads up but I've owned two 5900x's and two 5950x's and both of the 5950's drew less power during fully threaded PBO On workloads than the two 5900's I do not remember how the current compared but I imagine the voltages on the cores were slightly higher and the power was slightly higher making the current about the same I have heard that this is a common phenomenon because of how 5950x's must have highly binned ccd's x 2 vs a 5900x often having one trash ccd with the worst 4 cores scrapped So in conclusion I don't know if it matters but you might want to consider that 5900x' often draw more power during full PBO loads due to core inefficiencies generally requiring them to run at higher voltages than in a 5950x Using Watt's law I believe this means that in order to have a higher power draw with higher voltage there must be equal ish current How that relates to missing certain pins I do not know Maybe you can help explain or calculate if it's an issue
Thanks for the information
Usually CMOS including CPUs uses NMOS nomenclature since it's been common for decades so VSS is the negative power rail usually ground S source pin on a FET VDD is the positive power rail D drain pin on a FET BJT nomenclature is still around too VEE is negative rail emitter and VCC is positive rail collector
I was thinking a lot of the pins are voltage pins If the removed pins are voltage pins it should still work fine with the exception of the area where the voltage is provided to In most cases you can still use the cpu quite safely in eco mode Up or under with PBO enabled But you probably don't want to do serious overclocking on these cpus without all the voltage pins present
FWIW 5950X and 5900X have the same TDP 105 W and PPT max power draw at 142 W so they draw the same amount of current Doesn't change your point in the slightest though
I second this The CPU will likely have a harder time with power draw and thus temps But I see no reason why you shouldn't run it Like ptrd said it was 3 not like you're losing all your money
I'd worry if it was a safety hazard but it totally might not be I don't know anything about it
Thanks I will post a YouTube video if anyone is interested
If it's just a power pin then you'll be fine since the 3200G isn't very power hungry
Conclusion CPUs are like cats
I am DYING over this comment rn
This is my recommendation
Soldering something that small is beyond the capability of most people and you risk damaging it Unless you're confident in your skills I would recommend against this Granted I'm old so if there's a brain dead way to do this that I'm unaware of I'd love to hear it
Did this to a 3600 I had and it works perfectly to this day Definitely the best course of action here
How did you bend them back
Get an audio interface and then you will have multiple audio outputs you can easily swap between via physical dials Also you could save a lot on a good mic because you would not need a USB powered one and just plug it in via XLR Aaaaand in extra you could also run higher impedance headphones You can get a scarlet solo for pretty cheap especially used
Having to run single channel ram isn t the end of the world but it s not optimal
Losing a memory channel will mean you're only getting 50 memory bandwidth but the impact of that in terms of real world performance really depends on what you're actually doing You may not even notice
Same thing happened with me when I was upgrading my CPU fan Somehow missed the info about how stuck on they get and after prying it off it went flying Some pins bent and 1 or 2 came off when I tried to bend it back Now it boots but will only POST when use half of my RAM Keep looking for a crazy AMD deal so I can use my system to it's full potential
Why does the cpu have HD audio pins Surely that's all done on the chipset
I just checked and you are right I assume it's ok to run it without those pins right
It scored 111 on UserBench Temps are acceptable Damn what a steal You could've easily sell it for profit in the original damaged state not to mention now If you want to keep it make sure that not just the CPU but also RAM work as intended Do some benchmarks gaming and monitor the system and as someone else said if it works it works
It seems fine with my watercooling 50c idle and 70c under load
It was one of those stores with the huge bins of items they get new stock on Friday and it starts around 10 and each day the price goes down a dollar until everything is gone This was the find of the century
Customers returns thousands of items if you get like 5 each you're recouping kind of a lot
Why toss usable objects in the trash It'd be very wasteful if this CPU had ended up in a landfill instead of OP's PC
3 is a McDouble and small fries from McDonald s
A lot of people buy used return pallets Say this was a box of 40 CPUs for 100 3 is the happy medium for people to buy as is Any more and they won t take the risk If they sell all 40 for 3 they just made 20 on just that lot
And insurance And a backup PC And new batteries for your smoke detectors JK I'm sure it'll be just fine
Her is a good resource
I have a video
It works
The missing pins are ground pins of which there are others Hence why it works just fine
Apparently it's the Azalia HD Audio pin I'm not sure if that would cause any issues
I just re checked the pinout and it's actually Azalia HD Audio pins so the only thing I lost is audio
usually power usage scales with voltage so lowering voltage should lower current as well
I bought one and it ended up shipped destroyed as hell so I sent it back
Using a razor blade
I checked out your website and I know data quality problems are hard to solve but there were some amusing deals A 57 beer glass that was 97 off raised some eyebrows and the original listing was claiming a price of 2500 There was a mid range Canon lens that was selling for 972 but listed as 97 off too with a list price of 35 000 These kinds of issues make the website hard to use but yeah I understand the difficulty in preventing it from happening
I've been using your site for quite some time and it's got me some great deals on records Thanks for making and maintaining such an awesome resource
r usernamechecksout
Tells you how bad Amazon's search is when it's better to use a secondary site to find things
I have seen a 6700 XT for like 275 in Good condition on there before and debated buying it but wasn't sure about the return hassle if it had problems with the fans or something
I've got one of those pallet selling places a block from my house Not a single sign on the building either Really weird and creepy
Does this site run on the Aussie Amazon too and or can it
Oh They'll sell literal garbage and then argue with you about it I ordered a projector screen that was crushed into a u shape and they marked it as acceptable condition
Don t give it away face with tears of joy got a 600 office chair from Steelcase on there for 90 due to cosmetic imperfections That place is awesome if you re willing to deal with a dud every now and then
Do they ship internationally
Any of my German fellows got anything comparable
Nice There's one within 10 minutes of my house
BidFTA eh they're not even an option in my state so you're good lol
Damn it got my hopes up no locations near me Hate my state

Is there even any point to overclocking anymore Like back in the day with the Q6600 or I7 920 you got MASSIVE gains from easy overclocks and it was stable I tried overclocking with the 1800x when I had it and some other chips and I got hardly any gains at all and with massive instability Partially because the 'turbo' mode on these chips is already doing it for me it seems
So undervolt it perhaps Just fiy I understood nothing from the comment
Honestly it ll probably still work fine probably best not to push it beyond a pbo undervolt
If I only paid 3 I'd overclock it as hard as I can
Isn't the 5900X 6 6 Never heard of it being 8 4 tho the binning quality statement still stands either way
You'll end up with more current over fewer pins most likely Given what x570 and B550 platforms can deliver in PBO that would be mildly concerning as in melted AM4 socket and or substrate interconnect zappage I probably wouldn't put that CPU into a mongo bucks x570 board but I'd happily slap it in my B550 test box especially since the CPU was THREE DOLLARS Or more likely I'd actually get out my hotair station clip a few pins off an old PGA celeron they use the same size pins and actually attempt to repair the
It's correct however it's also fairly easy to limit power draw You don't even need to be an expert at it You can just run it in eco mode and manually set the eco mode from 65W to 105W or anywhere between and your power draw will decrease In my case running between eco and pbo didn't result in that much performance loss but it did return about 50W less power draw
Reviews confirm your finding IIRC
Read the reply to his comment the 5950X in reality draws a very similar amount of power to the 5900X due to binning
Someone ELI5 please why the chip still works with missing pins What are voltage pins apparently they have some redundancy to them So more current is now flowing through the remaining voltage pins
Temps max at around 80 under extreme conditions but I have watercooling
If i understand electrical engineering correctly a damaged power line would perform even better on higher voltage I also think that undervolting would not affect amperage whatsoever or would it draw less
Not really It s not very likely to cause a catastrophic failure like a fire and the worst it would likely do is fail and maybe take out a motherboard or more likely a PSU Both of those have safety measures if the CPU flatlines so they d likely be fine too Missing pins or poor contact is much more likely to cause instability with a form of OC than to have a catastrophic event If I were in OPs shoes I m popping that5900x into my motherboard and keeping my 5800x as a backup or using it in a cheap build That s another 4 cores and more performance for 3
I wonder if heating them a little with a blow dryer would make them a little more ductile and less prone to snapping when straightening
I am if one day I will encounter that situation
Had to do the same after my cooler suctioned onto my 5800x and it was ripped out of the socket bending pins It was nerve racking but just using some cut up cards did the trick My socket was warped in a way that happened to caused the side with the formerly bent pins to stick out So I spent more time than required bending back pins
Wait a second frowning face with open mouthfrowning face with open mouth
Guys is my cat going to be okay under 1 8 vcore
What do you think the C stands for
Easy mode tip a phone repair tech some cash to do it I have a guy I've gotten buddy buddy with at a shop near my my house that I bring random items to from time to time
Yeah Jesus Christ Who could do that I don t have an electron microscope or a hand that steady Would bin the whole thing
I don't know if this is still good practice but back in the day you would use a heatgun and a mechanical pencil tip to slide over the pin and gently pry it back while it was warmed up to avoid breaking it while bending PGAs are probably too dense these days to use a mechanical pencil tip So perhaps a fine blade knife or electronics tweezers would do the trick Warming it up first is the key though doing it cold could risk it snapping
Yeah I broke the pins when I tried to remove the cooler to reapply thermal paste Damn ryzen stock paste was soo strong I ripped the CPU from the socket zz Using it like this for 2 years and its long while until I can upgrade
I didn't know about this I will change cpus on my machine soon so how do I avoid this problem while removing the cooler
Not for AM4 As CPUs have become more dense more chipset logic has become integrated on die for cost efficiency and performance The Northbridge chips were the first to be absorbed with integrated memory controllers and every subsequent generation saw increased integration of southbridge logic Specifically AM4 incorporated HD Audio Azalia USB DisplayPort some PCIe lanes and other IO on die The only audio chip that remains is the codec IC eg Realtek ALC1220 etc containing the DACs and ADCs that require physical separation noise isolation from the CPU
Internal audio codec shouldn't work utm source share utm medium android app utm name androidcss utm term 1 utm content share button
Where can you find those stores
I would live inside that store lol
Should I post the video I took
probably just 2 ground pins if it works now then those were prob redundant pins meaning just some of many in the line i wouldnt worry too much
Daily Dealz
Not even These days 3 won't include fries
Onboard sound Mobo might have an alternate
then Congratulations are in order
USB headset
I'm sure that's what happened here
Yes there are definitely issues in the extremes The reason is that I'm using the price that Amazon is showing me for the new version of the item which may or may not be accurate Amazon manages hundreds of millions of product listings so it's mostly done algorithmically Sometimes these algorithms or third party sellers do weird things like pricing beer glasses at 2K or cameras at 35K However in practice this is very rare and the prices are almost always accurate Once you narrow down the results with search the quality should be much better Just as an example this sub would understand a 7900xtx could be listed as new for 2K and sold by Amazon Warehouse for 950 how would I determine that this is not actually the real new price Now do that for millions of items
Thanks for leaving such a nice comment It really motivates me to hear from people who use my site
no joke I often shop for hardware on newegg first with their great filter search and when I find something I want I put the part name in google Amazon just to find Amazon's listing for
Same goes for Reddit's search as well I almost always use Google to find anything on Reddit xD
I don't recommend buying complex computer parts from Amazon Warehouse unless you're 100 ok with the hassle of testing it and returning it if it's faulty On the other hand I've never had an issue with returns I recently returned a Very Good condition motherboard that had bent pins with just a few clicks It's up to you to determine if it's worth the hassle for the savings In my case testing that motherboard wasted many hours and I wish I had just gotten it new I've had much better luck with simpler components like fans or coolers
I got Steelcase Think v2 for 20 with stains which were no match against Woolite Instant Stain remover and a wet dry vac My PCs are all TigerDirect Outlet and Amazon Warehouse YMMV not everyone willing to put in the work have the experience or patience to fix the occasional issues if any D
It used to be better I don't see stuff like that much anymore I did once get a 1600 BBQ once for 150 It arrived in its crate like any other new BBQ would
They don't ship at all You have to drive to the warehouse that has the item you bid on and pick it up in person
Dreial2419 on ebay
Yeah definitely would love some stores like that here The only one I can find is a b2b one that mostly sells by the literal truckload
Plus 11 other states
same here
Depends On your 1800x there's not much point but on my 1700 I can get it most of the way to the perf of your 1800x at a lot lower cost I would guess that's where the biggest gains are seen in matching higher spec chips rather than beating records on the daily
The 1800X is pretty close to the peak of what the Zen 1 architecture can achieve and that's an architecture which doesn't clock very high Thus the overclocking headroom is quite low My 3600 however is great to overclock I can get better than 3600XT performance out of a much cheaper chip
undervolt CO is not a problem especially if you lock in the PBO limits since those are expressed in Amps and Watts bottom line is less pins less conductors for carrying same amount of power each single pin will need to carry more technically those pins can be soldered back onto the pad but you would need someone like Louis Rossmann u bogertonn I would send over an D perhaps he will do a cool YT video out of your CPU
Changing the voltage doesn't do anything to the amperage I suppose Actually overvolting is even better for thin power lines' resistance which is why long distance power lines are 400000 volt vs home is 400 volt
As far as I know 5900X is always 6 6 One CCD is usually higher quality than the other though
You're very likely correct I don't even remember what the layout was and I just had that in the back of my head for some reason 6 6 makes more sense Although I will say that I also have some vague possibly a memory about interesting configurations due to supply issues their terrible pricing for 5800X initially Like no one wanted a 5800x for the launch price You could get a 5600x for like 150 less and a 5900X was only like 100 more The 5600x was better value than the 5800x if you were just gaming and if you needed to stream or multi task the 5900x had the big boy cache and significantly higher clock speeds Like the capability gap between the 5800x 5900x was huge while the gap between 5600x 5800x was minor But the prices deltas reflected the opposite So they couldn't really sell 5800x's like they were selling the other 3 I remember the 5800x being available for like 2 3 days on their digital river store when the other 3 would sell out within seconds to minutes
I had to do it once with a soldering iron on a 3700X Luckily it was on the corner edge Just another PSA Arctic MX 5 is super sticky and apparently legitimately like makes a suction cup bond if you try to remove it when it's not hot I was replacing a NH 15 with a Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280mm I've done this at least a hundred times across various sockets and arrays I twisted it to make sure the paste was broken free and it twisted fairly easily So I just pulled up on it Well up came the noctua cooler and CPU as one My 3700x left one of its outside corner pins in the socket lol
I didn't realize that Zen 3 CPU's had eco mode I'd only heard of it with the release of Zen 4
This is key just go Eco mode for 96 of the performance for 60 of the wattage amp requirement
1 They are the pins that supply power to the CPU through the socket as opposed to pins that are used for data such as communicating with the RAM PCI E devices etc 2 Sort of usually the pins that supply the power are run in parallel but 3 Yes more current will flow through the remaining pins which can cause problems in certain situations and as such you wouldn't want a damaged CPU like this in a rig you are doing a lot of over clocking on as an example
There's no risk to just running it until it dies lol It's a steal
LOL did you find an AIO at your store too you lucky duck
i did this to an old clawhammer after i dropped it with a full size heatsink on it bent about ten pins back never had a problem
I feel like that would just make them more susceptible to ripping off the solder pad Just a hunch
Unfortunately that wouldn't work You will weaken the solder a lot more than you will weaken the pins as the solder has a much lower melting point Then you risk removing the pins from the PCB
Doing some r catculations
still unlikely ive tried
Some good recommendations to prevent that 1 run a stressing tool like Prime95 to heat up the CPU and soften the thermal paste 2 Do turning movements gently when removing the cooler and it will unglue after some effort If there's room underneath the cooler try to hold down the locking lever in order to keep the socket from moving 3 someone once told me to succesfully use a plastic prying tool like those used to open laptops to lift the cooler though I have never tried this technique myself but sounds a pretty ingenuous idea as a last resort
Twist the cooler to break the 'seal' between the cooler and CPU and it will come off without any issue
That's OK I can use a PCIE sound card
50c idle isn't that bad anymore
My 5950x that is air cooled will sit at around 61C under full sustained load So 70C under load for water cooled isn't good RedOneMonster is right
At least the name of the store
My bad They got rid of the bundle lmao Still will get ya a McDouble grinning face with sweat
I ve been there before where I had to find some dollars to just get a partial meal so I appreciate every dollar and still pick up every penny I find Now I m buying over priced gpus two years in a row I ll throw away money buying stuff but I won t throw it in the trash grinning face with sweat
Yeah I don't think I've ever been as mad as I was when I ordered an almost 400 dollar CPU for it to arrive with bent pins
Are you grabbing the current price from the item on Amazon I d be interested to see the Average Price over the lifetime or like past month of the item instead or as well This may provide more value for users
I don't buy any PC components worth more than 200 via Amazon as a personal rule after having an absolute nightmare trying to return a defective GPU It wasn't even a warehouse deal Edited for a typo
I didn't know Tiger were even still in business Haven't heard that name in ages
Ahh ok That sucks but is understandable Thanks anyways
That doesn't give me any results on eB
u 666phantom u kwell42 u johnnygfkys there is stores that sell amazon returns at constant price for example in Chicago there's a place called black Friday deals that gets shipments of returns on 1 day a week closed that day the next day you can buy anything for 7 the day after that anything for 2 0 5 so if you find a CPU in there it's always a good deal EDIT search black Friday deals Chicago and click the Facebook link
Same there
If its constant power then more voltage less current I dont really know what voltage change does to a cpu though
It does Amperage Voltage Resistance Increasing voltage should increase amperage all things being equal
6 6 would make more sense as they a probably get more 6 s than 4 s just statistically speaking and b want to put all their 8 s in higher margin products Plus it means schedulers don t have to think about what CPU gets what workload since they re the same
Arctic MX 5 Note I can confirm that Arctic MX 5 will create a bond so strong that you will rip the CPU right out of its socket Rember gently twist to break the seal or sadness will ensue
It's not the paste it's the CPU design I lost count of how many times a Ryzen cooler has gotten stuck to the IHS yet I've not had it happen ever with any other series of CPU
I've got it on my cheap ASRock b550 maybe only certain mobo manufacturers used it before it was a standard feature hopefully
Eco mode goes back as far as the 2000 series cpus
Not exactly There is still opportunity cost here If OP takes the cautious approach and keeps the CPU from dying they won't have to replace it which would cost far more than 3
This is on the money I've been repairing AM4 chips for years resoldering snapped pins and heating the PCB makes the pads far easier to separate Do it at your peril once you've lost a pad it's game over They can be bent back even reliably even from 90 degrees with some practice and technique without serious fatigue however it doe take some know how and practice so if you ever mash an expensive CPU buy a few Optrons from ebay for a few each and practice Just dont use a fresh stanly blade and run it up and down between the pins whatever you do I've seen a good few nice chips where the owner has cut traces in the PCB between the pins rendering the CPU dead
Could perhaps use GPU's audio out via monitor if yours has headphone out
For being liquid cooled that's pretty high he should be seeing more like 35c
It's well within specs Running the CPU at 40 50 or 70 doesn't really make a huge difference Running it cooler is mostly for ease of mind Even though he uses an AiO his case seems pretty bad in terms of airflow so maybe that's why Modern CPU can also handle much higher temps without problems
In Canada not even the mcdouble expressionless face prices have gone up huge the last several years
Did you order it from Amazon Hopefully swap or return was easy I have read the horror stories of people ordering a 13900K to end up with random 9600K Then you have opposite lads online order one but get two 13700K
Might be that some of those prices are for large quantity Like 500 beer for example same HyperX 512MB DDR400 2 5 5 5 12 could sell for 50 or 100 but the other had two and other had one and parsing that from the text was hard and error prone
Interestingly enough I just found out that Micro Center is opening a location in Miami Funny thing is they chose the old Tiger Direct HQ location Note Towards the end of Tiger Direct selling PC parts via their catalogs and website they started shifting towards selling extended warrantees D
Sorry It's only Dreial
We need this in NYC
is there one in the netherlsnds
How can one find said stores
Where is this store I cant find when googling
Is there something like this in Connecticut
Where is Chicago
I always assumed employees picked through all the good stuff beforehand
the next day you can buy anything that the staff somehow totally missed as an item of any value the previous day
Technically increasing voltage increases temperature and therefore changes resistance Don't remember in which way
May I remind you that undervolting will reduce the Wattage consumed Or do you mean it increases resistance Throwing around some physical formulas isn't exactly explaining CPUs with dead socket pins
In Zen2 iirc CCXs were paired to make CCDs with a total of 8 cores they would disable 2 of them for the Ryzen 5 lineup 4 of them for the lower tier Ryzen 9 lineup With Zen3 they switched to 8 core CCDs I don't think they have two different layouts every processor has done multiple of 8 cores I remember reading about a guy who unlocked his 2 disabled cores on an x600
It's much easier if you heat up the cpu first Of course I didn't think of this or even consider that 2 3 month old paste would form molecular bonds between my heat sink and the CPU's IHS So yeah run a few minutes of Cinebench and immediately shut down your computer next time you have to do battle with mx 5 I bought a big tube of MX 6 the day I saw it available on Amazon Hopefully it's not epoxy in disguise like it's older cousin
And I've never had it happen to any cpu that didn't have a cooler mounted to it for several years except for that one time with mx 5 And I've removed coolers from ryzen cpu's at least 2 3 dozen times So one of four possibilities exist I've been incredibly lucky you've been incredibly unlucky your counting and memory sucks or you've dismounted so many coolers that keeping count of the stuck ryzen coolers even if their stick rate is low was hard to keep count
Thank you for educating me I wonder how I missed seeing it with all the time I spent in gigabyte and msi's BIOS menus tweaking ram and cpu performance
OP gets a 3 broken CPU and a free financial class
Sell it 5 years later for 5 Baby you got a stew going
i love seeing someone finally thinking of opportunity costs
I ordered it off Amazon yes I re ordered it after I sent it back and the other one came fine
The last time I heard that name here in Canada was when they had commercials on a kids TV channel a good 20 years ago
Agreed
Thia type of business is probably everywhere Bindrop has a few locations near me
There is a place like this in Astoria Queens Up North by the powerplant
we gaan dit koloniseren makker
Via MyUs kan je voor 60 per jaar items laten reshippen en dus bestellen bij Amerikaanse winkels die normaliter niet buiten de VS leveren Als je ineens een videokaart vindt wellicht de moeite waard Retourneren kan toch niet
well if you're asking where Chicago is its probably not close by P Chicago City Illinois United States
On a map
Broadway
That's assuming the employees have extensive knowledge of every type of product on amazon and every employee sees every product across dozens and dozens of pallets
I'd say the effect of that is likely to be almost negligible Edit temperature increase leads to resistance increase factor dependent on material
There's nothing much in this entire post worth of comments explains cpus with dead socket pins A handful of lifeboats in an ocean of waves
I've had the issue with 3 different pastes on at least 5 different coolers including both air towers and AIOs
Considering that the 5900X is one of the best options for the AM4 platform upgrade path with the 5950X and 5800X3D taking the crown it'll likely retain a good portion of its value for a few years The i7 6700K fetched for about 300 at its peak back in 2019 2020 while the i7 7700K went for over 330 For context at that time you could sell a Z270 board and the 7700K to then buy a new board and a Ryzen 3700X 3900X or i5 9600K i7 9700K
Good stuff
As Seen On TV PC I worked the call center during that which was at the same address 2nd floor Good memories Either way can't wait It will be great to have a proper open to the public Computer store with decent options for Pc building components locally
Do you know the name of it by any chance
Helemaal mee eens Ik kan wel een nieuwe videokaart gebruiken Ik heb nu de rx 5500 xt
Gekoloniseert Any chance you would split some of the loot met de moffen D

Welp I just looked it up and it's now permanently
heb zelf een rx 580 kan ook wel een nieuwe gebruike
Well if you promise you bomb urk instead next time
Depends if you can pull the same party trick you guys did with rotterdam above altered we have a deal s
voor deze keer dan maar
Dat valt nog mee Ik heb een vriend met een i7 en een 512mb gpu
Ha das nog niks Ik heb een ryzen 7 met een gtx550ti
What D
voor deze keer dan maar Dankjuwell
Ik heb een laptop met intel integrated uit 2012 Het word niet beter
ik heb medelijden ik heb ook een ryzen 7 5800x maar met een rx 5500 xt
hiervoor had ik een hd 5770 uit maar veel meer dan minecraft wou hij niet haha kon wel met shaders spelen dus zo slecht was het ook niet
germany destroyed rotterdam in ww2 i think thats what he means
geen enkel probleem ik vind dat je trouwens best goed nederlands spreekt Beter dan mijn duits haha
Ik heb een ryzen 7 5700X met een rx 5700 und spreche kaum niederl ndisch verstehe die Unterhaltung jedoch trotzdem
Ah Well Since I'm against bombing anyone that should be fine
Hahaha dankjuwell Ik kan nederlands verstaan But my written dutch is not that good I won't even try to speak D x200B Also it's a shame that i didn't learn it in school since i grew up in northwest germany some 15 km from the border D
Well I live in east of the Netherlands Twente and I get German at school It's just not my best subject
At least you have the option or the obligation Unfortunately i couldn't even choose to take dutch
i didnt choose i got forced to learn it
Lol that comment about building an ultimate death PC by combining the exploding motherboard BIOS with the 7800X3D the 4090 with improperly inserted cable and the Gigabyte PSU that explodes when overloaded The ultimate nightmare build
I mid way through the video and glancing over at my 7800X3D and Asus X670E Hero HWMonitor is reporting 1 25V for SOC I updated my BIOS to the second latest I noticed a new BETA BIOS released yesterday but I m going to wait until that s out of BETA I think I dodged this issue fingers crossed I only ran the chip on the older bios for a week Still very disappointed at the whole situation and if my CPU fails months from now I ll always wonder if it was slowly being cooked in that first week when I got it before the BIOS update became public
asus wtf
Imagine if we didn't have people like Steve doing this kind of work Companies would have free reign for consistently poor quality control
so for the user basically just make sure bios is up to date and keep an eye on SOC and make sure its not too high or just not use expo at all and wait until bios updates become more stable am I getting that right does anyone want to correct me just trying to make sure since I'm building two pcs with 7000 series cpus in a week or so
Who else is watching this on their Ryzen 7000 system running a beta BIOS Oh it would be the ultimate irony
Asus just used to be the go to now it's just problem after problem For those who dare sounds like a threat now lmao
Looking back over the video and at vendor responses given previously I can't help but read all this as really shady and unethical behavior from all of these companies Each of them more or less kinda pawned it off as overclocking or cooling related at some stage implying on some level it's related to user error We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads AMD To support EXPO and or memory overclocking at DDR5 6000 and beyond SoC voltage has to be sufficiently increased to ensure compatibility and stability Asus As confirmed with AMD any intentional manipulation of these settings can damage the processor socket and motherboard Asus AMD EXPO technology can be used to optimize memory performance by appropriately increasing the CPU SoC voltage to ensure system stability when operating at higher memory frequencies MSI Everyone kiiinda soooorta admitted it was related to excess SOC voltages but didn't really own the fact that they're the ones who caused those excessive voltages or that it was done deliberately That part wasn't a bug they chose to do it That creates a funny problem If memory DDR5 6000 functions at 1 3v SOC or less then it validates GN's statements that EXPO shouldn't be messing with SOC at all and establishes the above statements as outright lies If DDR5 6000 now ceases to function on a bunch of these boards then all of them have been falsely advertising speeds they can't support And at the end of all that it's not even the whole issue They look even worse once you look the overarching issue especially in relation to OCP and PROCHOT No one's faultless here and Intel's pulled their own share of insidious crap over the years but this leaves a really bad taste in my mouth about AMD and Asus in particular Multi billion dollar companies with thousands of employees but it takes a comparatively tiny operation on friggin' YouTube to sink a week plus and thousands of bucks into it for people to get honesty That's so messed up but appreciated
Paying 700 for a MOBO only to have OCP not trigger when the socket is trying to feed a CPU 440W bro even the FX 9590 didnt use 440W who in their right mind thought a CPU needs 400W of power especially a CPU with a TDP of 120 180W Engineers at ASUS thought everyone got that liquid nitrogen coolingloudly crying faceloudly crying faceloudly crying face
This was a great video After watching it the take away I get is that this isn't specifically a buggy first generation EXPO implementation rather its a complex series of bugs around internal voltages failed safeties poor guidance from AMD and extra sloppy firmware support from motherboard manufacturers All of this is clearly very bad but it isn't the worst kind of bad This could have been a failed socket standard or failed chipset at the hardware level as in an irreparable problem requiring at best a lot of RMAs and at worse a lot of AM5 purchasers looking to buy last generation AM4 systems or speccing out new Intel systems Instead this looks like its something that can be overcome with firmware updates Too bad it happened and too bad none of this was caught by AMD or the motherboard manufacturers before any of the list of bugs and flaws made it to retail Glad it can be fixed I know its too much to hope but maybe AMD and the motherboard manufacturers could learn a lesson about doing something right the first time to at the very least save the cost of having to do it over if not at the very most to protect one's reputation for competence As for me I'll be installing BIOS 1414 Beta on my ASUS ROG Strix B650E F Gaming WiFi now
I'm on a MSI X670E Tomahawk with a 7800X3D and on a BIOS released 2023 04 14 it's pulled my SoC was running at 1 36v Updated to the latest yesterday and it's at the capped 1 30v Steve mentioned ideally it would be at 1 25v or presumably lower so I've manually set mine to 1 25v for now I'm using the CL30 DDR5 6000 G Skill Trident kit F5 6000J3038F16GX2 TZ5N I'll do some testing tomorrow for stability and update if things go haywire Fortunately I was only on that BIOS for about a day and a half and my temps were always fine but it's still a bit annoying that this ever made it to release Edit Some people suggested going down to 1 20v for SoC so I did that this morning So far so good Final Edit Been a few days now still perfectly stable at 1 20v
Gamers are beta testing not only AAA titles for a high price but components as well gif emote free emotes pack thinking face hmm
Sorry to be a pain but after watching the video I'm still not super clear about WHICH SOC voltage readout on hwdinfo is the one i need nor what would be a good setting I set it to 1 25V in the bios but will that include under load I'm on a Gigabyte X670 Aorus Elite AX version F8 bios F8c is out but the AMD AGESA version listed on the page is 1 0 0 6 not 1 0 0 7 listed as the fixed version elsewhere Should I hold off for that version And after that can I turn EXPO back on
Assuming you've been running your rig for a while now since launch without issues with these high SoC values for a few months would it then mean that your chip's lifespan has been effectively cut short Just wondering if my chip would effectively still fail in 1 2 years after flashing the new bios
well well ASUS soldering in fancy controllers and doing absolutely nothing with them User pays for it because everything is accounted in product price yet gets absolutely ZERO use of that It may may be just stupid prejudice but I'm not touch ASUS stuff ever since my Phenom II board died soon after warranty ended Maybe it's quite useful prejudice because stuff like this those non contacting coolings on GPUs and I'm sure I'm missing plenty more fuck ups but the worst part they kinda consider themselves most premium brand which ofc reflects in pricing especially ROG sub brand family of products
TLDW AMD fucked up Motherboard vendors fucked it up even worse But the TLDW doesn't do it full justice This is one of those videos that is really worth watching for the details
From my understanding this is the gist of it The issue is overall related to higher than normal SOC voltage slowly cooking the chip to a point where it develops a short This is dependent on the silicon lottery Some will cook sooner some will take time and some may not see any issues because their silicon is a champ Once the short develops none of the Over Current Protections appear to actually work and board keeps pumping current into the CPU w a short present until the smoke show Asus is more guilty of this as their OCP protections even additional protections they added to higher end boards don't do diddly squat AMD is also guilty because they're apparently asleep at the wheel AMD seems to be completely hands off in this process of motherboard vendors adhering to system specs Just like they are completely hands off on EXPO certification where vendors can test and do self certifications Why are they so disconnected considering they'll be the one that get plate full of shit to deal with like they are now At this point even if you lower the SOC voltage there is no guarantee that the slow cooking wasn't done to some level It's up to chance now Best of luck to all especially those early x3d adopters w Asus boards
I'm definitely upgrading to 5000 series thank you guys for beta testing 7000 maybe I'll get it in two years
Wait maybe I miss it cuz I m hella Sleepy already but what s the solution fix Just update bios finger cross it s fine and make sure soc voltage is cap to his recommended number
This will definitely be in the year end disappointment shirt
There are going to be a lot of users that don't keep up with the news or update their bios AMD and board partners should provide extended warranty coverage to users that are affected by these types of failures
So in regards to this entire situation we went from This is an ASUS problem to No this is a multiple motherboard to O but ASUS absolutely fucked up is the worst one out of all Lol fantastic Glad I returned my ASUS motherboard and went with a MSI B650 Tomahawk
30 40 EXPO in itself doesn't set SOC voltage Toggling EXPO may trigger a higher SOC voltage but that is on the motherboard manufacturer 32 21 Summary of their findings
He's confused RBMK reactor cores ASUS Motherboards don't explode
is hwinfo64 able to send alerts or make a popup notification to monitor any voltage or any threshold you can set to alarm on any sensor that would be very helpful in this dilemma specifically and would also help with monitoring in general
I just watched that Asus needs to get their shit together and AMD needs to lay down the hammer to vendors that use their technology There is no goddamn reason in 2023 a board should be forcing a chip to start after it has been damaged by overvolt
Keep in mind they doubled the mainboard prices with AM5 for lower quality boards than AM4 lmao
This is great for me since I have a 7800x3d aourus elite x670 and 6000 CL30 literally coming Monday for me to upgrade my PC Watching the video but any recommendations to avoid my PC from blowing up
So wait is buildzoids guide still safe then
Is there any motherboard manufacturer that was safer with their voltages or basically all of then screw up
I ve been running 7800x3d on X670 Gigabyte Aorus Elite XMP 6000 SoC has always been uner 1 245v This is my first move to AMD after decades of Intel Steve said we shouldn t all panic as it s an issue for only a small number of us I hate updating BIOS that are fresh off the presses Besides this nerve wracking potential threat it s been a capable chip for gaming I don t regret going 7800x3d
Steve is a role model If more humans were like him the wold would be a much better place
With the borderline adversarial communication between AMD and partners I d like to say that this is not a first either Elmore from Asus talked pretty freely on O d deliver buggy AGESA partners would patch around the bugs to get something they could ship AMD would churn the code and break the patches and cause new bugs etc Furthermore you d have cases like Vega where AMD would deliver incorrect specs in the technical packages mounting pressure change the physical specs during the production run without telling anyone undermolded vs overmolded and in fact got it wrong themselves even in reference cards as shown by GN at the time etc And then they did get it wrong again during rdna1 too asus probably wasn t making it up whole cloth that the mounting pressure in the package was wrong despite HUB s mockery at the time I don t see any evidence that wasn t actually the spec asus just committed the sin of not questioning it The other partners did potentially putting their customers at risk of cracking packages etc Plus a bit of incompetence of their own with some of theirs actually not being fully screwed in and being physically loose regardless etc a kind of similar situation to this with all parties involved being kind of incompetent But like people often have this idea that AMD does no wrong and the partners are just fuckups who use the wrong tension on their boards etc Nope a lot of the time AMD is the one who fucks up and sends out the wrong data to partners and they often add their own fuckups too And they both are kind of adversarial and working at their own ends too It s like a coworker you hate who keeps pushing broken stuff at you but you have no choice to work with them and hope they do a sorta competent job this week mostly Being broken but consistent is maybe better in some circumstances than trying to fix it and constantly breaking the fixes other people built around you Again just like this one there's usually plenty of blame to go around but I really get the impression AMD has been at least a contributing factor to the chaos a lot of the time Partners have some blame too but there's also often misinformation or bugs going out to partners or things that AMD could should have done to reduce the danger surface In this situation it is very curious that all the partners thought it was fine to use 1 5V and I wonder if that was what AMD originally told them the safe range was I know they all want Expo to be stable and are incentivized to go to whatever they think is stable but it doesn't seem to have been an objectively practically measured number either It's not helping anything much either actually in some cases it's high enough it can reduce stability so why did they all decide that going to 1 5v instead of 1 1 1 2v was a good thing if there's not really any practical circumstance it helps OK 1 1v is necessary 1 2v is good even with high clocks on a bad chip let's throw 1 3v at it just for safety
Boom Explosive coverage Love GN
Well it's sure a good thing I ponied up for the extended warranty on my mobo through Microcenter
Isnt the simple solution to run ram at 5600 stock til its resolved
AMD really needs to up their game in terms of quality The performance and efficiency is there but still way too many issues whether we are talking USB issues power issues or anything else And this applies across their product lines ie CPUs chipsets GPUs etc
So should I even get the Amd expo ram or not I wanna build my pc already have the 7800x3D in hand what mother board should I get asus rog strix x670 gaming e e or a msi one
I've been running at 1 4v soc since release last Sep Oops face with tears of joy oh well at least it was my own doing and not Asus deciding to do it for me
What should people do that have an asus board and an 7800x3d but not assembled yet Like me
I'm concerned with the issue with Gigabyte motherboards If they apply higher voltage than what's being reported how can I guarantee that my system is safe
Yeah I m just gonna go return my strix b650e e and 7800x3d and get the 13900k z790 Not worth it Just bought them last week too been waiting for my fans and aio to ship Return window will close by the time I can build since it s only 15 days for micro center Sad
Regardless of who's fault is this is Zen1 all over again This teaches a lesson Never buy a first gen of AMD CPU's when it switches platforms
Honestly AM5 is just a complete mess t 2020
The prices skyrocket while apparently oversight and quality disappear This is clearly a problem with both AMD and the motherboards neither bothers testing and neither knows as much about the products they sell as they want you to think they do
TLDR Avoid ASUS if you like your chips alive and unspoiled
7700X on a B650 Aorus Elite AX here HWInfo shows 1 249V max tested under load in gaming and Cinebench R23 So ok for now I guess Still running the original BIOS F1 which the board shipped with I know I as the system is running fine with EXPO enabled Hope I can wait to update until the new BIOS with AGESA ComboAM5 1 0 7 0 drops IgorsLab summarized the change log and there seem to be some important updates coming Don't want to update twice Do you think it would make sense to still limit VSOC to 1 25 even though HWInfo is giving ok values I'm a little paranoid after watching Steve's video that this might trigger a bug in my old BIOS which actually might make things worse
Thanks tech jesus
All you need to know 33 41 honestly this platform is a complete mess That's all folks Let's pack up and go home This whole thread mostly shits on Asus but that line that is the real news
Alright now it's time to go find all those people who dismissed this in any way being AMD's fault It was almost everyone here when this all happened at first But strangely enough they're no where to be found now
Have my nicely popped popcorn ready let's go
So basically this is a skip for the whole 7000 series for some time until we get a clear picture or the issues being fixed
ASUS MB 400W for the CPU please PSU Ummm ok
First time AMD CPU owner here Going to be real hesitant to go Team Red again after all of this Say what you will about Intel and their anti consumer behavior but I'm not aware of their chips blowing up
Well if my 7900x dies I'm just never going to buy an AMD product again
I really just should have gone with Intel for my new build Can t believe the chaos with the CPU s und boards right now I have the gigabyte 650 aorus elite ax too
AMD and Asus have a lot of explaining to do
thank you father steve
Asus has always had overvoltage issues in their boards I know this from first hand experience
But what is the conclusion on this What should we do as gamers
Man these guys are amazing in such a short span of time they came up with such an in depth analysis its been only around 72 hours or so since that guy shared his cpu getting toasted for no reason I am not a hardcore gamer nor enthusiast so I think I will stick to intel for my next build
Probably late but this will be a new entry to this years disappointment shirt
Now this has made me more confused about what medium range motherboard to get
Thanks for this video u lelldorianx and team for putting this together and getting it out there I'm on an MSI X670E Carbon Wifi with a 7950X3D with the latest BIOS Appears that the new BIOS is setting SoC at 1 30v I've lowered it to 1 2V and lowered my memory speed back down to 6000MT S from 6400MT S So far stable and don't expect it not to be to be honest I'll probably try to remember to keep setting it to that whenever I update my BIOS and luckily after AGESA 1 0 0 7 I don't really see there being a need to update further on the current AM5 platforms For the most part everything is stable over here and having proper 24GB 46GB module support would be nice maybe I'll think about upgrading my 2x16GB kit at some point when those come down in price a bit
Msi b650 edge with 7700x and gskill 6000 cl30 expo enabled Hwinfo indicated 1 355v SOC with latest bios Manually set SOC to 1 25v Hwinfo indicating SOC is in fact at 1 25v now I hope this doesn t affect stability Had an Asus b650e f before that was a clusterfuck of crashes and blue screens This msi b650 board has been rock solid so far
We might have to install fire suppression and sprinkler systems in our cases now gif emote free emotes pack joy
Sounds like this year's Disappointment PC build is going to be lit
5x more money 5x less protection My asus z87 deluxe still running 24 7 for near 10 years This hit needs to change
Welp this solidified my thoughts of avoiding Asus in the future
Warlock guy is everywhere
How much karma is AMD going to have to eat take before they get a break AMD tosses shade on the melting 12hvpwr adapters and their comeuppance is faulty reference coolers on launch day for Radeon RX 7900 and now this Woof
I finally decided to not be an Intel fanboy and give AMD a chance with the 7800x3d
Thanks to GN and everyone who helped GN
For these POS am5 motherboards they charged us exorbitant prices
ASUS
I'm still only 25 minutes into the video but now I'm having 2nd thoughts of getting AM5 for an upcoming
So much for those confidently predicting that the GN video would show it to have all been user error
Great Video But I think most people here overreact a bit Literally in the video you see a table when you don't turn on expo or xmp it all runs at a low voltage Even on the old BIOS they which is enough for MOST games you play to get awesome performance with a 7800x3D Just leave Expo out for some weeks let them tweak their BIOS and you gucci to turn it on again in June or so I still hope Asus fix the other issue with the 00 's for me a bigger fuckup to be honest
XMP and now EXPO pumping stupid voltages is nothing new gotta make sure it works for most so they bump them up to account for CPUs with weaker IMC etc Didn't seem to have as much unfortunate consequences though maybe in the long run but not that fast well I say as much but I have no idea how widespread the issue really is
So basically all motherboards are affected more or less Asus is the worst but even Gigabyte has a bug in which their motherboards can feed 1 4V SOC by accident
This is terrible I really wanted to build an AM5 system but seeing all this stuff regarding CPU being burned having issues is a let down
Has anyone passed this video to
Asus was great now it's just a joke a bad joke

Just finished the GN video I got the AM5 platform and went with Asus because of their rep and longevity will honestly go back to Intel now for future builds I can t believe AMD Asus would fuck this up so badly
Welp this is the last straw for me Wanted to give AMD a chance but the day my 7800X3D arrived I found out about the explosion fiasco I left it in original packaging just in case until more is found out about this issue but its pretty clear that AM5 is mightily flawed Returning both cpu and mobo next week and getting myself an ever reliable intel build
The one time I decide to spend extra for an ASUS board and then this fiasco hits Never again should have gone for the cheaper ASROCK board gif emote free emotes pack thumbs down
What did they burn 2 cpus and 2 motherboards in the testing
Ironically I think maybe I dodged a bullet by going for a cheaper Asus board I've never seen these high VOC voltages even on earlier bioses
The only YouTube channel I've bought merch from No regrets Thanks for putting in the long hours Steve Can't wait for resolution
I wish I understood this stuff It sounds interesting Has anyone put together an ELI5
The interesting part to me is why does the iGPU inside the SOC runs on vcore It's such a low wattage component why send vcore back to the SOC Makes 0 sense to me
I had an EVGA 980 Ti that burst into flames one day randomly I had it RMA'd wish I knew back then Gamer Nexus would've bought it off of me to examine and share with everyone
AMD and Asus should be doing that
So if i'm gathering this correctly the issue only occurs on 7800X3D CPUs and then that issue is occasionally made worse by some brands of motherboard's fail safes not functioning correctly and this has been primarily confirmed on ASUS boards
Which soc voltage do i look at on hwinfo VDDCR soc or CPU VDDCR soc Voltage Asrock X670e Taichi
Of course this all happens after I buy a 7800x3d and a x670e hero nothing put together yet but now I wonder if I screwed up going AMD pensive face
so by the sounds of it AMD and the boardvendors are both somewhat at fault as communication was lacking as well the SOC voltage issue is prodominintly on ASUS boards but there are other BIO's issues on ASROCK MSI and Gigabyte
Feels like AM5 is a rushed out platform
I blame AMD for this one People think oooh you are an AMD I am a speculator I guess I speculate that a company stuck behind another company's shadow is going to try and overtake their competitor This is totally fudge up on AMD they probably rushed schematics and didn't ensure their board partners were up to spec
Holy shit the one time I recommended an AMD setup to a friend who wants best of the best AMD fucked up To be fair I recommend to always buy 1 gen below latest but he wants 7950X3D sooo okay
Im jist gonna get am4 new and use it for a very long time
Wait is this just for the x3d CPUs or is it all 7000
Amd bios remains a mess You have ai tweak ODM section then you have amd overclocking section and another amd cbs section Some settings in some section overrule others Some settings do not reset when you input in particular section Amd is a problem
Imagine paying all that money for a super duper AM5 build then having to be super careful about which bios you use and motherboard as your parts are liable to go up in smoke And also imagine paying 2 grand for a 4090 but you have to be careful not to unplug it too many times or it might set on fire And yet people find this acceptable There s only one word that comes to mind Idiocy
this is a huge fuckery amd has always been lacking in proper and sufficient testing for their hardware and 't enough you are always self sabotaging when you are slightly ahead of intel
This is great here i am with 7800x3d and a ROG STRIX B650E E GAMING Did i understand it right If i turn off expo i should be on the safe side

i am about to drop a lot of money buying a 7800x3d and asus TUF x670e motherboard should i still go for it or go i9 13900k this now that its becoming more visible is really concerning to me
Very informative video My only question is What about non X3D CPUs My 7600X on my ASUS B650E E has a stock SOC voltage of 1 35V no EXPO I plan on changing this manually tonight and updating BIOS when ASUS releases a non Beta BIOS and addresses their problems Is there anything else I can do
Well Asus did say MULTIPLE times and have it plastered all over the board FOR THOSE WHO DARE Might as well have said No really just use it we dare you
So should I return my x3d if I haven't even opened it
Maybe this year instead of the Disappointing Buils he'll do the Disaster Build A nother M ega D isaster
Andddd I was about to go and build and now I'll go intel
we found improper failsafe protection on asus and useless OCP on ASUS CALLED IT

Man I think I dodged the worst of it Maybe Wasn t aware of this going on until I already had my 7800x3d and my ASUS motherboard put together Been on the BETA bios the entire time like 2 days Fingers crossed If it fails and burns my house down I m switching back to Intel as much as I hate saying that I ve always been an asus fanboy but this has me questioning it now though I know it s not 100 their fault but still
This is a good fuck up by everyone The lazyness and horrible quality control is getting worse everytime and i'm getting tired of it It doesn't matter how much you pay everything is a pile of garbage Remember the problems in the 3080 3090 because of poor capacitors solved with lower frequencies Remember precision boost overdrive applying absurd voltages beyond 1 4V in iddle CPUs Remember the exploding power sources Remember the RX6000 dying lately with no reason Remember the EVGA pile of shit that melted the GPUs in New World's menus and it was totally their faulty sensors that miscalculated temperatures and coolers rpm Remember when the ryzen 5000 series came out that the bios didn't fit in half of the motherboards and you needed to update the with an older ryzen cpu and losing the older CPUs support to get the 5000 series support I'm sick of it Pay overpriced products and they just don't deliver the bare minimum requirements of safety
Building a PC is still the Wild West but AMD need to step up their CPU game here
So while it looks like the board vendors are all having this problem they are different ASUS in particular AMD doesn't seem like they actually screwed up that badly I figured since all the board vendors had the bug it would be AMD's fault but guess not
Guess its back to the 5800x3d and time to return this crap
If AMD do not make a statement on monday a statement to remunerate reassure and protect early adopters no more AMD products Who is with me on this Unite we must to defeat the evil
ppl in these comments saying they ll never buy an amd cpu again lol
Im NOT buying an X3D CPU period Way too fragile and sensitive Will stick to 7600 or 7700 until Zen 5 6
An absurd high voltage of over 1 4V for just the SOC coming from an expo profile Most OC'ers know that SOC voltage usually relies within maximum memory speed Lets say your memory overclocking a little bit higher voltage could help but it's not infinite SOC voltage should have never gone above 1 2V and that has bin since the first Ryzen series Another thing is the reported software voltage vs what comes out of the VRM are complete different things and can differ up to 40 even Never trust auto voltages i mean if your running stock it's fine If your OC'ing auto voltage is ramping up with often higher voltages then really needed Asus and alot of other motherboard vendors have bin doing this since the Athlon XP and such to ensure stability and one click OC functionality If you wanna perfectly iron your OC the manual and hard testing is the only way to go again it takes a bunch of coffee and a night of testing but the result is often a ease of mind in regards maximum OC speed and safe voltages Asus is rushing things perhaps it wants to look good on review websites where the asus boards seem to clock higher longer better
Tech Jesus giveth and Tech Jesus taketh
Impressive amount of testing and much closer to an actual conclusive information compared to previous releases GN shines in these pieces I am not 100 picturing how these issues were permitted to go through but the ball is on AMD and Motherboard manufacturers process more than the actual product silicon I can half way ''understand'' the mess of the rollout of the fixes its a hard unusual issue but at the same time failures from running stuff out of specification is not exactly unexpected Again it sounds like major lack of process and of foresight
Really well done incredible that bugs and design mistakes that can be exposed by a bunch of enthusiasts have not been fixed by multi billion companies whos job is to produce those chips and mobos And Asus really let me down this time I will not be getting their products for a long time now
Now imagine all those users where CPU ran at 1 4V f or months If it regraded no one knows Would even it be possible to return RMA basing on probable degradation from manufacturers fault and get new one Probably it's nothing meaningful but how do we know Can we only wait
Near the end he starts talking about having found several errors and bugs within the AM5 platform Given all the testing they did I wonder if they did similar stuff for AM4 LGA 1700 and others if they would find a similar level of bugs Just curious if it's unique to the platform a first generation thing or just something that is common across all platforms and they are just overlooked because they are likely to cause actual issues for the end user
My 7800x3d is in the I wonder if they're going to issue recalls
Reminds me of the old days of the original Athlons that would self immolate if you removed the cooler or the fan failed on it due to the lack of any kind of temperature protection I also wonder if having the iGPU disabled helps prevent failure as GN showed that the failure seems to occur there I had the iGPU disabled at all times and system works fine even when the SOC was at 1 35V for a couple of months with my 7950X3D on an Asus board But that GN video is a good watch the incompetence or laziness or both is just shocking
when your expensive platform did not fully tested their product
I was about to return to AMD for the first time since Athlon 64 Not with all of these AM5 issues though this platform has some maturing to do I guess I ll just keep what I have for now
Welp that's the catch of becoming a literal beta tester for new product I'm still happy with my AM4 and I'll upgrade to the 5800X3D once I have the money
That's what Intel is better
Wish they were this quick to review the Alienware r15
went from 3900x 5900x 7950x3d after this debacle it will be the last time i am buying an amd product
TLFF50 SPEED I will say it more of AMD miscom with their ODM Asus set VSOC VDD on instructions As more buy into AM5 more buy up faster DDR5 which prices have fallen greatly There are more 6000 CL30 kits requiring 1 4v Bad combination As for OCP have GN tried your exact setup with other boards if OCP will kick in for such easy to kick up a frenzy and build up followers this way
Beyond the known issues of excessive SOC voltage and motherboard manufacturers doing whatever they want there are still many unknowns Even with low voltages how long will these chips last The fact that the AM5 platform works at all is like a small miracle Yeesh
AMD QA needs to be improved
Yeah I'm glad I decided not to upgrade from my 5950x to a 7950x3d when I heard about one chiplet deactivating when gaming Guess I wait for the 8950x3d and hope lessons get learned
I am so glad I stuck with my initial decision of just upgrading to the 5800X3D and not chancing my luck with the AM5 teething issues Who knew those teething issues would be so catastrophic fire
well BIOS gives us another headache who else knew about it s AMD really needs to step up for their quality assurance on the matter BIOS on 5000 series has never been smooth for many years EDC limitation USB drop out TPM stutter etc I hope the history should never be repeated on 7000 series
So does this mostly only apply to people on newer bios I E I've been on asus 0922 for a while now
Closed Beta Hardware
With the uncertainty of chips being degraded I feel like this is a time when AMD should up their warranty to say 5 years instead of 3 I kind of doubt there will be a real increase in RMAs but given this stemmed from problems caused by AMD and their communication regulation of motherboard partners there should be some give to the community that bought into the platform To me that would just be good PR The We stand by our product script etc This is embarrassingly bad for companies the size of AMD and its partners I think everyone expects growing pains of a new platform I did and I even enjoy some of the bugs because the bleeding edge is exciting and interesting but no one wants to or should have to worry their new expensive rig could be slowly cooking itself to death This is literally why I went AMD because I was uncomfortable with the crazy high wattages of intel 13th Gen and possible implications of long term damage founded or not it made me uncomfortable
As someone who is not very familiar with all the engineering terms can someone explain it in a for dummies kind of way what of these problems are on the hardware side and thus can't be fixed with the current iteration of boards and what problems can be solved via BIOS updates I have a 7800X3D next to me and was waiting for this video to then buy the motherboards thought of the Asus TUF X670e but probably will switch manufacturer now Not sure after the video if I should just send the 7800X3D back as my system should last me 6 7 years
Should i be concerned how likely is this to happen
So what maximum memory speeds and lowest timings are achievable by 7000 X3D chips when applying the 100 safe i e without the risk of degradation or failure voltage for IOD VDDCR SOC Is there some datasheet for Zen 4 chips that specifies the safe voltage ranges for every part of the CPU Also just found this lol Thanks GN guys for keeping us posted
So glad I didn't pull the trigger on an x670E build back in January as planned I'll wait for the dust to settle and BIOS updates are good Definitely won't be buying Asus though even if they fix the BIOS
AMD stands for Another Massive Disappointment this gen It's a shame that early adopters that spend a lot of money have to deal with these issues It's the very people that keep on buying new hardware and help these companies sell their latest product and it's still the very people that constantly get fucked by AMD on both CPU and GPU worlds
This is why I go intel
Guess this proves wrong the naysayers who claimed AM5 platforms was undercooked s Smartest people in the room watching from a 5800X3D system for a stress free weekend Jokes aside as long as everyone's RMA goes through without a problem and this can be fixed going forward there might be some good coming out of this AMD might push for advertised settings to be more rigorously validated Asus might even hire a second intern to work on BIOS
AMD reacted very quickly and did well for promoting BIOS updates Then I hope Ngreedia can also have a look on 4090 width 3028 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 6d90eb877765ab9648fabc22ae4a60e96e64c0b8 My friend's 4090 was burnt It's stock cable without modding Fully plugged and not bent at all He already RMA and got a new one But what if it happens again in the future The root cause is still yet to find Discuss with other NV users they would only say this is the user error But where is it How wrong can fully plugged and not bending be We might consider joining the red team in the future
had my fans enraging 2x in the last 48 hours for no reason the cpu almost hitting 90 and wont stop even if nothing is running this is a fucked up situation
I don't understand what he's saying AMD did wrong He seems to be just assuming that AMD isn't telling the board partners what the power limits are Or that AMD should be hand testing every single board to make sure the board partners are implementing the limits properly I'm not getting it
This whole saga reminds me of the 4090 cable melting Everyone who does NOT own the card kept whining but I have now used the card for six months running 3A games at 4K max settings enjoying every moment of it while watching jealous whiners who don t own the card going all out on Reddit Two months ago I bought myself MSI Meg Ace and 7950X3D and now I am experiencing Deja Vu Go back to your 3600X and 3060 kids Latest tech is not for you Now I am going back to play some more games while you whine and then have to decide whether to get 4070 or 4070Ti
I feel so fucking vindicated Back when the 5800x launched the sample I bought for myself would actively try to burn itself out in stock config CPU and Mobo and people told me I was somehow doing things wrong
this comment section is so weird two dead chips and everyone is swearing off amd or saying they dodged a bullet imagine if nvidia got this much hate during the 4090 thing too bad astroturfing the internet is legal
Looks like this could just as well have happened to Intel as well since it's motherboard manufactures pumping the juice to the CPU's x200B Anyone have any voltage numbers for Intel CPU's to see if this is really the case x200B Wow being downvoted for asking about voltages on Intel
Are these default DOCP settings safe Or is ASUS slowly degrading my 3950x CPU width 3923 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 78b7dcd4b2295ec3b45518adad018c9c42ae6814
Still trying to decide lol 50 tell me 7900XTX 50 tell me 4080 Reason if you want a powerful ray tracing 4080 if you want a more promising card choose the 7900XTX Tough decision both cards cost in my country 1400 1450 50 more for 4080 Help me decide crying face
Damn amd sucks remember how these fan boys were jerking off to nvidia
You guys are paranoid I've had my 7800x3d since release day updated to F4 Bios on B650 Elite AX Expo enabled I checked voltages because of you cry babies everything's fine If it dies it dies shrugs
So far its more like Motherboard OEM screwed up than AMD on this one
Tech Jesus is more interested in attacking product manufacturers than actually helping the community His approach to this is a disservice to the PC enthusiast community As a viewer what do I do with this information Just rage at AMD MB manufacturers The research is great but this video lacks what consumers can do to minimize their risk while AMD MB manufacturers work on a solution Finding a cause and pointing a finger is easy The hard part is actually understanding the issue and recommending a fix Tech Jesus hasn t done that
Even cracked die now did't we see this before with 6800 6900 series i guess these cpu's where used for mining as well or stored improperly in humid environment s
Man do people really just go from out rage to out rage now days Stop short of amd hand testing every product there's literally nothing they could have done It was even known by consumers that soc shouldn't exceed 1 25 yet somehow people are saying amd didn't tell manufacturers to limit voltage Lolwut
intel had same issue not to long ago with mobo manf really goosing the power specs yeah i forget his fan base only research they do is his
Glad we have these guys there to do this stuff only if they weren t so insufferable
This guys voice if so annoying I can t watch his vids and he plays with his hair too much Throw it up it a bun
If I m up to date on the bios on an msi x670e do I still need to take any precautions with this I d really rather my new pc not fucking explode
again with the chip that they brought to criticality it's not one of the ones adorned with a D on a likewise absent 5th row Can anyone in on the observation confirm or deny this to a layman like myself I was one of the ones that bought in late and was shipped it later and mine is D less on the lid surface The only chip this video revolved around seemed to be 10 31 which is not one and the same with the thumbnail one Does D or its lack of give a worrying prognosis into the longevity of the chip at all especially now with the prospects of confounding variables like this one Are these D designated ones more neuroplastic or I guess mechanically plastic as to be able to bounce back from voltage mishaps and the like On the April 8th launch every chip being tendered for review was a D denoted one and I am one to think there's been a strawman switch of targets with the culpability of all the 7800X3Ds converging on chips like mine making for a skew That is where the chips performed best ahead of the asus fiasco units like that in the thumbnail were used where we've moved to faulting the chips we've instead discriminated to use in no uncertain terms ones like in the ensuing video Meanwhile I've not seen the frying case be clinically documented in a D possessing chip and also haven't been replied to by owners of such
was rare to not see jays2clickbait do a video 5 seconds from first issue lol
Well I managed to call it in my earlier comments The voltage control algorithms are screwed
I'm on an older asus bios 1406 B650E F 7900x and have been monitoring my SOC voltage since this fiasco started expo 2 enabled and it has not broke 1 3v Does this mean I'm good Done both gaming and cinebench
So if I have updated BIOS with ASUS 1413 can I enable DOCP now
What tools dit he use for this Star Wars Jedi Survivor
When I got the 7800X3D and new parts I immediately updated the bios to the latest version I think I only ran it with SOC 1 36v for a day or two I'm on the latest non beta bios now which hard caps to 1 3v but manually set SOC to 1 25v with EXPOII Buildzoids timings I noticed hwinfo64 is reporting it slightly higher though at 1 266v I'm trying 1 20v 1 216v in hwinfo64 now to see how stable it is So far so good
this generation of CPUs is so stupid I switched to Apple SO NICE being able to run a powerful laptop without roasting my nuts or ruining my ears with fan noise
The Gigabyte failure would have been avoided if they had used Q flash plus to update their bios WITHOUT installing the cpu first I have that motherboard B650M and you can flash it with only psu power cables connected to the motherboard
what is the reliability of the current CPU eventhough its not melted
I ran my 7800X3D using MSI's BIOS from the 14th for a day or two never turned on EXPO I'm anxious though will this have affected me at all
nice video by gamers nexus
With all the drama around computer components this year Theres surely some paranoia based horror comedy skit made by the end of the year It just fits with the rifftrax Norman references
Here with Strix x670E E with 0805 Bios because this is the only one stable with 4x16gb and 7700x wondering what to do
amd and board partners need better communication with consumers hell most companies do these days

Just watched this verry interesting One thing I notice Steve hasn't mentioned much is the GPU portion of the i o die as I think that is where some of the problems come from I'm assuming that the GPU area recieves the largest voltages when it is being used in solo hybrid mode and if too much work is being done on that portion of the die it could lead to failure due to overheating
Installed new bios on my MSIB650 Edge paired with 7950x3d and EXPO I 6000 CL32 Lowered my CPU VDDCR SOC Voltage SVI3 TFN to 1 2 and and CPU VDDIO to 1 27 but CPU VDDCR VDD Voltage SVI3 TFN goes to max 1 330 V It this ok or CPU VDDCR VDD Voltage SVI3 TFN should be lower
Nvm
I have a 7800x3D on an MSI B650 motherboard I'm updating the BIOS rn but can someone decipher whether this would be an issue for me and my XMP RAM Seems like it isn't but better safe than sorry
I turned off my memory's EXPO mode and the CPU VDDCR SOC Voltage under CPU in HWINFO went from 1 24V down to 1 020V on my ASRock board So to reduce some voltage increase is to go non EXPO mode therefore I am going to try out the TeamGroup Elite Plus memory module that is still JEDEC compliant at 1 1V and is DDR5 6000 although it has a slower CAS of CL48 48 48 96 They also have a DDR5 5600 at CL46 46 46 90 act 2 index id 265 These are the only ones that I have seen that run at the JEDEC spec of 1 1V Any others advertising that voltage at those speeds are actually referring to if you ran them at DDR5 4800 speeds if you look up the model s
I ve been using my 7800X3D Asus B650E since April 11th I m wondering If I already caused damage and should exchange the cpu for another one before my 30 day return period is up Or should I just send it and hope for the best
I miss EPoX rock solid mobos they just sucked at marketing
Is this someting that should trouble people who own last gen Amd cpu's I have a 5900X along with Gigabyte AORUS Pro B550 motherboard at stock settings Should I start worrying
i bought the x670e TUF gaming plus wifi board it was on sale for 379 at best buy and i price matched it at CC ill hold onto it for another 13 days and if i don't see a stable bios released where EXPO is working i'll likely switch to i9 13900k hopefully ASUS gets their shit together with AMD and they fix this asap
I've said it for years Asus is garbage Not alone in this matter but they are an outliner as always I've had so many people defending 's shit and will always be but that's what I got No more
I wanted to upgrade my computer and was looking at AMD Ryzen 5 7600 while I haven't found reports of 5 7600 exploding I would imagine it has the same faults I'm guessing the safer option would be to wait before upgrading or not going with AMD
It would be probably be wise to skip the AMD Ryzen 7 build series for now until they figured out a solution o 0
is this issue related only to 670e series board ot does it also happens in their 790 series
I am kinda out of the loop I am interested in getting a Ryzen 70x But I am hearing that they are exploding Should I avoid them outright and go intel Or is there any decent combos that wont explode
Aren t those Samsung ssd dying too
Can't select the exact Nzxt case and PSU we are looking for but here The Boom Box

I have a 7800x3d and a 4090 I like to live dangerouslygrinning face with sweat

Just add Samsung SSD I think it was 990 and then its ultimate
The ultimate assassin tool Gift a PC like that to your target
That would be fun to
That's an amazing idea for a video just add the self immolating Nzxt case and you're all set Lol
The VERGE giveaway
Jaytwocent need to see this
I'd still update the bios personally The Soc voltage is the major one but he does mention other unspecified voltages were also tweaked in the newest bioses But maybe that's just me
I don't know if it affects the relevant values but for AMD HWMonitor is rubbish It can't get info on sleeping cores without waking them up which will affect clocks power measurements
HWMonitor is reporting 1 25V for SOC What if it's misreporting gif giphy 51Uiuy5QBZNkoF3b2Z downsized
If I were you I'd just manually slam 1 2 1 25V for SOC and have it off my head any sort of monitoring or whatever or having to rely on good BIOS versions That is plenty for EXPO that Ryzens can handle so mostly 6000Mbps
You and me both i ran my 7800x3d on expo for just over a week on x670e e wifi Im probably gonna have a look at the socket when i upgrade my gpu very soon
If you don't want to use the beta bios I'd recommend turning expo off and running your memory on JEDEC speeds until there is a new updated stable bios
had the x670e TUF here with the AMD and the 1410 Bios which ran at 1 35V for quit a while now with the update to 1413 it is also down to 1 24
People here overstate CPUs wearing out If it works now it'll probably work 20 years from now unless it gets zapped with a high voltage Whether it's sitting idle or going 100 for those 20 years
Worst thing is it could be year or two not months Fuck knows at this point I see a lot of people buying them on eBay just for it to die abruptly 2 3 years from now
Had my 7950x for few months now SOC is 1 35v Is higher better
I think you can monitor for the slow cooking by monitoring the voltages if they are raising overtime maybe a sign of slow damage However this is normal given a time span of years
I am running 7950x non 3D version using ASUS mobo and running 1303 bios using EXPO II Turned SoC and VDDIO MC voltage to offset minus 0 1 for SoC and 1 25v for VDDIO Will be running like this until newer BIOS is released and will wait for release notes to see what they are changing
They deleted the bios causing the issues but I'd still pay very close attention to voltages and temps
Check with hwinfo64
I bought an Asus ROG STRIX B650E F GAMING WIFI for my 7800X3D Installed everything at Release Day flashed 1410 Beta BIOS used EXPO with the RAM tortured my PC for 24 hours and nothing happened Then I saw that Reddit Post of the fryed Board and my face turned white Either my Board didnt have those issues or I was super lucky But I looked my RAM EXPO Specifications up Lo and behold my Corsair Vegeance RAM is specified for 1 25V Looking at comparison Websites thats not normal at all 1 25V and 1 3V RAM seems to be rare the majority runs at 1 35V or even worse at 1 4V Lucky me picking that RAM D
ASUS ROG Strix X670E E Gaming WiFi with a 7900X built in early February here Was running the 905 BIOS since then until all this hoohaw started this week Updated to 1202 the other night and they dropped 1303 a couple of nights later and now I see 1401 beta is out But right now on 1303 with only EXPO II AI Overclocking and basic PBO CBO turned on HWiNFO64 is reporting 1 35V on SOC and HWMonitor reports 1 394V 1 403V so WTAF Which is right and why are either so effing high If there's any upside to this situation it's that I only paid 250 for the mobo open box at Micro Center but come on While punching at ASUS seems the easy move the video clearly implicates AMD as being sloppy in their management of things It's as if the incompetence and rot which has habitually crippled their GPUs from delivering anywhere near their level of hype has bled over to the CPU side of things I switched to AMD for my first rig in nearly two decades because I wanted socket longevity for a change rather than being stuck with whatever I built with for 6 years and now this Not Cool No pun intended
You're willing to wait for the CPU to fail months from now when the warranty potentially voids Should probably contact AMD at the very least to see if you can get a replacement CPU of a different model in light of this issue
how do you monitor SOC with HWMonitor i cant figure it out
It's an obscure issue that affects like 0 01 of users It's just doom hype as usual around here You'll be fine
Doesn t seem as premium as it s price anymore unamused face
Hey they give you fair warning For those who dare
I have never had good luck with Gigabyte or ASUS Always running into issues I prefer MSI or ASROCK for AMD builds
Never owned any other motherboard brand apart from ASUS Guess I might need to try the others
The sad thing is this was completely avoidable for them
without watching the video i had a feeling it was going to be asus
Thank goodness I went with MSI I've never had a good PC component from Asus they always prematurely crap out on me or arrive DoA The only good thing I have from them is the laptop I bought in 2020
They still do Just watch some of Louis Rossmanns videos
And BS marketing around it Same with politicians really regardless of policy
If we didn't have reporting like this there would just be a couple random reports of people who had fried CPUs which were returned under RMA and the panic would die down Mass manufacturers don't aim for 100 quality As far as they're concerned nothing is a bad product until it comes back at a higher than average RMA rate It's so much easier and cheaper to replace a few fried CPUs and motherboards than do actual root cause analysis and mitigation In this case perhaps the RMA rate would start to raise eyebrows at ASUS after a few months and they would maybe roll a quick and dirty fix into the next regular BIOS update and never announce that there was a problem Now that there is so much more information out there thanks to GN I think AMD and ASUS will be forced to roll out a more comprehensive fix and a better explanation
Well the parts where he says that it's not that widespread to panic and that it was difficult to reproduce seem to be largley ignored
this is why i buy swag from and occasionally donate they re fighting the good fight
That's about all you can do at the moment but the issue is more complex than just SOC and EXPO settings in BIOS needing to be becoming more stable it relates to their implementation and reporting as well From a monitoring perspective the board may still be pushing more than specified or shown clearly For example go back in the vid and pull the part where they've set EXPO to 1 35v but it's spiking up to 1 39 1 41v in prime95 EXPO is increasing voltage on all boards to some extent but all except Asus are technically under the 1 3v cap supposedly being set in recent BIOS updates Those voltage values are from both using HWiNFO and hard wiring leads to the boards themselves There are additional concerns in relation to incorrect PROCHOT values or it not functioning correctly at all They're supposedly going to be capping SOC going forward but that's not entirely a sufficient fix and EXPO shouldn't be causing excess SOC voltage to begin with Definitely not enough to literally desolder a CPU Asus boards in particular have issues with OCP not triggering different but similar issues with PROCHOT and artificially and unnecessarily boosted SOC voltage when EXPO is enabled This is why the board died along with the CPU in testing but the Gigabyte board survived despite the CPU dying There are also question marks remaining as to how exactly the Gigabyte board in question failed since that one apparently didn't have EXPO enabled at all EXPO itself think of it again as sort of an XMP it has nothing to do within the profiles about VOC EXPO does not contain a number for the SOC voltage Applying EXPO shouldn't necessarily state that you are applying a necessarily high voltage That's on motherboard vendors That's on Asus
The intro shows a multimeter measuring 1 446v and pans to showing a Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite AX's bios screen displaying EXPO disabled and SoC voltage on auto Wow what the 's wrong they are then heard saying Granted later in the video it says that it's a bug which they found to be present in the F5a bios version but who knows if that's fixed in their latest F5b bios or and now I don't know if this one will even be safe to build on the video shows that it killed someone's 7800x3d on boot
Pretty much I guess for most people it is to lower SOC voltage enough so it never exceeds 1 35V but not too low the cpu can t run
I m not really familiar with the Soc part how exactly do u check the voltage of that again
I'm glad I decided to pass on enabling EXPO after recently building my new system I think I'll leave it off I'm fine with 4800mhz anyway coming from my unstable AM4 RAM that couldn't surpass
or you know as i have said before dont buy motherboards from companies with a dodgy past
seeing the video I saw no problems with Expo XMP off I will run that for some weeks to wait for some more BIOS updates that are stable
Near the end of the video Steve says Expo is not the culprit but more likely ASUS being lazy and trying to improve memory comparability but using unsafe SOC voltages when EXPO is enabled When Wendell tested other motherboards ASUS was the definite outlier The Gigabyte board caused CPU damage possibly because of a bios bug but protection was working so motherboard was safe Also ASUS OCP is not working Honestly after watching this video I have decided to never buy ASUS boards cause clearly they are lazy and deceitful you have two controllers which persons paid extra for and they are not providing the protection it should I haven't upgraded to AM5 yet but if I did I would still use expo but to ensure its not ASUS and the SOC voltage is less than 1 3 volts
keep an eye on SOC and make sure its not too high or just not use expo at all and wait until bios updates become more stable So basically we as users have to actually lose time double checking a thing that should PROPERLY I don't any more stress in my life Guys this is not a beta test This is a released product motherboard CPU which should have been already passed QC tests
The easy button for non expert users is just run RAM at stock JEDEC settings and just ignore the noise for the next month or so There will be a lot more information coming out some theories will be disproved some will be confirmed and other new problems will come to light Steve mentioned other issues that would take too long to discuss for the video If he's talking about them and saying the AM5 platform is hot garbage they are probably issues worth fixing AMD and ASUS both have enough resources to get the bottom of this if consumers show they actually care Eventually there will be a BIOS update to take care of everything I bet that half of the people buying these stupid 700 motherboards don't even know how to set EXPO and don't ever enter the BIOS menu
More ironic than that new ASUS BIOS warning that basically says hey if we fuck up your product you can't claim warranty or sue us
I'm actually only on 1202 for my ProArt and that was only for about a week now Was on 1104 I think it was prior So not the beta versions I DID bump up SoC to 1 30 and 1 35v maybe 1 4 can't remember for maybe 10 15 minutes total but it added no stability to what I was trying to tweak so it went back down to 1 25 after following Buildzoid's timing video My RAM was XMP however and not EXPO Still working and at 1 2v SoC now gets errors going much lower
I am running a beta bios LOL I'm guessing Asus really was the worse offender of the MB mfgs Their voltage is so unnecessarily high The other boards all have bugs that can potentially mess up the voltage if you were playing around with the voltage previously and didn't clear cmos but less likely an issue unless you do something crazy still a bad bug But out the door I think Asus pushing those voltages was the biggest indication already I'm glad I went Asrock x670e taichi this round I almost bought a x670e Crosshair Extreme board because it was discounted 300 400 at my local Microcenter from returns I wanted to splurge a bit Glad I dodged that bullet
We did some testing with the 7800x3d and Asus 670 hero motherboard glances at PC Sigh
That s me Literally at this moment
Watched this from my completely stable 7950x3D with expo turned on Bios updates came fast
Is the beta bios stable
beta BIOS EXPO enabled U
lol bios 1202 asus with 670e
I have a 7800X3D witha Asus board that is waiting to be turned on becouse of their incompetence to make a bios
I was going to buy this exact CPU but luckily these reports have been coming out before I upgraded I got a 5800x so I'll just wait a gen
Risk of Gamers
Let's be honest gigabyte and msi are both utter trash Anybody got experience with asrock Like what good manufacturers are left
was the go to how For example my Phenom II board don't ask model or chipset can't remember as it was decade ago died just soon after warranty ended never touch anything Asus again and never had any MOBO problems ever since Unless you mean purely by marketing and how premium they picture ROG to be lmao
Yeah my Crosshair Dark Hero x570 can't run my 3600mhz RAM past 3200mhz
when were Asus the go to before or after their 5700 XT Strix was shit and they tried to blame AMD for it after months of denying the problem existed
They were more serious than we thought
Well at least AMD had the sense to claim they'll accept RMA EXPO or not when Asus actually went as far as to add that stupid EXPO may void warranty not guaranteed to work Edit my bad I really thought they mentioned warranty in that message message to their newest BIOS
These dirty dirty bastards
The thing that gets me is the statement on overclocking From an AMD perspective I can understand why they won't warranty it The consumer market is not their entire market Opening the door to warranty out of spec products might open the door for their Enterprise customers to push buttons they're not supposed to The board manufacturers on the other hand trying to say they won't warranty overclocking kind of brings their entire existence into question IMO For example my ASUS board has a lot of widgets and features Which of those features can I actually turn on without it being considered overclocking or non standard If I don't have a reasonable expectation that I can expect some kind of warranty on the board then there is literally no reason for me to just go entirely off brand with some other board maker that nobody ever heard of The risk factor is exactly the same in that I can't expect a warranty between the million dollar company and some guy in his garage
I love how the FX 9590 is still usually used as an example in such contexts
I imagine ASUS employees shove pennies in their fuse boxes
Engineers at ASUS thought everyone got that liquid nitrogen cooling More likely they thought about ways to legitimize increased prices and margins And to make it worse we have Youtubers ranking boards by VRMs and say that 200W VRMs are okay for the low and mid range CPUs and only these 400W VRMs are good enough for the high end CPUs It's stupid
Cross fingers it can be solve with bios update cuz I m really liking my amd system
I am staying on 0821 with SOC 1 2V and waiting for the new AGESA 1 0 0 7
loudly crying faceI have a 7700x running at 1 35V SOC for the last 6 months Steve said this could have resulted in CPU degradation Will AMD consider a RMA for this
So the safe one is 1 25v Prev i use 0821 bios yes i know its old but it works now im on 1413
Running the exact same memory kit here MSI x670e ACE 7700x and the bios just prior to the latest with x3d support also had SOC at 1 36 Only the very latest v182 bios dropped it to 1 30 Previous bios is also pulled for the ACE just noticed this morning I'm still seeing VDDIO at 1 36 still though Been running like this since the start of December I have a 7800X3D sitting in a box that got delivered last Tuesday just when this news broke gonna wait until AGESA 1 0 0 7 is released to install it just to be sure
My 7950X3D seems completely stable at 1 15V with Buildzoid's DDR5 timings Am I just lucky or is this expected for X3D chips
Super noob question in hw monitor mine is 1 24v I updated the bios last night for my asrock 670x Taichi Do I need to do anything else such as turn off expo
Did you leave expo enabled I'll probably do the same as you set manually Soc voltage to be safe
Try setting it lower yet manually maybe 1 2 I just stress tested my 7950x3d on 1 2 with no problems
When this news broke i manually set my SOC to 1 2v waiting on a proper bios still using the previous one before the beta bios just incase and lowered my vcore and SOC down soc was 1 35v down to 1 2v and vcore was about 1 16 down to 1 06 goes up and down the vcore a bit but they are the averages which should keep me safe x200B though it seems this wont affect everyone anyway
Early access should be discounted We are paying more than what people will pay when the v1 0
The changes listed for F8c don't mention anything about fixing it so I'm assuming it has not yet been fixed I have the exact same board but I am on F8a The SOC voltage in hwinfo seems to be 1 245 1 25V regardless of the load that I put on it I have EXPO still enabled I do run a non X3D 7950X
1 25 is fine
i only see one SOC voltage in my hwinfo CPU SOC under the motherboard section mines an asus board Edit y bad there's another one in the CPU section and that's the one that matters the mobo one is inaccurate due sense vs socket sense
It's definitely been cut short By how much though nobody can say
your chip's lifespan has been effectively cut short IMO this makes second hand 7000 series chips a more sketchy situation at least for now
If the SoC voltage was as high as 1 4 than yeah probably degraded your chip a bit seems like only one really bad offender in this case Asus allowed that to happen
It's impossible to know that's the truth Nobody can give a definitive answer the platform is only 7 months old
Hmmm good question thinking face while the 3d chip are more fragile and tend to have this issue more the normal X can also have this issue according to Steve so chances are people who had bought since launch last year and never check those voltage and probably have it high will probably a shorter life span Won t be surprise if that s what happened to that 7700x and 7900x that exploded
I'm not a fan of Asus boards neither We once bought an Asus LGA775 board that was compatible with the new Core 2 processors Long story short apparently it wasn't compatible with anything higher than Windows XP Took me some time scratching my head replacing drives and installers trying to install Vista When 7 was released I tried it again and nope I learned that Asus don't make good boards
Yeah i never buy Asus shit They always put in beast level hardware and then fuck the firmware up Seemingly every single time I have a 270hz monitor from them right now I have to go into service menu to fix the overdrive on it every single day Piece of shit
Thx for the ELI5 too stupid for nuance summary
No Amd fucked up badly I bet you put Gskill Z5 Neo 6000CL30 1 4v on ANY AM5 motherboard with older AGESA turn on EXPO you get your 1 4v VSOC
AMD fucked up by not triple checking that ASUS and Gigabyte weren't doing stupid shit
The server version of this CPU if I remember correctly the chipset is on the CPU itself not on the motherboard I get that AMD wants its partner to customize the boards but AMD needs to be strict with this kind of product They know that this kind of CPU is sensitive to voltage but they still let their board partners run wild prime example ASUS WTF are you doing again ASUS
tfw Am on Asus Board tfw have 7800x3d tfw constantly checking temps and core voltage
Listen to Steve 33 41
Yep no one can tell now if damage is done until it actually shit itself into magic smoke People who hasn t experienced it even tho they have it for months including me can encounter this problem later on unless ur really lucky and won the silicon lottery of having a very sturdy cpu I love my amd system and it s been great so far but this gen is utterly trash I don t know how this get pass amd and into the public without them noticing
zen 3 is solid and it even has a cpu that can tap into current gen performance or in other words it perfects the zen of old and offers a decent bite of the future
I'm over here with the 5800X I bought at the last Black Friday sale that Microcenter had and thinking I made a damn fine choice
When I bought the 5800X the 5700X just launched and the 7000 series soon after I had regrets as DDR5 prices came crashing down a year later Maybe I should have held out on my almost dying 2500k and my fianc 's 965BE He got my 2500k when I upgraded Now I feel vindicated for choosing a 5800X D
I have learned to skip the first year of a new socket
Aye same here I will probably side grade to a 5800X3D to stay with AM4 for another 5 years
I've got a ROG 650 A and a 7800x3d within the return period in my closet I dunno man I think I might take these back to Microcenter and build Team Blue which I haven't done in years AM5 sounds like it needs some help At the very least the mobo for sure is going back Edit Got some sleep and decided that burning the whole thing to the ground was overkill so I'll keep the cpu I did just get back from exchanging the mobo for an AsRock though
Why build a new PC now then if you're just going to build another one again in only two years Are you made of money
How is that your takeaway here lmfao
I just bought more Zen3 systems for stability
I went 3600 to 5800X and it was a very noticeable upgrade
I m staying on my 3700X until I ll eventually need a new GPU
This happened with Ryzen first gen and b350 boards You never buy the first gen of anything especially cars Slap that x3d in and profit
It is bold assumption that old platform doesn't have those bugs They most certainly do it is just that it doesn't burn so people don't look at it Maybe the set point voltages are safer but issues with OCP and the root cause why it actually melts after failure is likely there too
Yep Most vendors are in the process of making a full release with the new AGESA that should enforce some lower voltage caps
Update your bios after the vendors release their stable version and for now while you wait dont overclock dont use xmp expo on your system to be safe
I have the same cpu mobo combo and have been happy with msi even from prior products With that said it was a blessing in disguise that i only ran my new build for 1 2 days with the 1 35v soc voltages before i went on vacation and came back to this nightmare
How are boot times on the board I might do the same
He focused on Asus cause that's what he had MSI also ran 1 35v with expo enabled too
Also on this mobo After bios update soc got down to 1 3V and after one more reboot without any changes in bios settings it caps at 1 19V so far with expo enabled
Yes open settings then the alerts tab
But dude we got better VRM so the price is fine how else would it pump 440Watts to the cpu
Install the BIOS update that should be released already or very soon for your board
If you want to be on the safe side update your BIOS before even inserting the CPU using the USB stick and Qflash button
His has you set SoC to 1 25v
He recommends 1 25V for SOC in his Hynix guide And pretty sure you'd be fine with 1 2V for 6000MT s most likely that's what I've been running for 6000 CL30 Check the actual voltage though Setting the value at 1 25V doesn't autmatically mean that's what you'll be getting A lot of motherboards like to overshoot example you set 1 25V SOC in BIOS but the value read after is 1 28V
1 25v SOC is basically what the bios fixes are implementing by lowering to 1 3 or less
buildzoid to the rescue I'm glad I used his hynix settings before I started running games on my 7800x3d
Kinda weird that everyone had the same problem thinking face maybe it was a miscommunication between amd and motherboard manufacturers on what the cpu can hold and cannot hold
Seems like MSI and ASRock are under less of a spotlight
Looks like ASUS is by far the worst
The video explains it clearly but from what I understand all board MFGs have potential bugs if you were to adjust voltages manually Asus on old bios was the biggest offender with how much voltage they shove in by default and also had a very dangerous start up bug that bypass safety features In generally all motherboards are safer than Asus Just keep updating bios asap though
Same but i've updated to the latest bios regardless SOC Voltage seems to be on 1 195V without any XMP so below the safe 1 3V that AMD tells us
imagine he would have said that its not save to run this chip at the moment for me it looks like that most tech youtubers are very careful about what they say openly because they don't want to be responsible for a mass return of the chip
Classic AMD Same shit with CPU GPU They got very good hardware but the driver firmware part is a total buggy shity fest
Yes this is real problem Amd is not giving enough support to ODM for client segment It is funny GN is throwing Asus under the bus when Amd is giving half a communications
Where did you see DDR5 RAM that runs at 5600 stock Usually it's 4800 5600 sounds like midrange EXPO
it is D and to be honest it should be enough performance for most games for now till they figured it out When I saw the table they showed with the voltage figures with expo disabled you clearly saw no problems at all
Default is 4800 AMD spec is 5200 5600 is not stock
In the video Steve mentioned EXPO is not to blame but a combination of failures from the motherboard vendors If you want the best performance you should still pair it with a 6000MHz Cl30 kit
Update to the latest BIOS using flashback and then build that system
maybe wait till the agesa update will be released i read it will be available on 6 next month not sure if true
Get that oscilloscope
Check for smoke All kidding aside just don't leave it on auto perhaps a full bios flash also fixes a stuck input
Those delayed fans and aio may have save u a lot of trouble
I upgraded from a 1700 to a 7800X3D both bought early after launch I'll probably wait for the second gen of CPU for AM6 I guess
Meh no problems here and I built at launch I even have a 4090 without a burnt 12VHPR connector The internet sure likes to take tiny problems that will affect hardly anyone and blow them way out of proportion
AM4 was as well My 5800x was a mess but when I switched to a 12700k there was no major issues besides the default power limits being set to unlimited on most boards On a 13900k now and it's rock solid No regrets going to lga1700
Na definitely not What GN does is phenomenal and very valuable for the community but they're mostly working on a black box from the outside That's why they have to put so much effort and time into analysing and troubleshooting this issue AMD and motherboard manufacturers on the other hand are not working on a black box they are the ones who created the hardware and software in the first place so they know what's inside that black box and their resources to analyse and troubleshoot these things are so much more profound Will manufacturers make these findings publicly available Of course not why would they They're going to fix their stuff release new AGESA and BIOS versions and be done with it
It probably isn't not really They'll have access to far more equipment then Steve does and they'll have engineers whose job is to do this
face with diagonal mouth yeah I wish I had a time machine to smack my younger self and not get Asus lol
It's fine for the 5000 series though right
What values are you checking on HWINFO The Core VID VSOC What values are you seeing on your system max
They will still deny it tho regardless some people seem so hang up on tribalism and refuse to believe any negative on what team they are on
Of course I had some guy reply to me from earlier in the week saying look it was ASUS while trying to defend AMD They went out of their way to go BACK to an old comment to continue to defend AMD from any fault Some folks really just need to stop worshipping tech companies and associating their identity with them
Read up about the early days of X99 it was disastrous Chips and boards lighting on fire it was every bit as bad as this just it didn t affect the consumer socket so it wasn t quite this widespread Not to diminish the fuckups here though This is pretty bad and probably low key damaged pretty much everyone s cpu to some degree
I switched back to Intel from 5900x If you didn t know 5000 release was buggy as hell but at least cpus didn t explode It included USB stuttering WHEA errors unstable behaviour with high speed RAM and so on It was eventually fixed with AGESA updates but people paid their own money for beta testing an AMD product And here we go again with 7000
does make the socket bend seem pretty small potatoes ngl
Nah they already did they mistake and so did Nvidia It's Intels turn now to blow up high end hardware P
I always went Intel and Nvidia for stability reasons even though my current build is a 5800X3D RX6800 I'm probably lucky for now That being said m future PC builds will be back to Nvidia and Intel A CPU with L3 cache while keeping high clock speeds stable would be a dream Probably not possible ATM
I just ordered a Asus ROG Strix B650E E and the 7800X3D since my i5 8600 is old and limiting by 3080 A friend goes by AMD as a competitive gamer recent benchmarks looked good and the fact that AMD doesn't change sockets every 2 gens was something that made it alluring Finding reports of boot times the confusing numbering with their GPUs RAM timings the requirement on a low level BIOS button the multiple E and non E chipsets X3D not great for general purpose productivity etc has been giving me headaches This is just makes me feel worse about my purchase I feel I should have just waited for the 14th gen or just have gotten the 13700K Currently debating on returning it on arrival EDIT So I made it seem like I looked into the CPUs after the purchase but that was done prior Reworded that The CPU burn out was more recent
Switched back after RAM issues with the 1700 and 2700x Thankful for AMD bringing the competition and making Intel actually do something but yeah One 9900k and now 13900k with no issues sticking for Intel and hoping they keep up
Just avoid ASUS and Gigabyte and you should be fine
Yup I'm vehemently anti Intel because of their monopolistic past they've still got another 9 years to go before I consider them for CPUs but they haven't really had this kind of problems
My feeling 100 I went AMD again the first time since Athlon64 and now all this BS happening
Both side has quite history of fucked up I think for the user it was whether they got caught in the roulette or not
Intel has CPU bending problems leading to poor cooling and also XMP issues at least with the 12th gen on DDR4 It's the flip side of their competition They have to push things fast and hard to keep up On the positive side we have nice performance and reasonable pricing
I expect there's someone out there that went team red and ended up with a faulty vapor chamber 7900 XTX and had an X3D chip meltdown on them That's a sad realization AMD always manages to continually throw away all the good graces they earn It's not even a Murphy's law thing it's a skill at this point
I said for years after the original zen came out that I would never buy AMD both because of the fanbase bashing Intel users for supporting in their eyes an evil Cyberpunk megacorp and the barrage of good close enough claims on FPS counts I saved for a year and a half through a pandemic waited patiently for the new x3d's because I was impressed by the performance and thought I was too hard on AMD for all that time And now I just HAPPENED to stumble upon this issue on buildzoid's channel immediatellly turned off EXPO and limited my voltages but I have zero idea if how long I've been damaging my CPU Ranting on reddit changes nothing but I feel like AMD should be aware of how many people just do not want this hassle I spend over 1 5k on this build I can't afford to replace a 600 chip because of some insane D D dice roll failure
Yea same here The vcache gains are real in some applications but there's more to life than vcache friendly games
i dont think they will
Open HWiNFO and check VDDSOC and SOC voltage while running a cpu stress test It must be no more than 1 3v or you are in trouble 1 1v is even better Optionally disable EXPO entirely until AMD resolves this situation or go in to the bios and set SOC to something less than 1 3v They say there is more to this story than just SOC voltage but the other problems happen after the SOC problem
are you using EXPO 1 or EXPO 2 profile for 6000 MT S
it did change That board was made by Pegatron for Asus These new ones post z97 are made by ECS
They need stop these childish marketing antics It usually doesn't work out well for them They should Just focus on their products and sell on the improvements they have accomplished over their prior gen That's exactly what Nvidia does and the reviewers do the rest Take these cringe stabs at the competitor doesn't work They should know that by now But I guess they don't really have a whole lot to market that is new at least for the Radeon lineup So maybe that's why
Me too Not happy
Unfortunately you found out
The odds of having a problem are low Regardless this one of the reasons I'm waiting until Zen 5 I'll let other people work out the bugs
Na you'll be fine with this I mean tech jesus himself said that this isn't easy to reproduce and now with the BIOS updates you really should be fine either way If you still feel unsafe best skip this generation in general from both AMD and Intel and go for 5800X3D since you've likely got a compatible motherboard
If you turn off expo it runs at 4800 CL40 which costs 10 15 performance
overreact My man MBs CPUs are literary melting with no user error
As someone who had at that point a 00 error code when updating to their latest bios then 13 while my pc was on for like half hour or longer trying to reset cmos did not do anything and then finally foxed it by removing the battery My pc still runs now but would that be worrying
Its not EXPO related
In the video Steve explicitly said it s not a problem with EXPO it s a problem with how motherboard manufacturers implemented EXPO This fault certainly includes AMD but EXPO is not the reason for this
same here bro I've always been intel The 5800x3d was really good and done everything I wanted first time back on AMD since Athalon 64 but I'll be going back to intel this generation
Didn t they add another set at the end They will also do more testing and have a follow up video in a few weeks so more cpu and motherboard will be sacrifice
Yeah I'll support channels who actually put in the effort into their content There's this one guy whose channel is about gaming with 450k subs He pumps out videos every day talking about random gaming news mostly Nintendo he probably sees on Reddit And worst of all he uses click bait titles to get views I just don't understand how people subscribe to that guy
Board partners were setting high SOC voltage especially when EXPO profiles were enabled so the memory could run faster For CPU to take advantage of the faster memory speeds it also needs to push the memory controller a bit more So when EXPO was enabled SOC voltages were increased to compensate Issue is that they increased TOO much Why the board partners thought that was OK is unknown They should have had the max specs from AMD so who dropped the ball We don't know Over time the high SOC voltage degrades the silicon to a point where a short circuit is created Each silicon is different based on binning quality so if you have a lower quality bin you will see this happen sooner than others If such a case happens the board should have protections in place where if it recognizes a short circuit or something off with CPU it doesn't provide power to it These protections Over Current Protection or OCP did not work ASUS high end boards even have additional hardware in place for this but those also did not work The board kept pumping current into the CPU even though it's already shorted out which creates excessive heat increasing resistance so board pumps even more power to a point where the temps get so high it melts the solder from IHS separating it Now the substrate PCB takes on all the heat and eventually pops damaging both CPU and Board in process The reason we have seen damage in similar places is because that's where the short initially begins and is now the hotspot my opinion So question is why did the board partners do this Where is the check and balance from AMD I feel we may never find out and this will get patched via Bios or possible future hardware inclusions and never addressed Concern now is for those people who have been running high SOC voltage for prolonged period they are now concerned if the silicon was being cooked and if there is lasting degradation that has reduced their CPUs life expectancy Will it develop a short eventually If so how will the boards handle it It's a reasonable concern but with no real answer as it's impossible to know
derbauer had a 7900x non 3d with similar damage and a gigabyte board with expo off killed a 7800x3d as well unless i missed something
I was in the exact same boat Had my 7800x3d and x670e all ready to assemble then the GN video came out Sad to say I returned everything today and switched to intel I don t have time to monitor temps consistently or any extra head space to be concerned about damaged components like I used to I wish everyone else the best of luck though Hoping the next bios takes care of all the issues
His the one who wanted the X3d so he can t really blame u if his system blows up lol
X3D is more sensitive to and fragile with higher voltages and temperatures Nonetheless both 7000 X3D and non X3D users alike should set aside some time to seek out an updated BIOS UEFI from their motherboard vendor with AMD's mitigations implemented
debauer had a toasted 7900x so anything can blow up if its overvolting it just that the X3D chips seem more likely to blow up
No i dont find it acceptabel Thats why i went AMD to start with The amount of f ckery from Intel was just to much Sad this had to happen to AMD just shows its not good to fanboy
update your bios they capped the soc to 1 30v on the latest ones but yea if you turn off expo and don't manually change your ram frequency you're fine you can use hwinfo to check the soc voltage it shouldn't be above 1 3v
Went back between AUTO or dabbled with 1 25 or 1 2 limits Updated hte bios every time a stable version had I'm back on Auto and waiting for the AGESA update wondering if everything's alright with it or
check your cpu if youre using air cooler
I ve got a 7800x3d with a TUF x670e waiting for the rest of my parts Went that way over a 13900k for efficiency gains that can really add up if you re planning to keep for the long term and not upgrade every couple years That and I can air cool keep my same case and psu I guess a 13700k would be more comparable but still wouldn t be as efficient if you don t have other cpu intensive productivity tasks going on I m gonna stay the course and just not oc until there s a solid bios version out of beta
Get 13600k b660 and upgrade frequently
We are also affected but not very common since the 3d chip are more fragile so u see this a lot on them As for the X chip we won t know if the chip is slowly dying but as far as I know we already have cases of regular X chip having the same issue
no why
I'm debating whether I should return my 7800X3D but after waiting years to build I may just keep it My other option would be the 13700K but the high temperatures and high power consumption are the opposite of what I wanted for my new build since I'm air cooling Plus with AM5 there is an upgrade path How valuable that is depends on the buyer of course
If you can return it yes Otherwise go with it But keep a fire extinguisher in close proximity
Don't overeact Most people didn't have issues GN also clarified it's gonna be rare for it to happen bad silicon lottery is an important factor and the the new bios will fix it for those weaker chips out there I don't see a reason to return it i do see a reason to atleast check monitor soc voltage and update the bios But thats all
A 7800x3D 32gb ddr5 6000 cl30 expo z670e Steel Legend and some other components were waiting my 7900xtx for arrival Now I'm just waiting to receive back the money from Amazon after returning everything My 3570k and 8600k have been working oc'ed for years without issues This time I let's try team red These cpu seem amazingly efficient for the insane performance they can
they're a better deal across the board anyway Except maybe the 7800X3D for gaming
I ve had an asus board do the same shit to a broad well e processor Destroyed it in short order with crazy high voltage Since then I ve always verified the voltages as safe during testing
That's not at all the entire 's failing on every motherboard I'd guarantee if you look closely at a Gigabyte MSI Asrock motherboard you'd find similar issues
Ok let s go to he corner and drink some meds rolling on the floor laughing
Im kinda in the same boat aways trusted asus but now im not sure what vendor to give a try
In general whenever anyone buys hardware I try to steer them away from Asus They seem to be running on former glory which is now non existent I don't remember when's the last time they did anything both positive and outstanding
RX6000 deaths were not for no reason they were from improper storage and cleaning powerwashing by a miner offloading his stock Which is why those failures were so localized in Germany If that was actually an issue with the GPU itself the failures wouldn't be exclusively in German and all around the same time
Yeah if it just just feature not working correctly t is not as bad but when it gets to such things as safety it really bad
Went amd for the first time this gen and I m very disappointed with everything that is happening
It s more like amd should have caught this before it went to the public but they didn t The major screw up is with the motherboard vendors specially Asus but in the first place why did they do it like that It so weird that multiple motherboard brand is having the same issue that u would think Amd gave the ok signal for it thinking face
Or just set the voltage to 1 25
5800 is trash too tbh
Or just switch your board to a safer brand board
Cringe
I'm with you
I mean can t really blame them since amd really messed up and this is straight up scary if it happened to u I myself was gonna upgrade my 7700x to a 7800x3d and make an entire new system with the 7700x with budget stuff for secondary system but I probably won t do that anymore I ll just hang on my 7700x for now since I can t really return it anymore and hope it doesn t go bye bye on me This is a lesson not to jump right away on a new product and see if it stable or not a few months later
Waiting for the Intel f up and those ppl having to buy ARM processors for the rest of their lives
Even the mid range one are expensive things for most people You can't blame them for wanting something that works without fear at such prices
Sort by new AGESA fault It maps VDD into VSOC in earlier versions
Not for the cpu itself Probably not for the MB either Just fix it in bios updates
The iGPU is the biggest mystery Amd decided to run it on vcore which results in a big delta from what ccds use vcore for Honestly disabling the iGPU for now would the correct wise thing to do It's 5w component supplied by vcore that can push 400w when things go wrong
Are you having issues
With the 7950x3d are you more pissed about the bios motherboard cock up or being baited into buying a worse gaming processor than the 7800x3d Or both
First gen chipsets for am4 were also a shitshow
This isn t a teething issue this is gross negligence incompetence
I was gonna go that route but my x470 crosshair couldn t run the new gen video cards so I had to upgrade all
AMD can't enforce partners' QA They can give guidelines though
My understanding was that older bios was part of the issue Updating is actually what you want to do to help prevent the issues in the vid
Its all fixable by bios updates It's motherboard manufacturers being cowboys and applying out of spec voltages and AMD not checking these motherboards manufacturers and possibly not directing clear guidelines to them I will give it a week and it will probably all be fixed by then
Yep same Switching to intel
Literally already solved with a bios update
Why 670 B650E's great and looks less SOC volted too
Hard Lesson I learned this week sadly
Honestly the loud majority in these communities dont and wont care It's just a fan club MFers siting on an rx7900xt x idling at 100w saying it's no big deal for a card that costs around a grand and is missing half the features of the competitor cards in both games and productivity
Sadly amd will also use those connector so unless ur getting amd gpu from this gen then chances are next gen amd gpu will have those connectors But hey things can change and let s hope that they recognize that those pins are crap and never use it again man shrugging light skin toneand yes I also have the 4090 and it s been great but those damn connectors are horrible
Clearly AMD didn t effectively communicate to mobo partners on the chips limits It s AMD s responsibility to do so This whole debacle could have been avoided
So you bought the 4090 to brag about it and make people u don't know and don't know you jelous
They did get this much hate In fact AMD as a company went as far as to throw rocks with Twitter comments about staying safe I don t see Intel throwing rocks AMD is eating some humble pie and they deserve it
Intel is usually on top of it It has stricter controls and validations so their partners vendors are not running their products out of spec Take the memory profiles for example XMP has to be validated by Intel before a module could be sold as XMP supported On the other hand EXPO is a self validation process and is an off hands approach by AMD Memory manufacturers can do their own testing and do a self validation and post the results and label the product EXPO certified So it's possible that board partners felt it was OK to also pump addtl voltages to make EXPO stable w CPU How they got those figures is unknown did AMD not give them guidance or validate the process It's AMD's job to provide specs especially related to max voltage etc Maybe the voltages were in spec per AGESA who knows It appears EXPO is not the only thing where AMD is hands off they don't seem to have any validation process in place for board vendors either
Good to know everything is fine over the long course of 3 weeks Wrap it up everyone This is a non issue
Must be nice to have Hubris Insurance Not all of us do
Probably coz this is an initial statement of facts with noted assumptions and an expression of disappointment in the manufacturer's Ideally he would take more time before releasing this vid but the internet moves on very quickly blah blah Resolution and mitigation is not known at this time More work is clearly needed Hence for now keep your Bios up to date keep an eye on temps etc He did start his peice by stating the chances are very low for this to happen Long term impact is still very worrying for me
There's literally nothing they could have done So there's no way for AMD to prevent spontaneous combustion of their CPUs under normal conditions
Outrage sells
Once you get the build at your place the first thing you should do is update the latest BIOS version and monitor the voltages mentioned in the video
Is TEAMGROUP T Create Classic 64 GB 2 x 32 GB DDR5 6000 CL48 Memory CTCCD564G6000HC48DC01 also JEDEC spec I don't see it in your link but it says 1 1v
This is unrelated to AM4
That specific NZXT case pre revision after the riser has been removed and reinserted 100 times with a screw slightly too large
I'm sure there has to be some aio that was known to be leaky so throw one of those in too
With a Note 7 attached
At least that one didn't try to burn your house down with them
You would need those HyperX RGB SSDs that love to cook itself for the true nightmare lol
Get some wish SSD's
Which Samsung ssds In market for a new SSD pretty soon and Samsung was my primary choice Would be good to know what to avoid
Lol just remembered that one when you mentioned it
Galaxy Note 7 as an external monitoring screen
With a Samsung Note 4 charging from one of the usb ports
Which one i just got 970evo plus Don't tell its one of them
Is that the aio that grows algae
Better keep that electrical fire extinguisher ready
I think the beta BIOS has a disclaimer that attempts to absolve ASUS of any warranty claim should something still go wrong unless I m mistaken that alone would make me hold off
i did not know that would this kill laptop battery life what's a good alternative
x200B gif giphy qJ5of2zSNnv2kedeHd
Im now running expo II on the 1303 bios and my SOC voltage is now 1 250 ish or a bit higher
No Lower is better 1 35 is in danger territory and in the video they showed as Asus bios reporting 1 35v but the measured voltage was actually 1 4v
Never did Asus is like razer Overpriced hardware with a giant marketing bubble
Asus is horrible for AMD I've had so much problems with X570 PRO that i've promised myself to never go Asus again
Seems ASUS boards have been pretty low quality for a while Jayztwocents also had problems with ASUS boards recently I think their ROG Strix GPUs are still okay though and still fetch a good price second hand
anymore Never was
Sorry I stopped reading at the Rog rog Rog rog Rog rog Rog rog
The product segmentation based on features and the higher price to get a motherboard with all of the features found on cheaper motherboards from other manufacturers has led me to knock Asus off my decision list for quite a few years now that and their atrocious branding
My first build but I really just sorted by lowest to highest price on pcpp then looked at features going up the list and checked info on that board before ordering This Gigabyte Gaming X Ax board seems good so far but I ll be undervolting and keeping it stock mostly myself so ymmv I d honestly suggest just looking at what s a good value and not worry about brand unless there s a bigger issue like the ASUS thing recently They ll all break something eventually
What you don't like a new level of brilliance and absolute dark power v 9PmGHwllB90 On a serious note yea 100
Yep won t be buying another Asus board the whole point of having the extra controller is that it s supposed to do something not just be soldered on for nothing Fuck Asus
I think the biggest factor is when known people like Steve shine a light on it a lot of times this forces companies to respond Where as without people like Steve companies would more than likely to ignore issues more often
For better or worse Very few youtubers are equipped like Gamers Nexus to even do these kinds of analysis A huge issue is costs and manpower These channels have 20 60 staff its basically a company at this point Even without GN though look at the huge threads on this topic in this sub alone All it takes at that point is tweeting shit at AMD ASUS and a bunch of youtubers will also start to pick it up They might not do the testing but they will sure as hell talk shit because that gets them views So whether its the high road of validation vs the low road of speculation its impossible for issues to get swept under the rug because the media literally thrives on this stuff
People just want to confirm their priors They're going to ignore this part you mentioned
thank you for your detailed response both of my setups are going to include a gigabyte board as well hoping everything is stable by then but if not I'll chill on the expo until otherwise noted
Voltage overshoot has always been a thing everywhere on any board or gpu or anything voltage related This is why LLC and other things exist to minimize account for it Nothing new that some of these voltages increase slightly when stressing the CPU The problem here is really ASS'US applying a massive amount of SOC voltage when enabling EXPO without letting the owner know This is just pure laziness to increase ram compatibility so they can sell their boards claiming highest EXPO compatibility in the world and all of that marketing bullshit Sure there are other things to consider but those things wouldn't even be an issue 99 of the times if SOC voltage wasn't too high which then causes CPU to blow up and failure of said defense mechanisms to prevent further damage fires etc It's a godamn joke and now up to the consumer to make them pay for this stupid shit If I had one of these systems what I would do is when using EXPO manually set voltages myself whilst also account for some overshooting Maybe lower than neeeded and then some LLC to compensate Wouldn't trust any bios vendor at the moment until further clarification
SoC alone may not be the sole cause of this as well The failure may be triggered by a differential between SoC and other voltages The fact their failures point to it originating in the iGPU makes me more suspicious It has been suggested that SoC has to be less than VDDIO 0 1V likely due to SoC supposedly feeding VDDIO APU I believe VDDIO APU is typically tied to the VDDIO MEM value This is all theory territory but perhaps enough of a differential between the supply voltage and IO is triggering a mosfet latchup or other failure in the iGPU and the connection to Vcore could explain why it's so catastrophic I'm curious if disabling the iGPU has any affect on this Many of us pushing the limits of memory overclocking since the beginning have always had the iGPU disabled to be safe Either way it's definitely a good idea to SoC as low as possible and assume the value could be 50mV higher than what is reported I'd also set every other voltage manually instead of relying on Auto Most everyone only running XMP profiles and aren't pushing FCLK likely do not need more than 1 25V SoC if that My 7950X can do 6000 6200 C28 GDM OFF and FCLK 2167 stable with SoC well below 1 20V I stopped stress testing below 1 15V and I'd be hesitant to run much lower than that anyway
The issue with overtemperature protection not being set at the right point for X3D CPUs is completely fucking terrifying to me Zen4 depends heavily on running right up to the maximum safe temperature to get maximum performance and to fuck up something like that on a very temperature and voltage sensitive chip like 7800X3D just tells me that ASUS and maybe the others doesn't care about anything AMD has some lessons to learn here about working with their partners I hope they come out of this as a better company with a better platform When people say stuff like no one ever got fired for buying Intel this is the stuff they're referring to If AMD wants to exceed Intel in reputation for quality they have a long way to go AM5 launch was better than AM4 launch until now but their work isn't even close to finished
Probably they were due to the other voltage rails that are now being capped with the new AGESA it could also be that the other rails were set to a wrong value by AMD initially or they were being altered by the board manufacturers when expo is set I guess a comparison with the Biostar board that was allegedly as voltage happy as the Asus board and comparing how their behavior differs with both expo on and off could help narrow down what other factors could have killed the cpu in the gigabyte scenario without expo
all except Asus are technically under the 1 3v My MSI b650 tomahawk with 7700x is 1 351v with expo on With beta bios it's 1 31v Without expo it's 1 1v
Honestly the situation is just damned I was thinking of switching to another motherboard previously but I realise now I would have been screwed either way
For what it's worth I flashed F5b from F2 yesterday on a freshly opened box with the 7800X3D in the board haven't given up the magic smoke yet I've not enabled or disabled any settings in the bios I ran a couple time spies and installed programs on a fresh win10 install With that said I'm on my laptop at the moment waiting for more bios updates
I just finished building a B650 Aorus Elite 7800X3D system an hour ago so was listening 's an issue with voltages locking down when upgrading BIOS So before you upgrade the BIOS you should first disable any overclocks including EXPO Maybe 5b version currently on the website fixes it we don't know but it does say 1 Optimized for Ryzen 7000 X3D series CPU Which gives me hope
Hey i've built with Gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax yesterday it didn't explode I'm using f5b n bios and it reads 1 025V with auto settings w expo enabled
I have the aorus elite x670 and so far so good Latest bios turned expo off for now Not sure if I can trust hwinfo voltage numbers but they are fine 1 0 1 1V
Just run the thing at JEDEC speeds don't run PBO or do any overclocking and live your life I did a build for a family member with B650M Aorus Elite AX and 7700X It couldn't even run stable EXPO speeds at all with the first couple BIOS revisions then an update finally got it stable Now I'm going to revert to JEDEC and just wait She's not going to notice the slight performance hit and it's just not worth stressing about until AMD and the OEMs can get to the bottom of this which will take weeks
I completed a new build with this motherboard 4 days ago I flashed BIOS to F4 since someone in subreddit said he had most succes with that one I kept everything disabled like expo and didn't do anything else PC is running good but I might check voltages this afternoon because I havent done that one yet But besides that without doing anything with expo it seems to run alright
I've been running the b650 aorus elite ax with 7800x3d on F5a since the chip released No issues and low voltage overall SOC max is 1 24v I think there would have been a lot more noise if it was very common so it's probably just a minor risk thousands of these chips have been purchased and only a handful have died so far
how do you lower it manually by using expo or some other way
erm afaik you can check in your bios if your mobo allows it or check with an app like hwinfo64 or similar
Unfortunately 4800 MHz isn't that fast DDR5 has far higher CAS latency and thus its first word response time can actually be lower than fast DDR4 That isn't everything about RAM speed and the extra bandwidth is big but it is a big ouchie
You're leaving so much performance on the table it's not even funny You are basically voluntarily crippling you CPU's performance And it's not only the speed that's the issue but latency as well You're also crippling your RAM's performance
4800mhz DDR5 is slower than fast DDR4
That's some I'll stay inside forever so I don't get hit by a car logic
What is EXPO even Automatic RAM clock
hahah I feel you i'm coming from 1666mhz ddr3 on my old rig after i build stuff I'm going to wait until everything is confirmed to be stable before i turn it on
they all have dodgy pasts lmao literally msi gigabyte and asus don't know about asrock have all done dodgy things at one point of another
I'm getting gigabyte boards and I've been absent in the industry for several years so I'm not entirely sure on any dodgy pasts
Basically all of them
Every single motherboard manufacturer have had dodgy products Everyone is like OMG GIGABYTE INSTEAD when they literally recalled their Z690I Aorus Ultra oh and the same company that had exploding power supplies And then people swear to ASRock the company with such a shit reputation from its early days with some super dodgy motherboards in their line up It's a roll of a dice

Have a ProArt myself and looking to limit SOC voltage could you tell me where in the bios i find it I did a search but it gave me alot of results Cheers
beta 1410
How much did you pay for asrock board Also asrock is ASUS subdivision or at least it used to before
The Hero doesn t even get to live long enough but still becomes the villain
I have the GENE basically the same power delivery smaller form factor sigh
1401 on ProArt x670e stable as rock no performance drop Vsoc 1 235V down from 1 385V DOCP II rest default Turns out high Vsoc was totally unnecessary borderline criminal
Ruin of Gamers
I've had my ab350m 5 years and it's had a r7 1700 3600 and 5600x in it My nephew now plays on it every night Same story with my msi b350m bazooka I have 2 msi b550 vdh wifis running 1 original and 1 new model and both have been flawless best bang for buck b550 mb bar none
If you go by absolute zero failure rate then you have zero choices left 20 years ago It's always a probability game ASRock is ASUS's more affordable arm but they can offer pretty killer price to performance ratio especially since motherboard performance isn't really a thing I'm on MSI but if you ever used MSI center you'll think this company is run by a bunch of buffoons Gigabyte had some burning boards and PSUs couple years ago However their latest X670E sports the fastest boot time and lowest VRM temps Albeit one of the blew up non 3D boards is from them This is more of an AMD being too trusty on these partners issues No real validation test are being conducted so these partners are running amok
I may be a bit biased here as I'm also the head mod of r ASRock but I use ASRock boards for over 10 years now and I never had any issues which were related to the board itself Typical issues of new platforms aside like memory stuff which were fixed with BIOS updates
Im using Asrock SL X670E with 7950X3D and no issues of anykind at all Just updated BIOS like an hour ago and I noticed some core management improvement Of course just because I haven't noticed problems doesn't mean there aren't or won't be any in the future Everything works fine for me except the Gigabyte graphics card Aorus 7900XTX Coil whine above 90 FPS and shity software to control fans and RGB I guess Gigabyte just suck these days
Ive had asrock boards for years now The quality wasnt good back in the am3 days But their am4 boards i havent had any problems with they are good value too Have only had good experiences with their support as well
asrock asrock was spun off from asus their working culture attitude might still be very similar with asus
Very happy with my Asrock X670E PG Lightning and a 7900 non X Chrome runs well with 24 threads winking facethumbs up SOC voltage is well within specs on the last but one UEFI firmware update for that mainboard
Have four ASRock boards Two 350m pro4 and two 450m pro 4 All still working Also have an Asus ROG x470 Working great as well The ASRock boards have a 5600x 3400g 2600x and a 1600 l Edit 450m 5600x and 1600 350m 3400g and 2600x X470 5800x3d
i have asrock motherboard and its pretty good and works without issues z790 pg riptide
Assrock tend to cheap out on component quality the most Wouldnt trust their boards with anything but a budget cpu
Anybody got experience with asrock I have an Intel Asrock Z690 Steel Legend and it had the same issues this Asus one has of throwing too much voltage at the cpu though not as bad I made a post here with my findings But to their credit I've never had a more stable system everything just works even though I configured voltages to be as low as possible which tells me the MB outputs very clean power
B550 AORUS PRO V2 checking in Zero issues after a year and half
I'm currently very happy with my Gigabyte B550i Pro AX with 5800x I did initially have an issue with fan rpm speeds on one header not reporting into the BIOS and desktop the fans spun but no numbers reporting but two years later and a couple of BIOS driver updates and it's all good
MSI may be trash never had problems but it was the only option with BIOS Flashback i don't know if it still is
MSI is good
They're all going to have issues here or there If not now then later and they have in the past one way or another It's mostly just finding what's working best for a current product line
My old Phenon II Asus board is still going as a friend's HTPC although last year it needed a oven pass at 220 C to go back to work it melted the CPU bracket but the cooler is working fine with just the gravity holding it But yeah nowadays I would choose Asrock over Asus any day
Things die like that and isn't an indictment of anything Shit happens man You basically went had bad luck they bad brand
I haven't had a main AMD build in a long time but my Phenom II board also did the exact same thing Luckily the place I ordered it from had a 3 year warranty and covered the board under that and after that PC I had an Asus z170 MoBo die the same way Have been on MSI boards since with 0 issues
You mean when ASUS followed AMD's guidelines only to find in their testing the guidelines were inaccurate Unfortunate reference According to Asus AMD's guidelines state that the cooler should be mounted with a pressure between 30 to 40 PSI However after thorough testing Asus has found out that the optimal pressure should actually be between 50 and 70 PSI In short the screws that hold the beefy Strix cooler in place aren't tight enough text According 20to 20Asus 2C 20AMD 27s 20guidelines between 2050 20and 2070 20PSI text According 20to 20Asus 2C 20AMD 27s 20guidelines between 2050 20and 2070 20PSI
Reviewers should refuse to enable EXPO specifically on ASUS and not others
Asus actually went as far as to add that stupid EXPO may void warranty message to their newest BIOS Source on that I'm looking to buy an AM5 board and some Asus boards looked good for my needs but considering how important memory speed is on Ryzen and how AMD recommends using 6000MT s speeds which means EXPO if Asus voids warranty for that they are out of my list of potential boards
It's a bit of a catch 22 On one hand yeah it's reasonable to not cover someone who didn't know what they were doing butchered an overclock and screwed up royally On the other hand motherboard manufacturers built their brands to what they are now on the backs of gamers and overclockers There are real world reasons that Soyo Albatron DFI ECS Shuttle Abit and so many others didn't survive or mostly fell into obscurity while Asus MSI Gigabyte and ASRock not only survived but now completely dominate the market There are real world reasons why everyone boasts about 105c Japanese capacitors bajillion phase VRMs debug LEDs 8 10 layer PCBs and accessible clear CMOS buttons There are real world reasons XMP and EXPO exist instead of everyone manually entering in timings and voltages for that stuff like we used to None of those reasons are because of marketing We demanded this stuff after years of garbage hardware ass build quality and big dust ups like the capacitor plague debacle There are real world reasons every single major tech hardware manufacturer wants a slice of the pie employ staff dedicated to that purpose and constantly boast about some new feature or utility Plenty of us were overclocking and tweaking our PCs long before manufacturers actively supported it and they started supporting it because it made them billions of dollars to be associated with it At some point they have to take a little ownership
amd sold the things at damn near cost so a lot of people bought them for the great value and room heating
Anus
I'm in the same boat as well I really am hoping that its just as the Gamers Nexus video describes and that all that is required is a hard upper limit of 1 3 Volts being set on SOC voltage and the re enabling of some over current protections to bring everything back in spec I like my AM5 system as well I owned only Intel systems prior to this one and I really want this to work out
Probably not Though honestly you are probably fine If I understand correctly the X3D chips are more sensitive to this and most of the chaos we've seen so far are when it was blowing past 1 4v
CPU degredation could mean months taken off up to like a 10 year lifespan for all we know
Nah non X3D chips aren't that voltage sensitive I've had multiple systems go through my hands hitting 1 37 and none of them had issues Obviously a few years later I don't know if they're fine but at the time they were I've worked on a 3600 system that hit about the same and that worked well You've probably nothing to worry about
New cap is 1 30v so that should be perfectly safe I just lowered mine to 1 25v because of the comment Steve made in the video I may even try to lower it to 1 20v tomorrow This is all just an abundance of caution for me at this point
AFAIK HWMonitor has been rubbish for AMD processors since Zen 2 unable to report on cores in sleep state without waking them up HWINFO64 is the recommended tool
You're probably fine now If you have EXPO on and SoC is 'only' using 1 24v then you're likely fine As Steve mentioned there's more to test learn but this SoC voltage seems to be one of the focal points
I have CPU VDDCR SOC Voltage under the CPU section then CPU VCORE SoC under the motherboard section so I'm partially confused
CPU vcore SOC
Finally some sense people are 's Without actual data it is nothing more than worrying conjecture and hearsay It sucks that this shit happened at all but that still doesn't mean we should continue the speculation Just keep an eye on your stuff and deal with whatever comes thumbs up
AMD fucked up on the regulations part not telling board vendors what is safe and what is not safe which could have prevented this entire ordeal to some extent board vendors though did not use fancy shit they soldered onto their fancy boards hi asus with your fancy OCP which was set improperly and kept cooking CPUs with 440w of power after they are already dead kept lying and trying to sweep problems under the rug hi asus again i remember why i talked shit about your boards since 2007 and here we are again had multiple bugs with reporting off of voltages and applying said voltages which means anyone trying to check voltages in UEFI or HWINFO64 was lied to and would need to physically check voltages inb4 those who bought a 5800X3D were smart
Actually if HWinfo is to be trusted with its reporting with that RAM running DOCP on Asus Hero and BIOS 0805 which i presume qualifies as older Agesa my vsoc is 1 25v That said AMD no doubt fucked up
The vid says EXPO doesn't set VSOC So if you manually set it to 1 4V yes it'll be at that kinda a weird point to make
I have 7800X3d and mobo in my closet because I'm still waiting for my cooler But now im considering 13700k even if its weaker in games
Yeah sitting with 5800X3D here thinking I have almost the same performance without blowing up the CPU and MBO Thanks AMD
I have a 5800x and am satisfied It's great I don't see a point in fixating on cutting edge or the best of the best since you'll always be chasing that dragon It's best to find happy performance
I'm right there with you with my 5950x I bought off of hardwareswap for 350 usd back in june
Right now here in Canada the 5800x is about 270cad
Should I get the 5600 or 5600x There's any relevant difference
Picked up the x3d a few months ago the feeling is mutual
i got one of those in the early days of zen 3 seeing this shit has me not regretting it
Can almost only be done on AMD side haha but good advice
A solid choice I'm planning on running my 5800X3D for probably the better part of the next decade much like my old trooper 3770k I've been extremely pleased with the X3D's performance Question is do I get another 32GB kit while prices are cheap for DDR4
just return the asus board and get a different vendor ASRock and MSI both seemed to be doing good in the tests
Nah intel is brute forcing their way with no innovation and super beefy CPUs Ryzen 5000 is the way to go
Lol I built this PC in 2018
Agesa Sorry I m not familiar with bios terms cuz I never really touch it aside from turning on xmp expo
I have the exact board Cold boot times are 53 seconds With memory context restore it s 26 seconds Boot from sleep is 7 seconds width 1508 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 48ff5d6d45c8d757e9692ffba5dbca05efa1e7c0
If you don't enable the Memory Context setting in BIOS the boot time for me at least is around a minute If you do it does shorten the boot time quite a bit for me it makes it down to around 30 seconds Idk if the amount of memory affects it as in if 64GB takes longer than 32GB but I'm currently running 32GB 2 x 16GB so not bad at all IMO
Yeah SOC is set at 1 25v What about cpu vddio mc
Link to specific video or guide
Even with a miscommunication Gigabyte's boards shouldn't be doing crazy shit
You missed the point he tried to make that silicon lottery is also involved Aka weak cheaps will have this cascade effect So it's not an issue for those with better silicon Note how there is still only a few documented cases of this rapid disassembly People are not grasping that its not affecting every cpu out there Probably also the reason why this didn't get caught in QC like GN mentioned If my cpu fails it fails and I'll just rma it through the seller I'm not gonna het consumed by the fear for if I have a weak cpu that is susceptible to this cascade runaway issue
Nice cope if AMD communications were at fault why is this issue limited to just Asus and Gigabyte
Ok thank you watching the vid rn even if I don t know anything about pcs plan on building my first pc early may
Definitely agree
Ah the classic I had no problems therefore people on the internet are blowing them out of proportion
Ive owned 5 zens and rmad two of them 1700x and a 5800x Zen has been cool and all but the next time i do a platform upgrade ill definitely buy intel Id gladly trade some power efficiency for stability and peace of mind
but when I switched to a 12700k there was no major issues besides the default power limits being set to unlimited on most boards I mean it's overclocking in everything but name and warranty effects but it just tells the CPU that it shouldn't stop turbo boosting unless it hits thermal limits
Exactly very well said
Yeah GN however releases more of this info to the public and are unbiased so they can torch whoever fucked up Individual companies are biased
This is true but I guarantee you that only GN will report all their findings while the rest will report the least and in a way which covers up as much of their faults as possible
Yep
You can see which one's the correct one here also mentioned in another post here post 29183137 It's the 'CPU VDDCR SOC Tension SVI3 TFN ' entry under ' CPU 0 Enhanced
i mean with GN
For me it was the 3900x I had so many whea issues and bios issues in general I switched back to Intel with the 12700k No issues since then other than having faulty ram which I replaced
Anecdotal evidence I had zero issues with my 5600X not even those USB problems And I've heard way too many reports of unstable XMP with DDR4 and 12th gen That's a lottery for both AMD and Intel
Yeah Zen 3 launch was rocky to say the least usb randomly unplugging and repluggling was an issue for more than 6 months I feel like the last stable launch was Zen 2
Same thing with intel gen 12 You are gonna beta test no matter if it's intel or amd
Not to mention the fTPM stuttering which still hasn't been fixed for Zen 3 mobile
Oh man those WHEA errors
I went AMD because at the time intels new big Little architecture was having issues and bugs
Using a 5800x3D now aswell the news about the L4 cache with Meteor Lake does sound quite interesting Lets wait and see what will happen mid late 2023
I ran into most of these concerns too pre CPU go boom concerns I may be pissed at them but I do want to be fair to them so I'll run down what I know Boot times vary by mobo manufacturer supposedly some have fixed some haven't I am on an Asus X670E A board and they broadly resolved it with the Memory Context Restore option in the BIOS I believe most vendors have this by now Without it I have worryingly long boot times to the point I get concerned that the system is bricked With it my boot times are faster than ever from off to Windows in 5 seconds with an NVMe boot drive Not entirely sure what you mean by the GPU numbering My knowledge of RAM timings is you absolutely can tweak them for gains but honestly I haven't touched my RAM settings beyond enabling EXPO and I am getting such performance that I don't feel the need to Also not sure what you mean by the requirement on a low level BIOS button The chipsets are kind of annoying but broadly a future proofing concern The E variants have PCIe 5 0 on the GPU slot but no one is making PCIe 5 0 GPUs as of writing They do support PCIe 4 0 on them as well so current GPUs quite literally won't be able to tell the difference between E and non E The 670s have more total PCIe lanes than the 650s more lanes are always nice especially if you plan to potentially add more drives or add in cards to the machine later but if you don't intend to do that then according to my understanding there isn't much need to worry about that X3D is absolutely gaming first productivity second unless you happen to know your specific workloads like extra cache That's really up to you and what you intend to use the machine for If productivity is a big part of your plans for it definitely look into another AM5 chip or Team Blue
why
Or hear me out buy Intel and not have the problem regardless of whether you win the pick the right board partner shell game
lol you guys hold so much against Intel yet every time I had an intel CPU it lasted ages First a Pentium 3 450 mhz literally had that for five years that system never went bad Then a Q6600 lasted forever survived half a year of running with badly mounted cooler outlived its use Then i5 4590 still in my backup pc works great Cost me only 230 bucks at the time Over eight years old Now an i7 9700 three years old and going strong not a single issue since installation I'll happily go intel again because everytime I went with them their CPUs were just great for me perfect stability and durability Never any issues with ram or xmp never needed any bios updates for anything on any of those processors mentioned besides the z390 for 9th gen compatibility You can blame Intel for being anti consumer but at least they have an excellent history of solid CPUs even during their monopolistic position
AMD is very skilled at that it seems
After having bought an RX 5700 XT that throttled itself out of the box and a 2000 3000 series CPu that wouldn't work correctly unless you had a specific power plan
AMD needs to come out and say if anyone's chip dies prior to X date a month or so past healthy BIOS they will give a full refund for CPU Consumers shouldn't have to worry about a CPU offing itself for a engineering failure
I think it s time we started demanding that they re a bit more transparent AMD especially has a problem with ignore deny downplay followed by vague acknowledgements followed by mysterious AGESA fixes or if they can t mysteriously patch their way out a replacement program Love or hate them Intel and Nvidia are a lot clearer in their communications react faster and provide some notion of root cause analysis And this isn t just a consumer side problem AMD presents the same behavior at the development and enterprise level it s lot easier to get an answer for a multitude of scenarios out of Intel and Nvidia than it is for AMD This is why I think ROCm is in such crummy shape underinvestment and not having appropriate communications channels with customers Frankly a lot of this probably stems from AMD s success being a post Zen phenomena they spent much of late 2000 s and 2010 s as a cash strapped also ran on the verge of collapse so they simply lack the internal resources and processes to handle these scenarios properly As for Asus they ve primarily banked on relatively high quality manufacturing processes while grossly underinvesting in support services and enablement software whether that be firmware drivers or user land value adds like Armoury Crate which as a low level software tools developer is baffling terrible in both architecture and implementation Granted I know Asus operates under huge margin pressure but they could probably make their lives easier in relatively short order by dramatically slimming down their product portfolio and investing in full rework of their bizarre software stack s Finally just a little effort on the support side would go a long way I ve gotten lucky in 25 years of using their boards for both my builds and others I ve never had to contact them for support But I know people who have and what was described was pretty terrible My main machines use AMD Zen 2 and 3 CPU s 3800x and 5950x on Asus boards For my needs AMD s CCD s with symmetric core types is just better than what Intel s currently offering mainly because I don t want to deal with analyzing test scenarios running threads on substantially disparate core types that s not to say there s anything wrong with Intel s as Raptor Lake is seriously impressive it s just not ideal for what I do That said I m really tired of always waiting for the other shoe to drop with AMD they re in the big leagues now they need to start acting like it
Thanks bro
No I follow the previous posters point of view and are quite put off of AM5 A general feeling of very bad QC was becoming apparent with a lot of bugs mentioned Its never entirely possible to eliminate bugs but you shouldn't be finding a list of them trying to track down a specific issue It's a failure of process that's far more concerning than the fault itself
or you can lose 100 of the performance once the CPU blows up
HUB did a memory scaling benchmark and for a 7950X3D chip running 4800CL40 only loses like 5 7 performance compared to 6000CL30 HUB Memory Scaling Benchmark for 7950X3D v XW2rubC5oCY 7 game Average 5200CL40 is within 2 of 6000 A 7800X3D would theoretically show even smaller losses since everything is covered by vcache And obviously if you don't have an X3D chip things will be worse
Whats the proof of this 10 15 loss
Which is for most games still enough I bet
It's a little EXPO related every motherboard is running more voltage with EXPO enabled But it shouldn't be an EXPO issue the issue is the motherboard not respecting voltage limits
Oh wow thanks for the write up That actually did help Also what a mess If I had one of those CPUs I'd try to nuke it right now so I could get a new copy
Damn I was hoping this issue wasn't across the whole 7000 series
Using an Arctic Liquid Freezer 360 AIO
yes the upgrade i wouldnt
Who knows what that high power is gonna do to some chips in years time
Yea I love the efficiency of the chips but a 13700k will be safer and ok I'll have to upgrade my motherboard again sooner but my last CPU and motherboard lasted 6 years
This is sadly simply not true I updated to the latest BIOS and now it's not booting with EXPO enabled anymore Instead of the 6000MHz my Ram should be running at it's now 4800 Nice Or really not so nice Can only hope that there will be a future BIOS release that fixes this issue again otherwise I will have to figure out how to fight return policies
I want to but when I'm spending so much money on a new rig it's so risky compared to a intel system that doesn't have these issues it's a shame as I wanted to go team red maybe I'll change my mind I have a month to think on it
There are no reports of ASRock running 1 3v on their SOC
I mean Gigabyte had an issue as did Biostar but Asus is a premium brand and they're also the ones with most issues I'd understand if it happened to some new partner with no experience but this is just orders of magnitude worse
You own an Asus board
I can t speak for their Motherboards but the RMA process on EVGA products is phenomenal in my opinion I ve only used EVGA cards and EVGA power supplies strictly for years Sad I ll have to find a new route on that front eventually Though I m fairly certain they are specifically high end boards though and they don t make mini Itx boards either which is what I need Everything else that can be EVGA is
Didn't the RX6000 have very high VRM and memory temps
It so weird that multiple motherboard brand is having the same issue that u would think Amd gave the ok signal for it Not at all as the video explains AMD's guidelines said that SOC voltage shouldn't be over 1 3 So exactly the opposite of giving the okay on that
When it takes 2 videos to cover everything wrong with AM5 then i pass
This is AMD and the board makers f'ing up so i'm not sure what is safe at all
Intel did F up bendgate was a thing Intel's fail only affected boost clocks though it's been a while since Asus killed Intel cpus X99
the way i see it stuff like is the tradeoff of using bleeding edge enthusiast technology instead of unremarkable entry level stuff and it was fixed in days nothing short of catastrophic failure on a 60 scale with no possible resolution will make me switch platforms tbh it s the life i chose
Honestly that second point is a much bigger sin Combined with the fact that productivity on x3d processors is like buying a chip from 4 years ago the fact that they fooled people into buying the 2 more expensive chips one that costs 700 only to then revealed the 7800x3d be even faster than those to but costing less is no short of an open scam But this fanboydom gives AMD a pass for literally anything They're still here trying to shift all the blame on just Asus or attack GN for even covering this
yep
maybe they should though the biggest problem with AMD right now are the QA
Cool I'm sticking with AMD
I thought so too after the recent video from Igor from Igorslab But in this video Steve says at 35 50 that the SOC clamp down is inadequate as a blanket fix which I interpret as a not it's not solved but addessed prevents dmg to components But given all the engineering terms I am kinda lost what problems exactly remain can that be addressed by a BIOS update and which are negated not sure if that's the correct english term by the 1 3V clamp
Plenty of known issues on the drivers and often rdna3 owners straight up gaslight as though there are no driver problems with rdna3 It's pretty scummy how AMD fanatics lie so much to pump the company
yet mobo maf played fast and hard with intel spec mobo for their
Why is it clear
Yes he pulled the fire alarm and incited panic Just look at the comments on this post Like I said it s a disservice to the community Amateur investigative journalism AMD MB manufacturers will have this fixed before his next video on it making the incompetence on many levels comments hilarious
Yeah I saw that definitely going to be doing all of that I haven't know to do this in the past now I know
I got the memory in and CPU Z shows all the various timings tables as JEDEC HWInfo shows my SOC voltage as 1 191V now I did have to play around with the BIOS settings because selecting the memory profile it would set the SOC voltage to 1 24V but when I set it to Auto and RAM to DDR5 6000 it listed SOC as 1 10V Of the benchmarks I ran most of them were fairly close The game with the largest difference was Shadow of the Tomb Raider DDR5 600 CL30 1 35V DDR5 6000 CL48 1 1V Shadow of the Tomb Raider Min FPS 173 159 Max FPS 347 301 Avg FPS 240 216 F1 2020 Min FPS 235 231 Max FPS 292 293 Avg FPS 262 257 GFX Memory Speed Benchmark Peak write SYS RAM 25 53 GB s 25 61 GB s Peak read SYS RAM 29 61 GB s 29 08 GB s Cinebench R23 17 090 17 023 Time Spy Extreme 6 510 6 526 Unigine Heaven FPS 97 1 on Both Score 2447 on Both Of course my benchmarks don't compare to actual review sites because I never go for Ultra settings and I cap my CPU at its base clock speed since I live in an area where power can be iffy so I want the UPS to hold up as long as possible before the computer shuts down I'll stick with the DDR5 6000 CL48 1 1V for now until AMD and the board makers can get their setting sorted out
It seems to fall between the fast standard and the common standard based on what's reported on Anandtech because people want faster CL memory not fastest JEDEC compliant memory I'll run some tests after I get it in and swap it out with my EXPO DDR5 6000 CL30 memory
Nah that riser was a faulty design right from the start
Putting a leaky aio in an otherwise combustible PC might actually be a safety measure
EKWB's first the early revisions of the Predator series were notoriously leaky However they made a final revision that fixed all the issues with much better build quality and even a more expensive CPU block after pulling the whole lineup off the market just to take care of customers with leaky units so it may be hard to find a leaking time bomb by now
But u can still use it on the Ultimate Nightmare build also Msi water cooler so it s guaranteed that cpu will fail and overheat rolling on the floor laughing
They have all been fixed by firmware Just make sure they are up to date once installed
980 pro iirc and it's been fixed with a firmware update
980 and 990
Imagine if a company was so nefarious they would release a Trojan horse to eliminate the problem but said horse absolved them of any 't do that right
Hwinfo64 afaik
I had just posted ITT that I was seeing HWiNFO64 is reporting 1 35V on SOC and HWMonitor reports 1 394V 1 403V for my ASUS X670E E Gaming WiFi with BIOS v1303 when I saw your comment So I rebooted into BIOS and SOC was set to Auto and was reporting 1 394V next to that field WTAF So I flipped it to Manual and put in 1 25V and it's now reporting 1 25V in HWiNFO and 1 305 in HWMonitor while running CBR23 What blows is previously when I first built my rig in early February I was getting 29 200 scores and since the new BIOS came it's down 1000 pts the best I've gotten was 29 670 Granted these are 1 2 deviations but pffft Latest score while typing this was 28 289 which is a hair above the reference score for a 7900X Peak package temp was 88C which is 1 2C lower than usual DeepCool LS720 360mm AIO with fan profiles set for as silent as possible If I were to turn everything up to hair dryer loud I can shave 5C off temps Not worth it
Ye i was on 1202 for a while damage is probably already done
They didn't used to be c I remember a time before ROG they had very reputable products for a fair price Marketers ruin everything
It's very frustrating that they hold the patent on hot swap switches in gaming mice SO much e waste created because they make it impossible for other manufacturers to add this consumer friendly option
ROG ROG ROG has like 100 500 dollar premium for mobo and GPUs lol
I'm curious is there's a brand that is the opposite of this
I built my computer when Ryzen first came out and used an ASUS board to start with The motherboard bricked itself when trying to update the BIOS which was required to get the better RAM speeds Took that one back and got a Gigabyte whose back panel audio didn't work Took that one back and got an MSI and haven't had any major issues though their Live Update program is a UI dumpster fire
Asus Prime models are the perfect example of paying premium price for bottom tier hardware Of course their multiple 700 board offerings don't impress in value either I remember when the VERY POPULAR Crosshair VI Hero was MSRP googles 255 when it was brand new so we have come around 3x the MSRP in the span of one platform lifecycle I hope everyone just stops buying their stuff until their prices come back in line with the industry and the industry average price is still pretty fat
I think that's an issue for ryzen 7000 cpus and chipset Not us with am4 Shouldn't have to worry
More like ROCK because it becomes unusable after it blows up amirite
No prob been working out the details myself here while trying to plan out an upgrade if I even go forward with it Under the circumstances tho I'd also probably be going with Gigabyte or MSI None of the vendors are faultless here but Asus in particular has really not conducted themselves well here At least Gigabyte's OCP and PROCHOT worked
Be aware that gigabyte will also set the SOC very high with expo I am running a 7700x with 6000MHz EXPO kit on B650 Aorus pro and it defaults to 1 35v SOC with EXPO I turned it off and am waiting for more info for now
Just watch your SOC voltage and you will be fine If needed just set manual values below 1 4V Gigabyte boards have a bug in which they send 1 4V by accident
Sorry all I care about is controlling the color of my fans ROG liquid cooler pump from Armoury Crate
Certainly possible though GN noted VDDIO was unusually low at least in this pool of tests but I think you may be onto something about the iGPU The public statement from Asus was a little funny in that they more or less said well you can OC the RAM just not the CPU so we boosted the SOC E nor does it have a thing to do with EXPO So that's weird Disabling onboard graphics or any onboard thing I don't need is one of those old school things I still do but then I still tend to disable spread spectrum too
Yeah I'm real curious as to what other rails are being addressed here and how I'm also curious once the new AGESA rolls out to everyone if benchmarks might differ The other thing I haven't seen here along with more on the Biostar board is a look at some of the non X3D CPUs I seem to recall at least one 7900X or 7950X cited
Biostar has a reputation for being Ali Express tier anyway and I doubt their board costs 700 lol
The specific values will differ depending on EXPO profile so my note about under 1 3v is sort of insignificant other than to highlight Asus pushing it to 1 41v despite the setpoint being 1 35v and that some use cases exhibited burn out even though they were under the SOC threshold stipulated by AMD
Ok thank you very much I ll check in the morning and probably update my bios too
1 cas doesn t matter 2 it affects a bit more than the first word 3 the timing will increase not decrease 4 bandwidth is still limited by fclk 5 it s 2400mhz not 4800mhz
You know what really cripples performance A dead CPU Can't even get 1 FPS with that
It essentially allows you to run your RAM at the advertised speed If you buy DDR5 6000 it'll run at the base JDEC speed unless you enable EXPO in which case it will try to run at 6000
yeap asrock and gigabyte seems to be ok but asus really royaly fucked up
yeah avoiding mobo companies with a shady past basically includes all of them lol
thats the thing about asrock it was shit during their early days because they were part of asus once they left along with pegatron from asus grip asrock started to release decent offers
Just finished the video and it sounds like it is absolutely their fault Setting Expo should have no bearing on chip failures It's the motherboard manufacturer setting a high SOC to hopefully improve ram compatibility when expo is enabled Then on top of that having OCP over current protection not work at all That's what I got from the video Please correct me if I'm wrong
Yeah welcome to the EU and shove that statement where the sun doesn't shine Asus
Beta builds have appeared on the ASUS page since forever with this same disclaimer at least since I had my X370 Crosshair VI Hero
So they don't provide warranty for the beta bios that supposed to stop their motherboards from destroying CPU Their disclaimer only hurts them person shrugging light skin tone
I won't be buying Asus ever again
Uhh didn't they take down their older bioses and upload this aka this is the only available one Good luck refusing warranty under those circumstances
under AI Tweaker Ignore the CPU offset I'm doing I'm mostly testing if that curve optimizer has any positive effects on undervolting
If you watch the video you realize that its certainly possible its not even reporting your SoC voltages correctly anyways
ASRock is owned by Pegatron a company that helped beat and arrest its own workers who tried to ask for higher pay There was some connection between the three a long time ago but not for at least a decade now
When I upgraded for an Intel 12th gen I initially went with an msi board it came with a full cover block which was sweet I receive it GPU not recognised update the bios it got bricked contact ekwb i bought it from their online shop they very kindly RMA it I receive the new one still doesn t work A local pc parts shop helped me debug it because I thought that my cpu I bought from them must be dead No it s the board not being compatible with RedDevil 6000 series a known issue Got a refund on the board and bought an ASUS proart which is great It was so bad that the people at ekwb told me they were having non stop issues with the msi collab board Let s just say that when a big gpu brand doesn t work on a big motherboard brand I am not trusting their testing any more
They were spun off twenty years ago Yeah We're old now
Asrock fatal1ty series back in the day was amazing
Really AsRock are known for good PCB and components and then taking ages to sort their UEFI out Reviews such as this highlight that Components here AM4 gid 2112472504 gid 2112472504 AM5 6hv8sPs edit gid 0 gid 0
So what are we left with
Asrock has some of the most overkill am5 boards for each price bracket
ASRock boards tend to die after five years or so
Gigabyte call it QFlash have had it since at least the AM4 5 xx chipset
lmao they applied guidelines for a reference cooler and were surprised that they weren't accurate for their own custom cooler that was a copy paste job from an Nvidia GPU Yes that's exactly what I mean
Yeah so Asus boards constantly get dragged through the mud because of poor cpu performance
It's all over Reddit for example warning on rog b650ef 1414 when enabling expo However I got it wrong about the may void warranty bit The message doesn't actually mention warranty it just says not guaranteed
Yes but in the video rn though the HWInfo reads 1 35V but the actual rainy from Steve's voltmeter is 1 4v
Memory controller degradation is a fast process Even Intel CPU's die in weeks a few months with to high IMC voltages What 7 months of this issue with normal CPUs and 2 months with 3D variants means for lifespan is something we might see hear in 6 12 months from the current users
the panic in this thread is wild
1 2V works for my 6000 cl30 CB23 went up 200 points with the lower SOC too
I stress tested my 7950x3d at 1 2 yesterday Seemed to work fine
I lowered mine to 1 2 v on msi the day MSI announced their initial bios revision last week and while I don t do specific stability stress testing for ram it hasn t had any stability issues at all even in more ram intensive games
What are the drawback of using lower v I also notice that X670 mobo has double the power vs B650 thats why most X3D chip die is on X670 initially Do you have X670 or B650
I went to 1 15
Sorry yeah I used that I just turned off EXPO and now i'm getting this
'm getting this is this okay
ah whoops you right the mobo one is the source of the voltage and what the bios setting affects the cpu one must be a sensor in the cpu i think it's a little bit lower due to voltage drop right now mine is set to 1 25v in the bios in hwinfo under mobo i see 1 270v and under cpu it's 1 245v
Cpu vddcr SOC voltage my friend
That's speculation that AMD didn't communicate specifications Board vendors can absolutely ignore AMD specifications or even on the BIOS side just send the AMD firmware that everything is OK because it's the board vendors responsibility to implement controls properly If the board says voltage is X but it's actually Y how is that AMDs problem
AMD fucked up on the regulations part not telling board vendors what is safe and what is not safe which could have prevented this entire ordeal to some extent Maybe it is like this but I am skeptical they did not The most probable fuck up was to not implement a shadow of a verification process to guarantee the standards were followed
AMD fucked up on the regulations part not telling board vendors what is safe and what is not safe which could have prevented this entire ordeal to some extent I think it's more likely that AMD did absolutely tell them but they never locked it down in the AGESA itself allowing the mobo manufacturers to simply ignore the safe values and put whatever limits they wished
Which RAM are you using What timings did DOCP set of your sticks
EXPO sets the VDD and older AGESA sets said VDD as VSOC too Try it on your AM5 board of choice
At higher resolution it doesn t matter as much cuz u will be gpu bound on games
If you remain uncertain and are still with in return window you can return wait for some more info and repurchase I don't think you'll have any issues repurchasing it as inventory seems to be a bit more stable depends on your region It also gives time to see how board partners and AMD handles this situation Otherwise slap it all together update bios and hope that all remains well and have the warranty give you some peace of mind
Bless all those early adopters for doing all the beta testing And back to gaming with my 5800x3D
My 5800X3D machine that I built like 2 months before the new ones were released is feeling pretty damn good right now
Just go for the 5600 put the extra 20 towards more ram better psu case fan or a cooler
Gamers nexus has a video on that the X doesn't do much if anything
Second hand 5800x3d would be my pick
that x makes it resell better when you buy them on Launch if you are planning to upgrade them soon or they are place holders they are practically the same price you might as well get the better binned one for 10 20 extra I was debating getting an used one for 120 but almost snatched an openbox 5800x3d for 250 so im waiting a little more Same as the XT and non XT GPUs they are the first to have huge pricedrops Im upgrading my gear now and sell as quick as I can since once 7600xt drops old gen is going to drop hard 6700xt went from selling for 450 to 289 in a few short months
Yeah especially MSI seems to rock abide 1 2V limit on SOC what is like max recommended voltage limit for SOC Not even LLC causes it to increase much beyond 1 2V
WTF dude Built my last PC in 2022 Before that 2014 And before that 2008 What do you do for income
AGESA is the base build for all BIOSes which vendors use to build their own BIOS
v dlYxmRcdLVw
I missed nothing
Its not there are cases of MSI boards also burning If 3 different vendors have the same issue its probably amds fault
Also from GN comment section x200B width 766 format png auto webp v enabled s 9a8a64361333d6d4beb07059fdf0b7172621d283
They are most popular AM5 models
It's clich d cause it's true
Appreciate the response What about the Core VID for the 7950x3d Is that acceptable to be over 1 35 for all cores at max
rolling on the floor laughing
Wanted to move from intel 11400 long time overdue to amd 5000 series usb crap was happening which would have ruined my pcvr experience Still waited for new series really wanted to go amd Wanted to move to 7000 series i was just waiting for mb prices to drop No way in hell i will do it now I will just buy a 10850 probably losing pci4 and thats all And i was thinking that poor cpu was temporarly is working hard from 2 years ago
The problem with 5000 series was that not all cpus were able to run sweet spot IF frequency 1900Mhz
Alderlake was rock solid in my experience The only real issue was that early ddr5 boards that were 2 dimm per channel basically everything that isn't an OC focused board or itx were awful in terms of stability If you use an Alderlake cpu on z790 or a z690 Dark it's a lot more stable
Specifically what was the beta testing with Alder Lake
I've never had issues with Intel but I was on 10th gen
AFAIK the only early Alder Lake issue was Denuvo and all of those issues were solved 2 months after release
Nah
lmao as if Intel doesn't have issues Apparently X99 was a nightmare And the motherboard manufacturers have caused problems in the past But ASUS is a whole other level of special here
Lmao nope I used to have an X99 PC before building my Zen 3 PC Well the motherboard I had MSI X99S SLI PLUS had the tiny little issue that two DIMM slots were faulty Friend of mine had an identical PC and he had nonstop BSODs He replaced that board with a different X99 one and it all seemed 'g done Guess what With XMP enabled the PC would not post period So let's stop pretending that Intel is some silver bullet against hardware issues Both have had their great series and their bad series that's it
It's just different priorities I think using the force of a monopoly position to force competition out of the market is worse than some problems with a product itself you don't and that's fine That said I never had problems with AMD CPUs before Zen either and Zen Zen 2 I could understand them being behind in quality due to no budget but there is no excuse anymore
As a dev I'll tell you this every software has a ton of bugs most of which are masked so you don't notice them The fact that this is out in the open now means there are ways to mitigate or fix them This also is backed up by the fact that fixes are already released moreso with the fact that Steve said it's a hard to reproduce issue This literally had less occurrences than the 12 pin cable issue Nvidia had with 4090s
If it blows up i return it we have consumer protection laws in germany
Doesnt matter if its enough If i wanted last gen performance i would have bought ryzen 5000 or 12th gen for significantly less money Now i get last gen performance for next gen price I have a 4090 i am constantly cpu limited in games as it is with a 7950x and 6000 cl30 This will decrease my performance by the full amount where as with a weaker gpu you might not notice
Who cares if it is enough
That's not the point The point is that you buy RAM intending to run it at advertised speed whether that be through XMP or EXPO Not doing that in order to avoid this issue is not getting what you paid for on the RAM side of things Turning off EXPO isn't a solution it's a workaround
It s literally stated in the video that EXPO does not change the SoC voltages at all so no it s not even a little
I have no idea the 7900x could maybe not have anything to do with this issue but just wanted to put it out there since it was similar damage
well is more easy to remove xd
Actually the 13700k is insanely efficient and unlike the x3d chips it works as a multi purpose processor that has comparable professional workload capabilities to its gaming performance unlike the x3d chips
B650e Taichi 7800x3d expo timings Max is 1 24 in hwinfo after hours of p95 gaming cinebench 3dmark I have pho enabled and of at 20 boosting to 4 85 all core and 5 05 single Taichi was a lucky choice
I know I'm just saying it's not as simple as just dunking on Asus I don't really have a satisfactory answer from this video as to what exactly is happening We've got an idea of what went wrong with the Asus board we don't have answers for Gigabyte or MSI yet
I haven't heard this on RDNA2 The 5000 series had some really poor AIB cooler designs AsRock Challenger and ASUS had a horrible one with awful memory VRM contact while others were good and the reference 5700 XT were blowers which wasn't ideal The AIB GPU designs are more on AIB partners and their coolers than AMD 5000 series was pushed super far past the performance watt sweet spot and you could undervolt clock to drop power by nearly 20 with 3 performance loss I had one the Challenger and it surprised the hell out of me So even if you had a terrible cooler there were ways around it not that that's an excuse for Asrock and ASUS
Exactly so why did multiple motherboard brand went over that This is a really weird situation
So you are getting rid of the 4090 There are more than 2 videos on melted connectors
I'm on Asrock right now and I feel a lot more comfy after watching GN breakdown each board's default Expo voltage I also tested and monitored my own voltages via software and it's working just fine On the old bios it's possible to mess up the voltages but at least it's not easy as Asus's issue where setting expo just goes overboard
They literally can't though without threatening breaking partnership or whatever
I think what Steve means is that the lack of hardware protections on the board and the CPU that cause this are still present but clamping SOC down will block the current catalyst for this But if there's a different glitch or fuckup that results in SOC being 1 4V or if the user does it themselves this issue will still occur I'd hope mobo makers add a pop up for the user setting 1 4V that says Hey dude this is a really really no good terrible idea and you should revert this change unless you want silicon for breakfast Overall as long as the user is on the latest bios you'll be fine
To fix it set CPU turbo to OFF is good 50
That 100w idle power draw with 2 monitors is supposed to be fixed any day now and it's also not a big deal anyway Heat is good in winter AMD is looking out for us Thank you AMD
These problems are happening to multiple mobo vendors which indicates AMD is doing a poor job of communicating their knowledge of the 7000 series 3D cache CPUs' limits to them I'm not trying to say the mobo vendors aren't also at fault They are also contributing to these catastrophic failures in their own ways
AMD MB manufacturers knew this was comming Where is their communication to get ahead of this Instead I think they prob trying finding ways to blame eachother I don't disagree with you though Just different angles and nothing is known for certain FYI I currently have a new system being built as I type this

oh oops that's the one i use haha
Your missing the point your board may be holding at 1 35 just fine You wouldn t know unless you did the same testing they did soldering leads to the VRM Also your specific CPU s tolerances matter as well You could have a 9 10 related to CPU quality and a 7 10 MoBo and it will never be an issue The problem lies in the lottery style nature of silicon and parts we build with The main issue that is a real concern is the OCP not performing after a shut down then subsequent start up in the 00 state they showed But that s only ever in play if you re system reaches a thermal critical point or over voltage fault high enough to trigger the shutdown I don t think their video was properly organized it seems like everyone is still stuck on VSoC when it s just part of it They could have edited it much better to lead with the primary points and broken it into parts
That is correct Asus used to be a go to guy to buy a reliable and cheap motherboard Now It's a joke you can find equivalent motherboard for half the price minus what I like to call marketing features nobody ever uses And don't get me starte on their awful monitor Some IPS panels cost more than Alienware QD OLED They beyond joke now
I don't know I'm sure that's probably true and I was just unlucky but I had 3 ASUS mobos in a row back in 2010ish that were defective and one that was DOA Then I had an ASUS laptop and an ASUS monitor that didn't last a year I'm aware of their reputation but I've been wary of them since the motherboards That said I think my current motherboard is ASUS
You'd think that but around 2008 before ROG branding they straight up told every RMA'er to F off when they sold garbage boards I gave them a second chance with Ryzen 3000 series only to find they had a whole sku with non working Ethernet ports that they were doing nothing about ASUS will forever be a shit company in my eyes
Agreed Asus was reliable for a very long time Their AM5 500 mobo I ve got is the first time they really disapointed me
Other manufacturers could probably license it they would just have to pay a little money for it and consumers mostly wouldn't be willing to pay an extra 1 for it probably
The 400 premium on the the RTX 4089 4090 STRIX models is absolutely insane
Brands never stay the same Asus used to be cheap and reliable AMD used to be joke in gaming CPU space everything shifts every time that's why brand loyalty is stupid Every gen will have a good well priced product For AM4 it was x570 tomahawk that offered what Asus did but for 100 less This time around I'm out of the loop so I don't known Definitely won't take a choice upgrading when my options are bending intel CPU Vs burning and CPU
Yeah I checked just in case since I've seen people with ASUS AM4 boards post screenshots of 1 4V for core on auto but I guess mine is fine
ROG Brix now that I think about it the Gigabyte Brix mini PCs may not have been the smartest marketing choice
Still have to watch the SOC voltage though Gigabyte is still sending 1 4V by accident
There seems to be a bug on Gigabyte BIOS that doesn't revert to auto settings even if you turn off expo or load default settings after setting EXPO on earlier this was edited out by GN because it's another issue and will be covered by a later video You have to manually set it to a safe voltage just to be sure
I think it would be safer for now to assume that they are all vulnerable as the 7900X v arDqhxM8Wog that was sent to Der8auer probably was the cited incident had similar damage in the same area plus a 00 POST code on a gigabyte board albeit expo usage was unknown
It would hilarious if it had better behavior than the Asus one
With this mentality you might as well buy a console Actually no Don't buy any electronics because dead electronics cannot serve you
Oh so a 5200 cl 40 wont run at that stock lol Thanks Looking to build a new pc
So basically XMP as with Intel
Gigabyte screwed up too Their BIOS allows for setting of 1 4V by accident
The latter is most concerning as the board just sat there sending 36 amps to an already shorted out cpu
Yep sounds like the extra money people pay for OCP doesn't protect shit and instead goes directly into the pockets of ASUS execs
Keep in mind this also happened on a gigabyte board where board itself didn't die and voltage was fine hence Steve will do a follow up after investigations in a lab are done There are probably big upsies on both sides BIOS at least you can modify and rectify but if 780x3d have engineering defect that will be a big off from my understanding CPU as of now is a ticking time bomb it might die in 5 minutes or in 2 years If they find anything that will rekt the resale value
Correct but separately Gigabyte F5a bios has a bug thats not setting values correctly potentially causing excessive voltage differential and runaway thermals
boards still ship with the shady one that explode stuff and you break warrenty if you update to the shady beta hmm
Cheers mate i checked mine on auto and it was apparently edging 1 37v so i dropped it to 1 28v to see how it goes as im still on an somewhat older bios but had been stable
yes these are the defaults with uEFI 1410 Manual setting 1 25 and vSoC goes up to 1 305 with prime95 and small FFT's
I didn't come here to be attacked like this
Oh shit
Nothing Pick your poison Asus is budget hardware at a premium price Assrock is even lower quality at a price reflective of that Msi and giga are a diceroll gen to gen Just wait 6 months after a product launches honestly by that time any major issues will be uncovered and you can base your decision on that
If my boards make it 5 years that's a good indicator I'm way past the point of an
And source for that
Yeah that tracks last time I bought a mobo was in 2019 msi B450m mortar and I needed the flashback
they applied AMD's guidelines for the 5700xt they found these guidelines were inaccurate was the amd die significantly bigger than the nvidia 2060 die no the nvidia die was nearly twice the size AMD 251mm vs nvidia 445mm in effect that cooler was overkill and still failed due to ASUS following AMD specs for 5700xt
Thanks but yes it's not the same at all
It s warranted when you spend a significant amount of money and nobody outside of Steve is offering any sort of real answers and even then it makes you consider if your system will randomly catch fire or just die prematurely just because you followed what you paid for
first the 4090 adapter now this
This It shifts more socket power budget to the cores and lowers heat output from the IO die I have more than 15 000 machine hours running SOC 1 2V with ddr6000cl30 and perfect stability
do i just enable expo 1 not expo 2 and then use buildzoid's timings and then also set the SOC to 1 2V anything else just built this past week will this also work with running eco mode at 105W i already set that under PBO
I have the same setup as you What is your Vcore and VDDCR VDD at
Lower voltage is generally 'better' as long as things remain stable More voltage to a point helps makes things more universally stable but it seems some manufacturers went a bit overboard with it I'm on a X670E and it seems MSI has it set to use the new cap of 1 30v when I have EXPO on And it's probably doing that to more 'safely' keep my system stable with EXPO on I'm just choosing to try and manually lower it to see if it stays stable at even lower voltages
lower voltage might destabilize ram if you're trying to overclock it otherwise should be fine
In nutshell The higher voltage the easier it is to tell diffrence from 1 high voltage to 0 low voltage as states will have more diffrent values Also if you have like 2 cables very close to each other assuming they are not covered in insulator If voltage is low electricity will not flow between those cables in reality small amount will flow but very very small Moment you apply high diffrence voltage you will see sparks all the time between cables as electricity will jump through Extreme example is lightning extremly high voltage that jumps from sky to ground Also voltage increases power output power is proportional to voltage 2 in simplified circuits So in simplified circuits you can expect twice the voltage 4 times the heat In reality it is even more because of current leakage that increases with higher voltage and fact semiconductor resistance increases with heat so you have to feed even more current for that resistance So voltage can be good if you are overclocking and have great cooling and trying to break records but even if you are get your voltage low as far as you can just enough voltage to keep system stable In fact undervolting can often increase your performance because let's say your CPU is limited to 125W TDP and it reaches 125W TDP at 4 3GHz But after undervolting that TDP will be reached at let's say 4 4GHz That means performance increases The reason why mobo manufacturers often increase voltage is because well the higher voltage the more stability technically speaking so less RMAs because something is unstable out of box But it does affect longevity and heat negativly
Asus X670E Hero and 7950X3D on Bios 1401 and I am getting similar voltage 1 020 with stock settings
Yup That SoC number is the one that's getting a lot of attention The new BIOS's should cap it at 1 30v which should mean 1 30v is perfectly safe I manually set mine to 1 25v I have EXPO on If I turned EXPO off I get a similar number to what you have It's entirely up to you if you want to turn EXPO on at this point or wait a bit I could argue if you are risk averse that it may be worth waiting a few weeks to re enable it after all this gets a bit more sorted
Mine says 1 015 I disabled the EXPO in bios and left everything as is Bios v 1212 on a B650e f using a 7900x from the Microcenter bundle
Realistically Gigabyte and Asus fucking AMD stuff up isn't new In fact I'd say that's the standard lately lmao But I do agree AMD needs to tighten the reins on the partners that have been stepping out Asrock seems to be doing fine given their long ass partnership with AMD I'd fucking kill for some Sapphire XFX or Powercolor motherboards though
AMD fucked up on the regulations part not telling board vendors what is safe and what is not safe which could have prevented this entire ordeal to some extent We don't know that to be the case I am pretty sure that the CPU's would have been supplied with information as to what was safe and what wasn't or at least it should have been I would also expect AMD to be doing some validation on the boards to ensure that they comply with those requirements Did you watch the video Steve made it pretty clear that AMD communicated some must specifications as should without properly conveying that violations could be catastrophic I'm sure it can be confusing because he talks about different bits and pieces in different places but he also makes it fairly clear that he talked with people who had first hand knowledge of the situation he had schematics that aren't publicly available and multiple times he referenced statements from insiders who weren't comfortable being named Not a big leap to realize these are likely engineers at AMD Gigabyte and or ASUS
Gskill trident z5 neo 2x32GB 6000 30 40 40 96
I play on 1440p 165Hz gpu is 3060ti at the moment
I had a very nice 5600X based system but had to leave it at home when I moved to another country It then made little sense to me to build an AM4 based system from scratch so I went for AM5 after they gave a discount that made them more appealing than Intel that I was initially considering Now I'm thinking that building a 5800X3D based system from scratch would probably be the best idea That way I'd have a cheap and mature system with one of the best gaming CPUs and little to worry about Oh well let's hope that this issue is crazily exaggerated as it usually happens
A minor perk is the possibility of it running cooler in a SFF case cooler setup I think I saw a 3 drop vs stock using 45w eco mode but the thing couldn't break 70 on a nothing cooler
Hey man just mind your business
Hi do you mean you have long boot times at every boot or is it just that first one after changes
Thanks I see where he changes the vdd soc voltage to 1 25V But I can't find that on my gigabyte board I see vcore soc but I'm unsure if that's the same value with a different name face with rolling eyes

Sorry that I can't answer Here and in general it's only stated that the VSOC shouldn't be over 1 3V ideally capped to 1 25V
Funny but shockingly true
Big Little in the very early days was a bit of a beta test though on desktop it wasn t particularly bad It was not so great on mobile though since Alder Lake possibly has some idle low power consumption issues that seem to now only be somewhat resolved with Raptor Lake and Alder Lake refresh
CPU wise untill this incident AMD has been on par with Intel since Zen For GPU's I belive the RMA rate is still 2x tht of Nvidia etc
It had scheduler issues expecially on windows 10 and issues with older games including some that would just not boot at all
Guess which brand board I
Not just apparently My MSI X99S SLI PLUS had faulty RAM slots meaning that I couldn't run 8 DIMMs I found out that day that a slew of those motherboards had DIMM slot problems and that getting a functional one amounted to a coin toss A friend of mine had one too and he had nonstop bluescreens He ended up swapping it out with a different X99 motherboard and everything was 't running his RAM with XMP so I told him to enable it Guess what With XMP enabled the PC simply would not post period

What is being seen here though isn't really masked bugs It's out of spec behaviours that with a proper test regime should be being spotted I can't imagine it being impossible to run automated test setup for each bios config point and read off real analog board data e g VSOC and verify it is working properly then move onto formal release masked bugs or not I'm an embedded software and test equipment engineer so to me this just looks like a tremendous fuck up that should never have got past automated have automated testing
Point I ordered a system myself but it's really off putting with the boot and stability issues Yes there are those who have none of this but I really want the piece of mind that I'm not dealing with a bug that may or may not be worked out later
Thanx Just put the mem on 6000 and adjust voltage manually
Last gen performance for next gen price That's a slogan alright
Yeah they just mean that you need to use it as a work around for a few weeks not permanently For the time being it seems like an easy way to prevent any danger whilst having reasonable performance in games until there s a BIOS fix
See and here we differ I am fine as long my 6200 ram runs on 6000 within the next 12 months You want it immediately I bought AM5 for the future so I can gain more performance the next years while you limited with Am4 once you bought it in 2023
Yes for some weeks it is never said anything else
watch his testing at the 29m mark it literally has an EXPO on off chart where he shows every board has at least 0 2V with EXPO on except ASUS which of course fucks it up completely by pumping 0 4V Maybe you should go back and listen to what was actually said he said the EXPO setting doesn't explicitly raise SOC voltage But that doesn't mean the manufacturers aren't raising VSOC when EXPO is turned on
EXPO itself doesn't change the SOC voltages but SOC voltages need to be adjusted by the board to work properly with it There's a chart in the video from various manufacturers All of those tested but ASUS increased it from 1 1 2V while ASUS goes up to the dangerous 1 4V All Steve was saying there is that it's not like DRAM voltage on AM4 when you turn on DOCP always 1 35V because it's in the profile So the EXPO setting is ultimately on the mobo makers
That's valid I appreciate the info
No it s the entire 7000 series 3d chip are just more common to this issue cuz it s apparently more fragile than the regular X chip
The 13700k isn t as impressive with gaming though is it
If I'm following the timeline correctly MSI put out their announcement claiming that they resolved the issues pointing to beta bioses out since 4 14 That tells me they were ahead of everyone else putting out rudimentary fixes before the drama even began
They really have to start working hard on energy management My brother has an 3600X and i managed to drop the voltages 0 1625V Energy draw only cores fell from 80 85W to 48 50W with no performance impact I believe AMD improved it for the 5000 series but damn the 3000 could have been a lot better Every chip is different but at least try to adap to it's capabilities
They are used to overvolting on previous AMD and Intel platforms so they saw no need to break a habit would be my guess Unfortunately for them this chip is more sensitive to voltage
The case with the 4090 was user error in all cases So it was a video about user error both the connector and the cable were and are okay I don't know how you're still saying this
Im just returning it and staying on the 5800x3d until things are figured out
there is a will there is a way it is not the unbreakable laws of physics
What I find weird is that this would mean that mobo manufacturers dont do a single on the edge of max voltage run No stress tests whatsoever Like how they are not catching this in their prototypes and first revision QC and stress tests Otherwise they would have caught it and were up on AMD like wtf
What to do this is exactly my point As an owner of these products wouldn t it be great to know if this is fixable through bios software and what you can do until a fix is released to prevent your comp from blowing up
I'm using a Ryzen 7 7700X and a 3070 I see that Team Group released cheaper DDR5 6000 CL48 1 1V memory 94 for 2 x 16 GB sticks
Get a case with a QI charger built in and throw a Galaxy Note 7 on it Slaps top of case this bad boy can fit so much fucking fire in it

Hey better safe than sorry
asus back in the k6 2 days was so good
That is correct Asus used to be a go to guy to buy a reliable and cheap motherboard Asus used to be the fast but unstable motherboards while Gigabyte motherboards were slow but stable AF Asus used to win a vast majority of motherboard benchmarks by a few percent back in the day on stock settings Intel and AOpen as a subunit of Acer motherboards were somewhere in between ASUS and Gigabyte in terms of performance and stability MSI as Micro Star International and Biostar were budget motherboards that you avoided unless you had no other choice Asus did go through a phase where they were the first to have entirely automated production lines for everything which meant that their boards were usually higher quality than everyone else but then they went overboard into the branding and major product segmentation instead of quality and features
A few years before that they had a bad run of boards and blamed every RMA on possible overclocking and refused everyone's RMA to try and get out of it They really haven't changed
Well fuck me for buying a Asus laptop thinking they were still a reputable company Guess I'll see what happens
Every motherboard costing more than 300 will disappoint me There's no justification for a consumer socket board above that price range except for extreme overclocking which no one in the mass market will ever do
Amazing that some people actually buy them And it's not like those halo pricing markups are offsetting cheap entry level options because ASUS isn't the cheapest option at any tier
And they mostly have coil whine
ASRock seemed to be far ahead with value for part of the AM4 era now they seem generally competitive with MSI and Gigabyte as they've become more mainstream
How do you set it manually Sorry im a noob but in my bios gigabyte f5b soc vol auto is not even changeable its greyed out
Lol wtf Thanks for the heads up I will set it manually Edit so I m actually on the f3h bios which I don t think has the same bug GN mentioned with the f5a bios I turned expo off then rebooted and checked SOC using hwinfo and it shows 1 1 now
You may be right and I'm just thinking of Der8auer in which case I think he outright said he deliberately killed that one Could've sworn users had also but even if not with all the shenanigans better safe than sorry
We're not talking about other electronics We're talking about CPUs and MOBOs that have known issues where they pump way to much voltage into the CPU when a certain feature is turned on Hence why Infrah didn't turn on EXPO
No though 5200 CL40 is already really slow for DDR5 standards Right now 6000 CL30 is looking like a sweet spot
Pretty much
I would not expect all of the used ZEN4 CPUs to last 10 years at this point
It's normal to have overshoot on set voltages specially at load This is why you have LLC options and even account for these things when setting a set voltage It's been like this forever and it will continue to be so Just bear that in mind when doing things Set a lower voltage and apply some LLC to stabilize it around the value you want
Yeah there is the voltage set and then there is the actual voltage applied after Load Line Calibration This is not the first time of boards having improper LLC setting by default
In the past I have only had positive experiences with ASUS but their pricing is unreasonable
A good board should reasonably last me eight years
Small n but it kept happening with me and my friends
A 5700 XT is a GPU it does not have mounting screws and therefore AMD does not have mounting pressure specs for the 5700 XT What they do have is pressure specs for AMD's 5700 XT reference cooler design AMD did not design the Asus Strix cooler so they have absolutely zero responsibility for it working or not Different cooler designs require different mounting mechanisms If Asus tried to use the specs for AMD's cooler to mount their own cooler design they are incompetent I can't explain it any more simply than that
Not the same but still a really stupid move on their part to add that message just right when this issue popped up A lot of people myself included would not even read that message because their stupid legal shit detector would prevent them from doing so and they would just assume oh it's Asus covering their asses here in a really stupid way I mean it's not like XMP DOCP EXPO was ever guaranteed to work but it's now that they've suddenly decided to add that message Given the historic context it reads more along the lines of EXPO is not guaranteed to work and never was but now that it also may blow up your CPU we've decided to mention the former without actually mentioning the latter
steve literally says in the video to not panic because this testing was above and beyond the scope of normal use cases to intentionally try and cause failure but i still get your point
No need for Expo That is what Buildzoid's setting are optimizing better than expo Look at curve optimizer too
Dram Vdd at 1 35 vddq and vddio at 1 25 Vcore auto but co 30
Well my feet got so sweaty watching that video so I think im going to keep it at 4800mhz expo off for a while hahaha
Possible to turn off EXPO and do manual OC for Memory just like My AM4 mobo which I disable DOCP and do manual oc which works with safe voltage
What cpu did u have before the 7800x3d
AM5 in generally have long cold boot times Yes every boot Some mobos are shorter gigabyte and some are longer MSI
When he's going through the bios it basically goes the same order on ASUS and Gigabyte boards Here's mine
Bad mod bot I was just linking the free text version of the guide
Nvidia has always been my go for GPUs They really screwed up the 40series pricing Think I'll keep my rx6800 until the next gen is out
It had scheduler issues expecially on windows 10 well then my upgrade to Windows 11 immediately after the CPU upgrade wasn't a bad idea after all
I agree the issues here are fucking awful but better that we know about them than not I've a oided buying Asus as much as I can and I've recommended the same to others since from what it seems like they just copy pasted the 7700x profile and pissed off Their automated testing if it was configured properly would've failed on multiple steps it is fucking weird that even consumers knew about the voltage sensitivity but Asus never bothered to implement it
But if you turn off expo it doesnt run at 6000 it runs at 4800 CL40 which is slow as fuck I use a 4090 i am constantly cpu limited This will cost 10 performance in basically every game i play because only very few can max out the 4090
I guess on raw avrage benchmarks it isn't as good as the 7800x3d in games and the 7800x3d costs 50 more so maybe for pure gaming and objectively then it's not a match BUT it really comes down to what GPU you have what resolutions you play at what other use cases you have and how often you need to upgrade x200B Not for nothing but the 13700k is not something I would call not as impressive since it does even beat the 7800x3d in something like Warahmmer III And in 1440p or 4k neither of those CPUs are going to be any different with 120hz screen with similar lower 1 results It's just that the 7800x3D would probably do better againts the 13700k in let's after 3 4 years 3 4 years is when I would consider upgrading anyway x200B But all in all if it's not a purely gaming PC then the 13700k is the clear choice at 50 bucks less for better productivity
There s somebody in this thread who has an MSI board with vSOC at 1 35V It doesn t matter if you get to it a a week earlier thousands of these boards have already shipped with older bios
Mate you're just bouncing around and moving goal posts at this point You've hit like 4 different topics so far and have been repeatedly refuted For one thing I genuinely do not believe you on that undervolt for another that last 5 10 of performance requires exponentially more power The voltages are also set early on and silicon quality improves over time Given that Zen2 and 3 mobile were outstanding in efficiency I don't think it's an issue
A few years before that they had a bad run of boards and blamed every RMA on possible overclocking and refused everyone's RMA to try and get out of it Was this during the great electrolytic capacitor scandal where capacitors were dying left right and center due to a Chinese company stealing a formula from a Japanese corporation and manufacturing a ton of substandard electrolytic capacitors that were used in almost everything as a cost saving measure
There aren't a lot of good alternatives for gaming laptops and they're often competitively priced I wouldn't hesitate to buy an ASUS if I was getting a gaming laptop Maybe Lenovo in second place for me When the competition for quality and value in laptops is Dell and HP it's easy to look good Motherboards are more competitive and ASUS just doesn't offer quality or value to justify the price premium at every tier Strix GPUs are just as bad you can get a whole midrange ASUS gaming laptop for the price of a midrange ROG Strix 4070 Ti
I had an asus 1050 laptop and it served me good since 2017 I gave it to my sister in 2021 she still uses it
That known issue is so fresh that it has milk dripping from it's mouth and it's not even wide spread Furthermore it was fixed Crippling performance out of fear of destruction is pure paranoia because you can apply the same reasoning for any hardware
Hmm i cant find any motherboard that supports that hifh speeds hmm
I think that's very unrealistic especially as parts gets smaller they also lasts shorter time due to sensitivity
you explained it fine all it looks like to me is poor specs and QC from AMD its almost like a common theme
I get what you mean but it's still fundamentally different from them saying it would void warranty If I activate EXPO and the mobo gets cooked that difference becomes critical
Copy that He marks VDDIO MC for 1 35V My Trident Neo Z5 specs for 1 4V which one should I use
No harm there A few points in performance gains isn't worth your sanity
i5 4690k I still have it slightly smiling face
Thank you I'll give it a shot
That card will last even longer probably
Not a fan either I have a 4090 RTX for VR but if I did not play VR I would probably have picked up a RX6800
Windows 11 had fairly significant issues with games around that time as well It even still has issues I would check your Bios and see if VBS is turned on or of when on some games loose up to 10 performance
Yes I understand that and I want it to run at 6000 but I am okay waiting some weeks to have it stable run at 6000 without burning anything And again everyone can add his her own risk assessment it doesn t seem that expo or anything is unsafe anymore with the new bios
I mean it will be for a 120 hz 4k screen and a 4090 would a 13600k be a better choice It s going to be mainly for gaming would a 850 watt psu still be enough
vSoc 1 35 wasn't the whole story The fact it can spike past 1 35v to 2 3 4v and up is
Yup I believe it was the tail end of it I absolutely despise ASUS for it I did grow up and give them another chance but they still can't seem to do right when they screw up The dead Ethernet port on 3000 series Ryzen thing again turned into a blame game for no reason I had looked it up and it was a common issue that people had kept chat logs so others could get thru the process faster
EXPO is overclocking so it's natural that the specs are lower than that But just like it was with XMP DOCP in the DDR4 era it's essentially a form of overclocking every gamer has to do anyway to have performance anywhere close to benchmarks It's the unofficially recognized sweet spot what matters not the specs For DDR5 with the Ryzen 7000 series it's figured out to be around 6000 CL30 Higher tighter than that instability risk increases
Computers have gotten more reliable while node size kept shrinking I see no reason why this would suddenly be reversed Also the silicon chipset generally isn't even the reason why motherboards die it's usually other parts like capacitors and VRMs
Yeah you're exactly the kind of Dunning Kruger genius Asus were preying on with that press release
I started with his 1 35 but read the VDDQ and VDDIO should be 0 1 less than VDD so tried it and it worked and stable and lower is better Start at 1 35v get stable and then optimize
If you aren t using a 3D chip it will be a lot of performance left on the table
The 4090 cost more than my entire build I'll probably never be able to afford one face with tears of joy
I m not turning off security features just for some gaming performance
If you already have the 850w it is in the safe area but if you're buying one new then I would personally go for a little bit more than 850w purely for efficiency and safety But if you've already got the 850w then the 13600k would be okay in there throw a sensible power limit in there and it's all good x200B As for the other thing the 13600k could theoratically be 5 6 less performant than the 7800x3d at 4k BUT that's a skewed results in favour of games that are not CPU bound and are running at very high referesh rates Generally games that run under 120hz would be hardpress to show you any difference at 4k with any of those processors t 521 t 521 x200B I would say you'll be good with either the 13600k or the 13700k The 13600k would be considerably cheaper than the 7800x3d as well But then I would probably upgrade in 2 4 years x200B And one more thing if you don't need the iGPU go for the 13600KF 13700KF slightly faster and cheaper
not even that the fact that asus board allowed 440w worth of power to be fed thru the already dead CPU further cooking it and deconstructing it into layers i swear ASUS is somehow always the clown fest whenever there are issues which is why i avoided their board for very long time still remember my M2N VM DH spectacularly failing and almost setting my house on fire because VRM's took a shit
Ok thanks Still confused where the limit is at Like the motherboard has a maximum limit but then the actual RAM has a maxium oc limit but im guessing not all RAM comes equal but i cant figure out what each RAM vengace fury etc OC to max on EXPO Or is the EXPO profile on the motherboard same for any ram
They are not getting more durable or reliable really there is a reason why mission critical stuff usually is run on older hardware
Thank you for your opinion Have a nice day
i tried 1 35v on MC stable tried 1 35 for VDD and VDDQ stable then tried VDDP at 95 and VDD and VDDQ both at 1 1 wouldn't post and had to clear cmos and start over Right now i've got MC VDD VDDQ at 1 35 and left VDDP on Auto I noticed that the DIMM's spec for 1 1V on the VDD and VDDQ so curious why that wouldn't post In HWinfo it says Module Voltage Nominal Operable Endurant at 1 1V for VDD and VDDQ
Yeah but non x3d aren't as sensitive either so generally more of a non issue there
Yea hence proving the point about Windows 11 having issues with gaming
This is what I put together on pc part picker any adjustments are welcome d go for that considering I d prefer less power and thermals due to me being in a small room I m upgrading from a 6700k would I still see a big improvement
Just shove some pennies in the fuse box and charge double the price ASUS
If you look at the spec of an AMD CPU you see this nbsp Max Memory Speed 2x1R DDR5 5200 2x2R DDR5 5200 4x1R DDR5 3600 4x2R DDR5 3600 This is the limit which is considered non overclocking Then motherboard spec sp will have another limit Support for DDR5 6666 OC 6600 OC 6400 OC 6200 OC 6000 OC 5600 OC 5200 4800 4400 MT s memory modules Then for example this RAM module spec tab tech specs has a speed rating of DDR5 6000 and also has AMD EXPO performance profile What that tells you is when you put that RAM on a motherboard and enable EXPO the motherboard will read the EXPO profile on the module in this case DDR5 6000 and all sort of voltage and sub timings sees that DDR5 6000 is supported by the motherboard and automatically set the speed voltage and sub timings to run at that As this is above the CPU limit of DDR5 5200 assuming 2 DIMMs this is considered overclocking but if you believe AMD this is a combination that should work because the module vendor tested it and wrote it into the EXPO profile Still doesn't stop AMD from claiming this would void your CPU warranty because you're running it out of spec though And also it might fail to overclock this high because of motherboard variations so that's why motherboards have list of support RAM modules on top of these Also EXPO does not tell you whether the RAM motherboard CPU combination will overclock further For example you can try to manually set the speed to 6400 tweak the voltage and sub timings carefully and it might be 100 stable It is just not done automatically and there is no guarantee that the next identical kit you buy will still overclock this high
It's more because such chips take years to be validated Even mission critical stuff eventually moves to newer processes it's hardly been stuck on 180nm since forever
I left VDDP auto and VDD at 1 1 is way too low
It is a massive issue lol Idk what you are smoking 20 or more performance That s a generational uplift
seems like you've done your research this is all solid specially the Arctic fans I'm not seeing a cpu cooler here but I guess you already have one which is probably good enough for the 13600k x200B Not a major thing but I would personally go with the WD BLACK SN850X for the NVMe option It's considerably better than the SN770 that you've picked the SN850 is one of the best if not the best option at the best price for its performance It's a little more expensive but you could try a cheaper motherboard like the MSI PRO Z790 A instead of the MAG to balance the price a little Both motherboards will be okay I have used the Z790 A and I don't think you'd gain or lose anything Just the z790 A tho not z790 p x200B And yes the improvment from the 6700k to 13600k is a lot for the money you'd pay Just make sure you're using win11 and not win10 as win10 doesn't have the newest software requirements for the intel 12th and 13th x200B How power hungry is the 13600k x200B it has a max turbo of 181w out of the box but you can easily bring that down from the bios in MSI is under Advanced CPU configuration to a much lower TDP and have CPU that sits at very low temps all the time with similar to out of box performance
Basically everything has tanked
NVIDIA is down 42 since November AMD is down 44 since November and Intel is down 52 You re acting as if it s just AMD that took a beating recently Hell generally speaking everything is down
A year ago was the covid crypto peak This year both GPU and CPU markets are in a slump crypto crashed ETH went PoS FINALLY and there's ongoing stagflation as well a recession on the horizon
My brother in Christ it's all down
AMD Q3 2022 had a revised forecast of one billion dollars less revenue than expected AMD client division tanked hard which probably means that desktop laptop OEMs reduced their purchases of CPUs and DIY is not making up the difference Currently the stock market has extreme volatility in this recession so any bad news means crash and burn for companies AMD had bad news so speculators are dumping This past month Apple Adobe Nike Meta formerly Facebook CarMax and others' stock prices got crushed when they released bad news Also that graph's peak is speculators piling into AMD stock as well as the money printing inflating the stock market AMD did well in 2020 2021 when there was huge demand for PC parts and PCs so speculators drove the stock price up The massive growth was unsustainable If you look at stock price pre COVID 19 money printing in 2019 the current price is more representative of the reality of the situation
BUY BUY BUY
Tech stocks across the board where pumped high a year ago It s a pretty common trend I m amd is still in a great position enterprise wise since intel imo is not quite in a good enough spot to actually compete I expect that market segment to grow and let s be real general consumers that build machines or buy laptops and what not to be down significantly over the next while Covid basically made everyone who wanted a new machine and can afford it upgrade at the same time It os very unlikely that group goes up more ever again With that said amd is doing pretty good for chips in other devices so that is a place I would pay more attention Think PlayStation Xbox steam deck Samsung phones and ect That s how they will get in consumer devices more going forward
Everything is down champ
Macro macro macro
Fed has hiked interest rates past 7 Credit suisse and Deutsche bank are in questionable positions that are giving Lehman brothers vibes based off the information at hand The Chinese releastate market is collapsing not to mention the bank pretty much scamming people by saying their checking and savings accounts could get higher interest but went ahead and invested it in risky shit so people can't get their money back Then the evergrande failure and Chinese nationals have 70 of their savings in real estate since it's lucrative Then to top it all off you have mortgage relief and rent relief programs from covid expiring causing people to foreclose and getting evicted And the fed interest rate hike I mentioned earlier is literally meant to try and cool down the labor market even though a million people died during covid Then the ukraine war and a possible WWIII situation Everything is shitting the bed and I think in amds earnings call they're predicting that they aren't going to be expecting any turnaround soon but they have cash reserves which is good for them But holy cow is a lot going on
Have you seen the SNP It's not just AMD everything's down
Rates supply chain tsm wafer prices high the general macro economic environment The ryren7000 series is impressive but expensive and sales is unlikely to drive AMD Strictly for this new series their previous zen 3 stuff will probably do well for the coming years even if its old gen Their acquisition of xilinx was questionable they spent a lot like 10x Dont quote me on that to acquire them supposedly by quite a bit and people didnt like that so it tanked almost a whopping 15 i believe i think it ended up landing 14 down i forget at the time of reading this There's quite a number of reasons im not sure which one weighs in more but frankly others like nvda and intc arent doing well either AMD might still have a future might it will probably your decision is urs and urs alone Im optimistic and will only buy small amounts since everything is on sale but thats just me mostly betting on AMD doing better once ddr5 pricing cools off and once their 7800X3D chip drops i have a feeling it might be an intel killer Prices of GPUs like the older gen and the 30 series have dropped a lot so its completely possible that any future chip beyond what we currently see in their 7000 series can carry amd forward but thats hard to say definitely
Recession incoming and no one wants to forklift upgrade a perfectly good system right now
Because the stay at home time is over people are back at work and spare income to spend on pcs is being spend on Energy and gpu mining finally died When shit slows down only things that do well are food energy and O FUCK what we do
It's nice seeing tech companies being hit by a reality for once Covid era has ended Cripto is basically so i think we'll see some price normalization in future months
What rock should I mail the notice to that all stocks are tumbling
Don t follow stocks I take it EVERYTHING is down and has been for a little while now
My brother in Christ every single stock has gone down significantly in the last year
CEO announced that they will miss expected earnings and it plummeted immediately
Massive energy crisis in Europe Nobody is thinking 'jeez I better buy a Ryzen 7000 series'
Have you been in a cave for the past year The entire market is on discount right now
Gonna go buy some AMD stock now Thanks for the wakeup call I really should take the opportunity to start investing
We're in a recession
The US has banned chipmakers from selling to china to try and slow down China s AI development that is a huuuge market
Just keep buying the dip there's more movement down lots of economic uncertainty right now but if you're a long term investor then don't worry
Because stocks have nothing to do with actual performance of a company but just the perception Stock price also has nothing to do with the company Unless the company issues more stock they have zero connection to it anymore
Want a bad good news It's gonna go down 2x from current value
They ve missed last week recently and the the whole semi industry is affected by macro conditions Am an investor it s been a crap year
Because we had this pandemic that forced everyone to work from home so everyone had to buy reasonably powerful pcs for home that could do all of their work stuff A lot of people got into streaming and people had way more time for gaming too so all of this pushed demand for not only PCs but high end PCs unusually high Everyone who was going to get one ended up with one countries opened back up and people went back to work so demand went down and now the bean counters across the tech industry are doing a collective surprised Pikachu as they thought that this massive covid demand was going to last forever and the markets are throwing up in disgust in response
one of the biggest reasons is how Tech finances itself Tech companies typically finance their operations through loan even if they have money The interest rate on corporate finance has more than doubled This has mad operations balloon in cost along with the general rising of wages in America It isn't that AMD is bad or Intel or nV 't seen enough financial data released yet to see how each of these organizations is handling their preferred financing methods be stripped from them Nor have we seen how any of the alternative methods have handled Thus many people and orgs are locking in the huge gains they had during the Covid years This isn't the only
Their stock was overprice due to hype and groupies trading Still pretty overprice right now there is not much room to growth any more A company with 6B revenue and 94B market cap is stupid
Rising interest rates
From what I am hearing is that a recession is occurring or is about to occur
Because we're in a bear market and likely will be til the end of the year
The whole market is taking a beating you can even check amazon and apple or any other big well doing companies to realize what is happening
everything is down
Economic conditions with rising rates and AMD was already massively overvalued just like NVDA was and still is
Because JPow fingered every assets class not just AMD
Boys those chipmakers have been fucking us for the last few years and now it s time for us to fuck them Supply and demand has caught up to the current market You think Nvidia will ever see sales like the ETH mining of the last few years It s a consumers market
Welcome to a bear market
It's just the end of a boom in a boom bust cycle
To be fair the entire stock market has been in a pretty rough spot recently Plus tech stocks are usually one of the worst performing stocks when the market is stressed This is because computers are usually considered more luxury items At least newer products are
Awaiting maturity and affordability of boards X3D chips to drop Then I might consider upgrading For now my 5900x still does 1440p just fine
macro economics ETH is now proof of stake which means miners do not need nearly as much GPUs
I remember when their stock was below 4 00
The stock market is basically a horoscope for rich white people and often times has little to no connection to reality
Welcome to the fact that stock value isn't tied to company value Or company value isn't tied to anything real Say hello to 2001
They missed their earnings goal but the market is just fucked in general Buy now you'll make money in a year or so
There's a slump in the market because of inflation and because work from home had everyone buy new computers so it'll be a year or two before people will start to buy new hardware again AMD is not hit as bad as some though they're fundamentally a solid company that is taking market share from the competition I have a feeling RDNA 3 will shift market share for them too especially given how badly people are receiving the new RTX 4000 cards
More sellers than buyers
because it can't easily run Stable Diffusion
2 reasons of many 1 Crypto demand no more 2 Pandemic demand no more There are many additional variables at play here that I wont get into If you re actually interested in knowing why and you invest any amount I strongly recommend you read listen to economic finance books by actual economists professors I m talking dozens of books at hundreds of hours of read listen time gl
Inflation
The economy in total is taking a dump so the vast majority of companies are suffering losses in investment value
Fundamentals matter less in a liquidity driven market
Have you not noticed GPU prices
Lisa su said yesterday that the PC market has weakened significantly plus US ban on exciting AI chips to China plus crypto going to shit and Ethereum going to proof of stake
tech is getting slammed on top of an announced production quota cut All the big businesses are planning for a recession in the next year or two
You should worry about your phone's charge more than the market imo
Your battery seems to be down 89 too
It s really simple Amd doesn t make its chips They are made in Taiwan by Taiwan semiconductors Lots of problems with Taiwan China Plus lots of supply problems
Pricing went up Cost of doing business went up invester confidence after seeing piss poor performance due to stock shortages made them sell stocks
Check the entire market especially tech stocks
The semiconductor companies got hit hard because of Biden s decision to restrict the import of chips to China It effected nvda AMD and Intel It s like these companies didn t have enough demand issues and the decision made them worse
This is a long game company with excellent products and constant innovation They also have a great public sentiment given their commitment to price to performance Hold and buy more on the dip Long term
It s preparing for the crescendo On 16th Oct CCP congress will grant Xi 3rd term Taiwan feared from beginning of this year that after his 3rd term is secured things will start to escalate TSM will be in existential trouble soon Putin is waiting with tactical nuke for China again as he did with Olympics to invade Ukraine China is the daddy here
Inflation sure is great isn't it s
General market down and AMD sales were below expectation Price high due to expectation when below expectation if fell harder
Because stock markets don't represent how well a company does it represents how good the perception of the company is in the eyes of the average investor Which usually lacks knowledge in technology fields That and the general state of the economy
Because we ARE NOT IN RESSETION do you understand Or do I need to send the FEDS to your door
The market is down PC demand is down interest rates are up investment in new tech will be hit competition is up None of these bode well for their stock price in the short term However if you're a believer in AMD you should be buying every share of it you can afford because it's on sale right now
market in general but price to performance Trying to sell products at intel pricing caused a big sway with the next gen ryzen gamers looking at team blue these days intel 12th 13th gen still ahead in benchmarks so maybe a part reason P Ryzen by all means was a great CPU release issue is price creep has occurred less silicon out there pandemic tax general market things will come back sometime A fairly poor 6000 series reception with underwhelming GPUS Luna crashing the market in general with crypto mining now not as big due to the merge all has its impact on pricing not pumping cards out to miners by the pallet usually means prices c come down GPU availability magically come back just before the merge Almost seems somewhat staged but who knows Recession is the big reason mainly but people aren't real keen on paying intel pricing for a new gen CPU from AMD the low end to mid tier market is where they should of stuck they slowly rise prices not a good value choice when team blue is a little more dollars in some cases that's where Ryzen had a good reception and in turn share prices went up let down by the GPU segment the price of Ryzen next Gen is expensive not good value when intel still has AMD by an edge in the next gen CPU game With all the issues I had with my 5800x usb port problems endless bios updates I made the jump back to team blue it was a solid CPU let down by suboptimal board support and problems early adopter tax to hardware these days means I don't bother doing builds as often but I feel AMD has lost some of its shine over time Ryzen brought them on the map and it will take them off it if they don't price their silicon to suit CPUs are certainly great their buggy driver gpus not so much not a great reception to cut down watered down pci express bus speeds and poor benchmarking with woeful driver issues early days AMD could really excel here and gain market share with more affordable competition towards the i3 end of the scale
Because people aren't willing to pay as much for the stock as a few months ago The stock price shows what people are willing to pay at that specific point in time Anything beyond this is just speculation The reason for that could be the market itself it could be the company's valuation it could
The whole market is down everything was super inflated and apparently stonks do not only go up
It's universal not just AMD People are staring at their wallets and thinking F this ill keep my food thankyou
Not selling my shares anytime soon Entire market is getting shit on
Interest rates are up which discounts future revenues harder This is combined with the mining revenue becoming zero miners putting up GPUs for sale Zen 4 platform costs being a bit high still Even when RDNA 3 launches there won't be a huge market to sell to only the 700 market will get an upgrade since the lower end has so much inventory So maybe flat or down this holiday season as well since used inventory makes selling current new products hard But revenue probably recovers next year with 8000 series laptops Zen4x3D lower priced RDNA 3 products The Fed is expected to hike interest rates further and cause a global recession but get inflation in order Within a few years the Fed will cut the interest rates to stimulate growth This information is partially priced in by the market so the drop in the stock price of AMD is reflecting this recession As the global recession happens and the Fed starts signalling that it will stop hiking rates and reverses course AMD stock will appreciate tl dr AMD to the moon 2024
There was a stimulus and crypto bubble that drove up
They were off 1billion dollars and will have an operating loss of 250 million That is the real reason and now investors are spooked This is the actual real reason Go check news sources and they will explain it in more detail as AMD retail sales are suffering but server side is doing good and gpus are slightly down but it was already projected to me lower this quarter
Intel
They missed on client sales Server sales up but not enough
m a c r o
I guess not a lot of people are shopping for the new 7000 cpu because of the bad cooling design
Stick to playing with your pc
Selling good competitive products and stock market valuation are 2 different not necesarly related things
We're in the dump part of pump and dump
Learn how stocks work
World economy there aint many people who want to purchase a 400 bucks mainboard just to be able to get an Ryzen 7000
Pump and dump If the stocks always stay at the same price how can the whales make money Remember Bill Gates quote You can only win crypto manipulate if you have more money than Elon Same apply to stocks
You don't follow the news a lot Zen 4 is selling poorly and not meeting expectations
Pe high Intel is returning Market sentiment low
What app or website do you guys recommend for buying stocks
NVIDIA is also down to about a third and Intel to about a half It's on one hand a stock market thing which doesn't always reflect sales but in this case AMD just announced that it would miss projections by 1B which means that stock market expectations are right This still doesn't mean that AMD is in a bad situation certainly not much worse than other companies but yes the market isn't what it was a year ago
These companies lie when they say crypto wasnt their bread and butter for the last 10 years
Build back better printing money and inflation from clown spending bills
Tech is a speculative asset Future growth is priced in so when future growth starts becoming fuzzy the stock starts falling in response Plus you gotta consider the absolutely insane bullrun we had since the covid crash The economy rn is also fukd and the fed is continually being hawkish introducing further rate hikes to try and stabilize inflation thats running out of control
No one is buying the new CPU s I blame motherboard prices But it really doesn t matter cause the bottom line is no revenue Intel won t have it any easier when they launch It s definitely a down time right now
PC sales rocketed during Covid and at that time Intel had really bad products As sales went up stock went up Post covid PC sales went back into usual slump Sales came down earnings estimates came down and at the same time markets are crashing
People broke af right now
This is not AMD this is the whole market
Because pretty much all of us have less money today than we did a year ago All general expenses are higher and PC hardware prices are also higher
Market is deep in the shitter Now is a good time to buy if you have excess capital
Time to stack up AMD never slow down in server space
If you looked at AMD stick even at 70 before it shot up to 150 it's P E ratio was 50 or even 100 1 The price already had a lot of overly optimistic growth and profitability assumed At 150 I don't think it was even rational The market will tend to find a rational price for things over a long period time but the price of something at any given point in time can be way off Additionally there was more retail sales for AMD going into covid then they're likely to be coming out of covid especially with fiscal tightening happening in most countries In short amd's price was way too high and now they're looking at a slowdown in sales due to a global economic slowdown and reality is descending upon amd's investors
Same with nvidia it used to be 300 a year ago now its 120
During corona everyone needed a home office You had to buy a motherboard to get a graphics cars as a combo AMD sold a lot Now many have more computers than they need and also many unused motherboards And the market is down
Poor quarter report bear market chart decreasing
1 3 of where it was a year ago 20x what it was 4 years ago and the economy is literally collapsing hmm why
products dont have much to do with stock price during recession and tightening
There is a market wide selloff and AMD is put directly into technology stocks bracket which will have the market wide swings amplified AMD stock going down here has literally nothing to do with AMD performance or actions Welcome to securities market
Buy low sell high
Because the stock market isn't based on the fundamentals people like to claim it's based on people's perceptions NOW those perceptions may be based on fundamentals but it doesn't have to be and many times isn't Cut to our current situation now we are in a bear market and a portion of why a bear market even comes about is because people believe it was either coming or we were in one Enough of that happens and surprise we get what everyone thought
It s on sale
Missing the revenue targets by 1B probably has something to do with that
Stock prices have very little to do with the quality of a product how well the company is managed etc When the entire stock market is having its worst year since 1970 it's because everyone is selling everything irrespective of quality Not to mention we're in a global economic recession so buying CPUs and GPUs is not the first thing on a lot of people's minds right now
Have you missed the stock market trend over the past several months
Because the entire market was severely over inflated due to band aid policies after COVID to prevent a crash
Welcome to investors don't know jackshit about values starring WS and the Banks But seriously investments are more about short term potential gains than they ever will be about long term value Once you realize this you'll understand how entirely stupid economics is as a field right now in the US
It s the whole market just not AMD It s all the markets from Wall Street to Japan and the crypto market But wait for the bull run Now is the time to start buying shit tons of stock Just remember to pick the right ones
Simple answer is they traded far over what should be a reasonable PE ratio They are still having supply issues and are trading over 28x earnings Until they are closer to half that they have more room to go down especially in the current market environment That said a lot of the market is at multiples that are too high Just how I see it though
Did you miss the memo that we are in the midst of a huge recession Lol
Good time to buy
The market is cyclical Every five years almost like clockwork all the semiconductor industries rise and fall Everyone just upgraded Won't see another surge for 3 5yrs when everyone feels like upgrading again AMD will settle somewhere around the 50 20
They just announced that they missed their target for this quarter by 1 billion that says it all
All tech stocks are down a lot right now
look around bro
The entire market is going down right now The fake recession the government created to scare us back to work is finally taking hold
The whole Market is down
First Because the PC market is in decline after the surge in purchases during the pandemic the second reason is that people invest more out of impulse and feeling than logic This is the Fear of an artificial recession created by high interest rates it is comical how economists manipulate the market to make billions
Their 1B revenue shortfall
The stock has been overvalued for years its price was built on expectations of future growth not current fundamentals Thus when the macro economic climate goes sour and growth prospects decrease the share price pops This is why i m not a growth investor I know I sound like an asshole but if you don t understand these things please don t buy individual stocks Keep your money in funds Most commenters here aren t serious investors
Read every comment in this thread No one knows jack shit
Supply chain Capacitors are still a big issue and effecting a lot of their mid market items Most capacitors that are used for mid tier processors are supplied by China which is having an issue meeting demand Higher end capacitors for higher end units are not under the same demand so the supply there has not changed much but that is not where the bulk of their consumer base is This is on top of the general issues with the market at this time
Everything has tanked Pick any company that is doing well and their stock will be in the gutter
Zen 4 is meh
The global economy is headed into one of the biggest downturns we ve ever seen nothing has held the peak from last year Probably gonna slide a little more until whatever is eating the markets gets resolved
After reading through all of these comments we see the majority of people can't see the forest for the trees Some people are getting fairly close with their analyst and all the small veritables do play a part But the larger reason why AMD Nvidia Intel micron etc are posting poor numbers comes down to an appalling lack of OEM business Sure we talk about this processor or that graphics card day in and day out Hell that's the only information that the media pushes at us But all these companies bread and butter comes from the orders placed by Lenovo HP Dell etc These OEMs aren't selling many desktops and fewer than projected laptops Once the manufacturers are able to gain more ground which won't be until after this recession these tech companies are going to be in weeds
The stock was never worth 150 bucks valuations where overblown across the whole sector
This server and international tech news have been explaining why non stop for the past week How in the world is this even a question Gotta be a troll
They have an abundance of stock due to the miners They ordered 4 million of 5nm chips and due to the glute from miners they are not making as much sales Nvida is in the same boat with their 4xxx series They expected their sales to be the same pre covid
Their revenue is down drastically since its ATH and it is expected to continue to fall Basically every tech stock was pretty overvalued and now with the market down Tech stocks are being hit really hard
Tell me you're oblivious to everything going on in the world around you without telling me you're oblivious
They are but theres two main things going on Intel 12 13 gen are very power houses to gaming and AMD is getting quite down in the market as It was before the 12th gen TLDR its not that AMD is doing bad its Intel thats not doing AS BAD as It was before leaving less market to AMD
a the whole market is down b Zen3 and Zen4 are being beaten in value by Alder and Raptor Lake supposedly c kinda like B but the 12600k is still the best gaming cpu you can buy rn d people severely overestimated how many GPUs they sold during the market crash NVIDIA outsold them by many times can t remember for sure but i was a lot e the ethereum merge happened flooding the used GPU market f total gpu demand is kinda low rn new g we ve had a crypto and covid spike for a while now actually
1 we are in a recession and the market is adjusting for that 2 Ryzen 7000 series is selling worse than anticipated numbers game out friday
The economy is in the gutter and everybody on this site claims it has nothing to do with the current leader in office as copium
well whole market has been down for most of the new goverment and new president I lost myself 82k worth of profits and now im about 23k in the hole but im not selling in this market im trying to add when I can Maybe after 2024 will be better after the election
Because it was massively overvalued
I shorted the hell out of amd How could you not see the current economic situation Also dumb fucks only buy first gen anything thinking they are future proofing I am happy my 5950x and 5800x3d Latest gen gave me no reason to upgrade Fuck amd for trying to be intel
Not meeting sales quota and stagnating market share are bad in the eyes of investors AN economic crisis is also at the horizon Not to forget that Crypto and PC gaming are also dead
Their new cpus aren't selling Too expensive buy In They are going to start losing the little market share they have by next quarter if they don't pull their heads out
They missed their earnings target by a billion dollars Edit Sorry revenue
Because 7600x is 300
Due to competition with Intel Zen 3 prices had to be cut significantly and thus margins are down Zen 4 is DOA due to AM5 DDR5 CPU pricing and 13th gen looks better from the preview GPU sales are also in the gutter as mining is dead and there are used cards for cheaper Ryzen 6000 launched early but showed up in laptops extremely late and still is uncommon DC is the only thing AMD has going for it right now The Xilinx acquisition will probably be good for long term but with how quickly most of AMDs core market went downhill it's not looking like such a great move now though luckily it was an all stock deal so it's not as bad as if they used cash stock There's also the recession the US government blocking some sales to China and more expensive TSMC nodes And if China goes to war with Taiwan it's going to be a shit show for companies that rely on TSMC but that's like half the sector
probably because all of their GPUs are worse than a 3070 I don't know
Basically the world is run by the stock market How fucking ridiculous right It's not even real money that funds the companies and it drives the global economies AMD doing well Doesn't matter stock market says otherwise
1 000 000
Everything is down from recession due to covid inflation and money print I belive All markets are in the red as GDP had been down 3 quarters in a row It'll all level out in time
CHIP SHORTAGE CRISIS
If they ever fix their black screen and HW acceleration issues then their GPUs might sell better
Have you been living under a rock
This is fucking hilarious We re in a recession brother everything is down
Lol recession
Amd could have dominated nvidia but they still just as greedy as nvidia Instead of pricing their GPUs aggressively They price it juuust below nvidia and given the lack of decent ray tracing or encoding support they are just alternatives if nvidia GPUs aren't there Hopefully Intel sets fire to their asses
I think the most important reason is that AMD's product is worse than its competitor
AMD has always been a conundrum to me they supply like 70 of the world's server chips best all around GPU's for a much better price than Nvidia yet Intel and Nvidia have always traded higher thinking face As a network engineer I would never use intel Nvidia unless it was a specific condition from client but that's never happened Since I've been doing this type of work 20 years when I give specs and prices for AMD CPU GPU vs Intel Nvidia 98 of my clients have Always been so I get 2 4x the cores threads per cpu on amd and can get 2 or 3 GPUs instead of 1 Nvidia ohh and to top it off the AMD setup will allow you to buy a redundant backup and or a second server for almost the same price as the Intel Nvidia We'll go with AMD Now before all you intel Nvidia fans blow up I do know there are advantages for certain fields of work research but it's mainly gaming I'd rather have an all around PC that does a little of everything well I submit this challenge to you guys go to Amazon Newegg wherever and build a intel Nvidia machine and a amd amd machine with a maximum 2k budget I know everything is hella expensive rn but up until 2 5 years ago crypto miners and chip shortage because I could basically double everything most core thread speed cpu x2 and atleast 2 gpu's for the same price as a 4 core processor and a mid range Nvidia gpu So it's always baffled me about amd's stock prices But this probably has a lot to do with it In accordance with their technology exchange agreement Intel and AMD amended their contract in 1984 to allow AMD to be a second source for the successive generations of the x86 processor architecture the successors to the 8086 the 80186 and 80286 in exchange for substantial royalties to Intel
Well on userbenchmark my Ryzen 5 5600X is the most popular Ryzen chip currently That CPU is behind like 5 or 6 intel chips lol That and their new Zen 4 7000 series has been widely panned as a price to performance nightmare In combo with my RTX 3070 I just installed last night I can play virtually any game out there at 1440p locked at 144FPS on Ultra settings I'm thrilled and wildy satisfied with my machine But as to the drop in stock prices probably 2 biggest reasons TBH I would've gone with an Intel CPU if I didn't already have a very expensive older model X 370 AM4 motherboard But zero complaints here Edit also everyone is down across the board No more pandemic less people stuck at home with time to build a PC haha
Your investing incorrectly
Their products are not good are excellent Current valuation makes no sense but market is crazy and there is war
The gold rush is over baby In all seriousness no one will be buying the absurd amounts of products they were during the pandemic the stock prices were inflated they are coming down to more real prices
I've read that profits on all CPU makers have fallen post big COVID upgrade cycle
Nows the time to buy
Because I purchased at 147 50
A entering a recession B a year ago AMD and Nvidia were massively inflated due to miner overbuying
The recession
Covid made it peak now we are in a recession
This seems to be part of an industry wide phenomenon currently happening These giant tech companies ordered way too much stock and since the bitcoin gpu crash demand has gone down and now they're stuck with all this stock of new products
Crypto crashing and semiconductor shortages will do that to a company like AMD
Also people didn't hop into AM4 as expected Too pricey for many in already streched up pockets
PE compression Market isn t paying as much for profits as it used to Conversely this is also a good time to buy
Besides the market in general being down consider this For the first time in 8 years AMD is firing a TRUE platform change for people that want the newest AMD CPU AM4 with DDR4 memory was upgrade friendly can use the same RAM motherboard and CPU cooler for a LONG time as far as PC tech goes For the first time in recent memory if you want the newest AMD CPU you also need to buy the newest motherboard and RAM Both of which are the most expensive versions EVER So for the first time in 8 or so years if you want the newest CPU it won t cost you just the CPU 300 450 550 or 750 dollars but also the cost of the motherboard and RAM 300 150 at least So when the 5000 series came out it was just a BIOS update and the CPU ITS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE COST IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A COMPUTER that s less than 8 years old Time will tell if this early adopters cost will be as beneficial as AM4 was in 2014
I think when they had comparable cards to 30 series for a lot cheaper than rtx cards during Covid they took a lot of nvidias customer base and now that the market has crashed and rtx cards have came down not everyone is buying amd anymore That and like everyone on this forum said Covid inflated the shit out of everything and now it s all coming down
Because they are not perfect like the guerilla marketing would have you believe Youtube fanboy channels only boot lick
Because you re likely to get a better return holding cash right now
It s the fact that the whole IT industry is unable to make any money since profits are so down as a whole
This guy has been hiding in the dark
i still remember in 2014 amd's stock was like 2usd lol
There is more to it People where waiting for AM5 to release new GPU s being announced Slowing PC sales and the fact that it s expensive to upgrade to a brand new platform with minimal gains and high temps I think it will be one more though quarter and then hopefully they have some crazy good GPU announcement to compete with NVIDIA and sales will pick back up
Everything is going down
Futanari Inflation
It's back to the range when I was playing with iron condors on this stock right after covid Any lower seems crazy but this drop is reasonable rn
Tell me you know nothing about the current economy without telling me you know nothing
The whole market is down and AMD follows the market closely
Maybe Zen 4 isn't selling as well as they thought it would
Great products lower sales I would assume
I dont think its just them bro look at Bitcoin
We are in a recession
Bro global pandemic Hello L
Overpriced products with highpower draw and temperatures Very little gains in gaming performance when you compare them to am4 overclocked cpu
Interest rates
Charge your phone
This data alone is interesting given the crypto bubble bursting
Have you even looked at any other stocks
Guess you don t invest in the stock market huh
Fire sale buy now
The stock market is just speculation gambling
No one mining anymore graphics card demand fell off of a cliff
Recession
U buying Cpu Gpu's while inflation is high and people barely got money to live comfortably
Demand destruction on the consumer side
Tech socks to me seem to either be popping and propping the market up or being way under I'm assuming now is because everyone is afraid of another tech bubble
Everything got artificially raised by the artificial boom of demand caused by the pandemic crypto mining Now that the pandemic is mostly over and crypto mining is dead the demand is back to pre 2020 level
Oh they're just having a sale on stocks right now
Buying opp
crypto crashed whole market is down but tech especially is coming down from its pandemic bubble
Tech market is way down look at Nvidia and Intel as well Similar data
Because we're in a recession bro Everything is down
It's not me it's you stock market
Crypto crash
October is historical ending of recessions Hope the winter will twart the war a while
Look at the macro environment we re in right now Everything is down big AMD is no exception to a correction after such a huge run up the past couple years Had half to a full decade of growth in a matter of less than 24 months
HOLD
Covid 19 subsiding allowing the world to somewhat return to normal is the real answer With everyone stuck in their homes for nearly two years the entire PC market saw a massive influx of new customers Now those new customers are getting back to their old lives and as a result many companies are seeing less business demand which translate to lower stocks prices
Global recession
We are in a recession
Because the stock market is only tangentially related to the value potential and output of the companies listed on it
Dude everything is down
Cause of fall in chip demand
Because ir was overvaluer like the entire market
Missing target by a billion doesn t help much
Inflation is a bitch people don't have money current international events are making others wary and tensions within our own countries are building
We re all poor now
I see you mayo boy
They went from team green to team red you can say ha ha
Depending on their new gpu launch it might get a good bump
You ve been living under a rock or live inside a mountain to no know the whole market is down
Time to buy
Because stocks are completely detached from the actual company This is true for basically all big companies
Am5 is a mediocre lunch and didn t capture the budget and the return of the king like the original announcement of am4 did Also Lott said to invest in stock so possible market manipulation Idiegress
Everyone who wanted a PC because of the lockdown now have a fairly new PC Expect a drop in CPU demand
The lockdowns increased demand for all computing products Now people can go out again they are So demand for everything computer has falling through floor Amd stock reflects this
Have you seen cpu sales drop
The last drop was due to them announcing their new revenue projections for q3 2022 if I'm not wrong Everything else before was just the entire semiconductor market and market in general tanking
Depressingly I think this shows what their strategy for rx7000 will be They will go 100 lower on price that equivalent nvidia with so many less features They are not going to go for market and mind share
Perspective Change to the 10 year curve and tap your head saying I should have bought at 3
Crime is usually it in the stock market
You are obviously not home in investing but that's fine The whole market tanked and a lot of companies were actually overvalued This is just a correction or in worst case the beginning of a recession One way on another the stock price doesn't always reflect the companies well doing
Because their new AM5 CPUs are constantly hitting that 95C and the stocks are cooling to cope with it
People keep saying world inflation is at a all time high well yah it is but what the Media dosent tell you is that people panic sold many investments When money held up and transitioned to a solid not moving from said stock investment crypto or whatever the value of said investment rises due to trade volume and amount of units not in circulation So you got a panic like the Ukraine war Chinese crypto crack downs etc people panic they liquid said assets now that solid money is a liquid flowing freely Give it a year or two things will stabilize and go back up Personally it s a good time to invest right now however that s presuming you aren t gonna panic check or second guess the investment still a good idea to have a legal stock person handle it for you if you are unsure
Everything plummeted great time to buy
It was priced for big growth and recession makes that less likely I think it s overcorrected but I also think it ll go lower
Beside the market bekng in a oberall dow trend being the likely after that dies down so does the stock
Why are US Bonds down I thought the US of A is doing
Whole market is down AMD released a Q3 report which was below estimates
They literally just lowered guidance
Because the stock market reflects a gamblers bet on the economy not the economy itself
It s the whole market
it's overvalued imo check their stock price before the lock down 3 2022 it's no where near where it is now it has more to drop x200B most stocks are returning to their pre lock down prices
Global financial crisis
Cause economics and stuff
Time to buy
Lol is this humorous Because I find this humorous
a major selloff of stocks it's basically that easy if you look at the s p 500 you can see how the index has declined since peak however this is actually a perfect place to start buying dollar cost average some each month
When the Dust starts flying in the midwest then we call it G
Stimmys
I was an investor that sold at 150 the reason it was up there was because about a year ago was when they made a deal with Facebook when they became meta I don't remember the exact deal but I remember waking up to it surging and I sold it quickly cuz I knew it wasn't actually worth that much
Is it because GPU prices are falling
Because the cost of capital is expensive and we re no longer living in a world where money is essentially free Growth equities are some of the longest duration assets and rely heavily upon the cost of future cash flows
Watch the news Also their products are on par with competitors now not killing them anymore
Lol if the value of the company increases my opinion due to good company decisions but the stock gets cheaper then it might be a good idea to look into getting some AMD stock once the market corrects
They market overall bad news Thursday night
Perhaps you don't understand the stock market
No more crypto boom isn't exactly synonymous to doing well
You should charge your phone
crypto
looks at a single stock and ignores the entire market
If the shares were still at 140 then AMD would be worth twice as much as Intel People here won't like to hear it but AMD was and still is compared to Intel overvalued
Best time to buy more now It s under value
Sorry gang it's because I bought some of their stock
You re e especially the type of person that desperately needs to invest in the market and not pick individual stocks
a The whole market is down right now b Zen4 is a poor value proposition at the low and mid end and most of the revenue is there This will be fixed when the B650 motherboards come out and DDR5 prices drop End result is Zen4 is selling very poorly still less than Zen3 c Nvidia announced the 40 series but no news on RDNA3 yet
Would also like to add that good products does not equal a higher stock price The financial results is what leads to higher stock price Doesn't matter if you make the best product in world if you sell it at a loss
They are down like 3 billion on sales projections for one thing another is the wider economy and finally AM5 is underwhelming in sales
The entire market is down 20 and technology stocks are generally a lot more volatile than stocks in other industries
Lisa Bae just giving you an opportunity to buy in bro I joined WallStreetBets before AMD hit 10 which really wasn t that long ago They may be down currently but they ve spent the past half decade or so just absolutely exploding in growth The price action needs stability 800 in 5 years isn t too sustainable
Years of fed QE inflated equity prices
Because all companies were overvalued the past decade all market manipulation and they are still not near their real value drop more
Are you sure it's not your phone's battery diagram s
Most stocke are down at least that far And fundamentals dont mean much anymore
Crypto mining with GPUs is basically over AMD and NVIDIA will never be the same
The death of GPU mining
1 Market index goes down most stocks down together Only a matter of going down more or down less 2 Good company doesnt mean good for investment since the stock price could already be overvalued
The crypto crash hurt the entire tech sector as especially gpu makers who had gotten used to selling every available piece of silicone they had at higher than msrp
This is the answer everything is down 40 compared to a year ago that's part of the recession that's about to hit as well as the decline of the euro and pound sterling
This AND there was an unusual spike in pc and pc component demand at the beginning of the pandemic that isn t there anymore
Seems to me like the market is going back to pre covid levels During covid many stocks exploded and reached heights that seemed unlikely before covid Now they all go back down
On top of that buying after good news or companies you like are how you lose money Those are emotional decisions based on past results Tech stock is very risky compared to let's say Coca Cola Coca Cola can use the same factories for decades Tech has to improve their product or die Especially hardware can be quick
Lockdowns
Yeah Intel and Nvidia are in the same boat
Few Understand
And AMD announced there was a 53 drop in client sales a few days ago
Yeah and a year ago was still really pent up demand and everything plus markets aren't all about how well things are doing or selling either
Plus TSMC is jacking fab prices significantly This will hurt AMD's bottom line a lot more than it's competitors Things aren't exactly rosy for Nvidia or Intel either though Intel is still losing marketshare and Nvidia still have a supply glut from prev gen products
Market corrections will do this can confirm
Rather than saying whole market is down you could also say the whole market was up after COVID due to unrestricted cash injection
Even non US currencies are tanking
Everything is down except living expenses disappointed face
AMD also issued stock to buy Xilinx there was a lot of Xilinx holders who were just playing the arbitrage game And started selling as soon as the purchase went trough and they got AMD stock
Still weird that nvidia is down less than AMD and Intel despite having the worst P E ratio of the lot Especially with Intel paying a decent dividend
Good reason for Nvidia though everyone knew Ethereum was going to turn off mining leaving very little point to mine with expensive GPUs anymore Imagine getting revenue only off gamers p
not Apple
So is this the dip
I looked up actually surprised to see how much higher Nvidia's stock is over Intel's Even AMD is much higher
is that piece of or proof of stake
Meanwhile nvidia charging 900 for a 4070
Also the oil prices and the Russia Ukraine conflict
I'm buying AMD stocks again as soon as the market isn't a complete shitshow
Took me a while to realise you meant the S P
if you re making stock choices on AMD based mostly or exclusively on their desktop component market performance I strongly strongly urge you to look at just how hard and how aggressively EPYC and it s related archi s has eaten into the big data enterprise server sphere It s a force that will thoroughly unseat Intel there just how they did on desktop when Zen2 X570 hit but at SCALE
I think it is a whole bunch of problems If the Intel Arc drivers had been better there would have been another major issue It is obvious prices must drop further I bet Nvidia Intel and AMD will try to keep high until the Chinese new year I plan to build a new tower in February or March It is my opinion that is the timeframe needed to drop pricing This is a brutal market for AMD
I suspect AMD will continue to get a bigger slice of the data center pie from Intel and that's a pretty big market In The last 5 years though ARM has started to make inroads in the data center space as well If they price their next gpus competitively I think they'll take share from Nvidia as well It was good for them to get the Xbox and PlayStation market but I think those have fairly low margins Moore's law is virtually dead and it's going to be a problem for the entire industry to find ways of marketing only marginally faster processing on one to two year cycles AMD seems to have a strong position compared to Intel unless Intel really turns it around which so far isn't looking too likely although AMD relies on TMSC which is in Taiwan and Intel owns their own fabs mostly so geopolitical instability may be a big risk for team red versus team blue It also means AMD has a little less control over their cost structure but they also don't have to undergo the formidable cost of building new fabs at the next node I've been starting to eyeball AMD stock but haven't pulled the trigger yet and want to have a better understanding of their anticipated future earnings and profitability which recently was revised down due to reasonable fears of a global recession
Because the stay at home time is over people are back at work Laughs in permanent home office
tech stocks have been long over due for a correction
True enough
Yep Now is the time to buy to catch the next upswing
Yes Fire sale
AMD is sitting on more cash than they know what to do with the stock price has everything to do with the interest rate you can get with treasuries which are assumed to be close to zero risk
I bought at 18 and haven t looked at it in 2 years I m still gonna hold onto the shares but I was just curious
That has changed since last night The stocks haven t
I bought at 18 and haven t even looked at it in 2 years I don t plan on selling until 2050 or so so I don t care what it does I was just curious
Are you say naval blockade
Or Taipei stock exchange
Do you know what a recession is It s when your countries economy shrinks two quarters in a row like ours the last two quarters
I bought at 18 and haven t even looked at it in 2 years I don t plan on selling until 2050 or so so I don t care what it does I was just curious
They're practically paying you to buy theirs
I use E Trade
They drove cryptos to drive sales
Great point well made
To everyone reading this don't take financial advise from random redditors lol
And by the right ones you mean the S P
Let the tendies return
They no longer have supply issues you're months behind They have been asking TSMC to lower their future orders because they are projected to slow down
Omg hope your wrong
That says pretty little actually
The normal interest rates are needed to avoid an even more massive inflation
Every stock is valued cautiously with expectations of future growth Some less some more
Would you care to clarify with your knowledge then rather than just randomly commenting on various comments about how people don't know what they're talking about
It's reddit so within expectation
People are soooo
Srsly
Not true They are ramping down production in anticipation for lower growth already
Shell
Why is that It just released about 1 week ago
Intel has more money to lose in war of attrition
AMD wants pc gaming to die anyway so they have less competition Xbox pc game pass is a joke
PC GAMING DEAD What
I just belly laughed gif giphy XgM66sY5pSD4aiPU6F downsized
My 6800XT disagrees
I bought at 18 and haven t looked at it in 2 years I m still gonna hold onto the shares but I was just curious
userbenchmark Seriously
3000 series can't play bf2042 Those games run better on AMD cards and frostbite engine runs better on alderlake cpus
You have the opposite set up to succeed in battlefield titles
I m not taking investment advice from someone who can t use the correct you re Sorry
Wait until the next Fed meeting after they raise interest rates You'll see another big dip then Also lunar cycles bro
I mean I purchased at 18 a few years ago I was happy to let it sit all the way thru to a 10x increase but never sold I want to own it for the next 20 years and see where they re at I don t care about a temporary dip but I was curious
Buy even more now
They already upgraded to AM3 or Alderlake
Too early to tell B650 boards aren't out yet and many are waiting to see what X3D brings to the table
I ve been mining Bitcoin since it was 2 No zeros on the end of that just 2 The fact that it s still here is a testament to its power regardless of the price
I knew someone would comment that
I have mutual funds but I don t check them I bought AMD at 18 and haven t looked at it in 2 years I m still gonna hold onto the shares but I was just curious
I bought at 18 and haven t even looked at it in 2 years I don t plan on selling until 2050 or so so I don t care what it does I was just curious

About to hit We had three straight quarters of negative gdp We have been in a recession for a while
we have been already in a recession We already passed 2 quarters of negative growth
Homie we been in a recession The only people who don t think so are the people who need your vote
It's also because zen 4 is the worst performing ryzen launch maybe aside from zen 1 Investors are dissapointed
Consumer demand was artificially increased by the amount of money pumped into the US Economy The fact that remote working exploded was a dream come true for the hardware side of the tech industry The cheap money is over with high interest rates and crazy inflation These companies are all suffering check out Nvidia s stock too lol
Combined with the chip shortage as well
AND Intel is in a way better position now with their cpus It used to be laughed at at some point While AMD has done well it's worth more if the competition is out of the game
Yeah I used to get downvoted for saying this Choosing companies to invest in is a bad idea for more than 99 of people unless you are willing to admit to yourself you are gambling with odds at best similar to black jack compared with the market average that is most people will make less money than just throwing their cash into a diverse all world ETF Sure some make a profit but it is balanced out by more people making a loss The more emotional you are the more you will lose also At very very least to get close to breaking even with every single transaction you need to take advantage of undue pessimism by buying and take advantage of undue optimism by selling
And executives wages are going up due to record profits for all corporations
If the corpos can't get their money in stock value they'll tear it directly from you instead LINE MUST GO UP
Thank your politicians for that
our beautiful xilinx my professor from 3 4 years ago fook I'm old
If you look at trading volume since the deal closed in mid February there hasn't been a noticeable change compared to normal volume before the deal Also when a company acquires another company for an all stock deal it isn't the same as a company issuing stock It is a conversion from one stock to another at a set rate In this case 1 7234 AMD shares per Xilinx share If AMD were to issue 35 billion in new shares it would dilute the original shares to a lower price as the company would have the same valuation split over more shares With a merger or acquisition the company's valuation is increased by an amount close to the valuation of the acquired company and won't dilute share prices the same way that a new issuing of shares would
You do realize Nvidia's main source of revenue is data center products like the A100 right
it's the dip after the dip but also before the real dip
Yes
Piece of steak
Proof of Shit Piece of Steak yummy
ETH has always been a piece of shit regardless
Proof of stake
ETH nauseated face
Yeah but that s just manufactured by fossil fuel producers Strange that stocks like XOM have remained relatively stable it s almost like they re pulling record profits and creating a massively inflated oil market Funny how the US always complains about oil and OPEC meanwhile it s the US own companies that are robbing the populace Just another reason to nationalize the fossil fuel industry
Yeah I was confused thinking the Scottish political party had stocks
IT AIN'T ANYMORE S P ITS NOW S ME
Fair point honestly i havent looked into it other than the previous ones who already bought in also not sure what that side of the business has been like since the beginning of the year
Yea tbh if they can get driver sorted like how AMD did my its just a bit of a waiting game for frankly everything from prices to new hardware to stocks
Nvidia already priced the 4cxx series high Also the latest card is massive AMD with RDNA did well hell I jumped back to team red after 10 years of just Nvidia cards for the 6700XT because it had 12GB of VRAM and was significantly cheaper The 7000 are a hard sell excellent reviews but for anyone with an AM4 board the Zen 3 chips offer a decent upgrade to let AMD sort the bugs in the new chipset
If you bought it that low you missed a pretty good opportunity to sell and make a lot of money depending on your initial investment and still retain your initial investment
He s not wrong though if you have the money it s the right time to invest obviously don t just throw your money at into the wind and expect a return do your research before you do anything and go in knowing all investments are a risk and you re not guaranteed a return no matter how stable the investment might seem going in Edit to be clear I can t stress enough that this should only be done if you truly have disposable income don t invest your life savings away hoping to be a millionaire
I'm averaging down on it but still buying I believe that it will recover in a few years and want to be ready for it Don't sleep on Intel either When their fabs come online Nvidia and AMD may end up actually being Intel's customers due to the CHIPS legislation Both of them are very vulnerable to sanctions against foreign fabs and they may have no choice but to line Intel's pockets with cash for home soil allocation Either way Intel will likely be printing money in a few years time
He is full of shit
This is backward thinking based on the past and on inflation caused by high consumption but the current inflation is not entirely created by high demand but by logistical problems caused by China and war in addition to expensive fuels whose price is manipulated by the oil cartel So high interest rates will not contain inflation it will only create unemployment and other problems It surprises me that people don't notice something so obvious
No not all stocks are valued cautiously That cuts against the core of both Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffets' investment strategy aka value investing The market completely runs away with itself and it does so fairly often If it didn't we would never have bubbles Sometimes wild expectations of growth pay off and a stock doesn't pop often exuberance leads to lost money But to say that everything is valued cautiously just isn't true This is a helpful read
Hugely more over tens of times yea
AMD wants pc gaming to die anyway In the long term you're right Eventually they want their APU's to replace everything Kind of Apple with their SoC's
So many redditors have no idea what they are talking about
i meant to say 3080 many apologies
What the fuck are they on about A recession is 2 consecutive quarters of significant drop in GDP We re in a recession
This reads like the owner of UB is pretending to be an AMD user
Well that explains your losses You can use spell check but think they make good products is solid due diligence Investing is more complicated then you think And good grammar won t stop you from losing a lot of money
Damn you have great self control
Trust me you can be in recession for a while A big crisis could be coming but most places aren't there yet
I guess the real question is what's the definition of recession that matters While the administration is lying and not being honest pulling back from all time highs with unlimited money supply shouldn't really be considered a recession in some ways It's like blaming Michael Jordan for scoring too many points the previous year so saying he's in decline the next year However we are about to enter a stagflation with high unemployment high interest rates high debt and increasing supply shocks to oil and food So yeah we're already in a recession but we're haven't even remotely hit bottom yet
They changed the definition of recession so now it is when companies start mass layoffs it is the start of a recession They may change the definition of it again so who knows
We re still dealing with the inflation the recession will hit probably next year when they stop raising rates
Wait for it Ain t seen nothing yet bud
We aren t done yet with dropping
Recession has barely started bub
Two quarters
We also have 3 5 unemployment Recessions are not just decided based on gdp
We ve had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP 3Q just ended and numbers aren t out yet Additionally the metric you re using is only a technical definition There are other metrics to consider like unemployment and right now there s plenty of evidence that says we are not yet in a recession
Yea we ve had a technical recession for some time now however it s not like other recessions in my lifetime with massive layoffs yet
With unemployment at 3 7 we re in a full employment recession which is the opposite of the jobless recovery of the early 2010s
This is up for debate though if thats the right metric The job market is super strong
Yeah but people are just starting to feel the heat Now we sweat in some time we get burns
yep so true but with like everything they say that no longer is a recession lol they re do the definition of things
That s only part of what shapes demand Needing hobbies that people could partake in from home was a huge boon stimulus checks or not
Their stock is suffering but the companies arent Most companies are reporting absolutely ridiculously out of line profits compared to normal years Its a large part of whats driving inflation right now Corporate greed on pricing because there's essentially no way for the government to stop them without an act of congress Which like good luck telling every republican and a good chunk of democrats in congress to actually try to pull back corporate greed
Mining dude
It s actually much simpler than that you could buy a gpu at msrp and use it to mine eth and make your money back within a few months Gamer demand was very small compared to miner demand because it was so profitable Same thing happened to Nvidia a few years back
The chip shortage didn t help their stock though It helped drive up price but not volume And manufacturers continued to sell at MSRP It was distribution retail that got the extra revenue The chip shortage hurt their stocks more than helped
Not sure what you re saying Intel has always been in a good position They hold the most market share and haven t really faltered They were def behind when Zen 3 came out but that was a point in time
Damn all corporations' profits are going up and shareholders are selling their stock
Who is having record profits past quarter
Every time I see this line it physically ruins my good mood How absolutely fucking disgusting that record corporate profits and record inflation are mentioned in the same sentence
Mostly because everyone's spending money on consumer goods not services
There are no record profits tho Intel lost money Nvidia lost revenue and AMD lost revenue
That's actually a lie with stock based compensation
Name a company please
Executive bonuses are probably not as great as you'd think given they usually get stock Losing have the valuation of a company doesn't generally do very well for public company leadership no matter the external factors
Xilinx is great for the long term
If you look at trading volume since the deal closed in mid February there hasn't been a noticeable change compared to normal volume before the deal Volume is meaningless what matters is the direction and depth on the ask bid sides It is a conversion from one stock to another at a set rate In this case 1 7234 AMD shares per Xilinx share Yes and Xilinx was trading slightly below the value of those stocks you would recieve Hence the arbitrage trade it isn't the same as a company issuing stock Yes it very much is Stocks that did not exist before AMD purchased Xilinx now exists to be traded The effect is exactly the same as if AMD had raised capital trough stock issuance first to pay for it in cash
Oh my god someone doesn't know something better be a dick about it
I was thinking they were referring to medicare Special Needs Plans and it was because everyone was investing in health insurance companies instead of AMD
Going hard in the paint and only gathering steam The only hardware that can compete with them are the companies rolling their own from scratch like GCP s Tensor Processing Units which they rent cycles on as opposed to selling out of hand so it s a non compete
It is a waiting game It has become like the old days when you buy a computer you can buy something 2x as fast in 2 years At least with 3nm 2nm and 1 4nm we seem to be on that path again
He is wrong we are most likely not at the bottom yet The housing market is just now crashing and we already had a rally in the market last week We are probably going down If you invest now you're not gonna get a return for a solid few years most likely But again don't take financial advice from random redditors myself included
Yuuuuuup
What you're saying all makes sense but at the same time I doubt the US will be sanctioning Taiwan anytime soon
I'm doing the same either it comes back up or we enter into a post apocalyptic scenario in which case it doesn't matter anyway
Because I think there is actual inflation that has only been triggered by recent events Inflation almost never runs amok in a vacuum normal times While current US interest rates are quite high 3 7 is much more normal than 0 2
Then we're easily looking at 10 yrs PC gaming is so high end growth is not sustainable all this r d and the majority of gamers and developer focus on console for the triple A releases I see MSI shifting focus to productivity laptops well since when
Mmhmm ok
The Saudis cutting production to spike price of petroleum is gonna hit pretty hard across all sectors this winter
It is indeed coming
Dust bowl Naw dawg time for the money bowl
They Wonder whose best interest that was
No we are technically currently in a recession right now
17 inflation in my country Western European country Our industries are being massacred by the high energy costs Some have already gone out of business Governments printing money to artificially try and keep energy prices low which won't work but will definitely drive up inflation further I sure do love economic warfare economic suicide
And Bub
Nope 1st 2nd and 3rd all negative
Uh huh
GDP is a pretty good metric when paired with other
Goes do
You can't change the meaning of things simply because it's politically convenient No one buys it Everyone knows it's a lie Some just choose to spread the lie further
My intention wasn t to list all the reasons rather the most important ones
Wait until next quarter Won't be as glamorous
LMAO x200B The driving factor of inflation has literally been our ability to print money like it's worthless
Anyone selling stock right now needs liquidity very badly It s a terrible time to sell
Automatic response I would say
So wouldn't the actual cost of the acquisition be the difference between what the AMD and Xilinx stocks were trading for at the time of the acquisition Not like a severe dilution of stock value like what eould occur if they AMD had issued more stocks to pay for Xilinx in cash Or am I misunderstanding
Strong suspicion the xilinx acq is to start trying to offer these sort of bespoke silicon for other ent customers who want to scale on fpga style approaches or to get their hardware ray trace on GPUs into a place to properly compete with RTX for those workloads ML etc
I m a noob so forgive me but does that mean going down a nm is exponential Because the performance gains this gen for Nvidias 4090 are honestly impressive regardless of price tbh
Can you show me a platform that doubled in performance in two years
My understanding was somewhere between 2 and 5 nanometer that quantum effects become too hard to control and we just can't make chips that small I didn't even know 1 4 nanometer was on the roadmap It's also my understanding that building and tooling the fabs that have these smaller processes becomes exponentially more difficult and expensive I'm a bit skeptical of the claim that things will continue to shrink and continue to hold their previous pace Intel has really struggled when they have gone down to smaller nodes I've heard also that there's a little bit of gimmickry in the naming of the size of the nodes now
He is wrong we are most likely not at the bottom yet And now what you are describing is trying to time the
if you expect a return sooner than a solid few years you're more gambling than investing anyway
Probably should ve been more explicit and stated that I don t mean invest right this second thought the money in the wind was a good enough analogy for blindly investing
In both the bedroom and investing trying to call bottom is a bad idea unless you wanna get pounded
If you invest now you're not gonna get a return for a solid few years most likely This doesn't say that what they said is bad or wrong though This just means that it may not be as lucrative and that it may be longer term but ultimately when things are low it is a good time to buy and they are quite low right now This is just a pointless semantics argument here You don't know when or if it will drop or how much but what we do know is that it's a sharp decline which is a good time to buy in outside of collapsing markets if you want to bet on a rebound Long term plays are on the line of several years minimum unless you're a constant market player that likes to skim In which case advice from randoms is meaningless and you've got your strategy
OPEC didn't cut production they cut quotas Even with the new lower quota they're still well under it
Is going to hit hard Period The whole world is getting into crisis it will be like the hunger games
Why doesn't the US just release our oil Aren't we currently producing the most barrels day We don't have the reserves of the Middle East but we have a good amount Or am I way off base here
That would actually decrease inflation not so bad thing to do
Heating is up 24 this winter NJ here
No it s actually not
I live in a country with constant recession I know you believe things are bad but you have barely started
No guy spoke facts
I should have mentioned im in Canada so im not sure what its like in the US right now but we re following into it very soon
The markets are but a lot of other factors which are often considered when declaring a recession aren't there yet Not everything revolves around the Dow NASDAQ S P
There is no released information on the third quarter
Look up what the NBER BCDC is
and that people arent buying it can have multiple reason I mean I got cash to burn but I aint buying it because my 5800X is more than sufficient Anotehr one just might not like the reason they run hot and another just might need to think about their money For a lot of peopel salaries have gone up big time in 2022 they can choose where they want to work because of the high demand etc Is that truly a recession
This is Reddit though if you don t list every single detail about something someone is going to chime in what you missed regardless of its lack of importance to the overall message of your post
Seriously I'm not even considering selling any time soon and a couple of my stonks are down well more than 50 from which they may never recover So dollar cost averaging it is to try and make up some of that difference No sell Only buy
I sold my positions 2 months ago I'm sitting on pure cash at this point I was planning to buy again last week but seeing those 't look like it's stopping I can buy 2 TSLA stocks with the 1 I just sold 2 months ago It's that bad Funnily enough the reason I cashed out is because I wanted to sell my US positions so I can convert the CAD to buy USD so I don't get to pay the borrow interest then forgot about it
Even if they aren t it s a hell of a lot better than the average worker seeing no increase at all
So wouldn't the actual cost of the acquisition be the difference between what the AMD and Xilinx stocks were trading for at the time of the acquisition No the cost will be whatever AMD is traded at times the number of shares they have to create out of thin air It dillutes the percentage that each share represents Not like a severe dilution of stock value like what eould occur if they AMD had issued more stocks to pay for Xilinx in cash Or am I misunderstanding It's the same thing With the difference that issuing more stock to raise capital Adds the sell pressure before you buy something Not all who has their Xilinx shared traded for AMD will later sell either But some would also buy AMD stock because they purchased Xilinx etc if they didn't trade for stock But the end result is the same Shares equal to the purchase price were created Let's make a easy example Scenario A Company A has 1000 total shares Company A sells 100 shares to raise capital to buy company B There are now 1100 total shares If stock price remains flat the market cap increased by 10 Each share now represents a smaller part of ownership in company A Scenario B Company A has 1000 total shares they want to buy company B They will trade Combany B stock for company A stock at a 1 2 ratio There are 50 shares of company B company A issues 100 new shares to buy company B There are now 1100 shares in total of company A The same things applies to market cap and ownership percentage You are just changing when selling pressure occurs it will still occur At the end of the day it is all the same You need to find people willing to own 1100 shares of company A to keep it at a certain price Before you only needed to find people willing to hold 1000 shares
Not quite But smaller scales eventually reduce power allowing higher clock rates The real benefit is thermal allowing larger dies It is exciting that we're back on major process improvements
I'm talking way back 386 to 486 to Pentium
They had a breakthrough and the 5 year Samsung roadmap goes to 1 4nm New gate designs are required for thermal and quantum effects GAA is good to 7 angstroms per lab testing So we have a path forward We stalled for what 8 years Research was performed and now we'll have a short term surge Then progress will slow IMEC and ASML have announced sub nm tools due in 2026 I personally would be shocked if those tools came on time but they are in development See their roadmap to 2036 By all means be skeptical I watch the money With Intel once again trying to become to most advanced chip maker that means more money for development
I'm literally saying not to invest Why would you invest at the beginning of a recession If you are investing truly and not trading than it will barely matter where you buy it at since you're just gonna hold it for five to 10 years anyway
Day trading and swing trading are common enough among investors and can very easily be full income jobs it's not gambling if you know what you're doing especially if you trade options
I wasnt saying a long wait was bad nor did I say it wouldn't be lucrative however we were in a bubble and it just burst it will likely be a while before you see profit when going long a lot of stocks are dropping to numbers they haven't hit in over a decade if you buy in now you probably have to hold for a long time Again I'm not saying that's necessarily bad if you want to buy and hold a bunch of stocks go ahead I never said not to
The consensus is still that the price of oil will be rising and it ll hit the stock market negatively
Actually they did in a way cut production On Monday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC shocked the oil market when it announced plans to reduce October oil production OPEC which includes OPEC and allied oil producing nations like Russia agreed to shave some 100 000 barrels per day bpd off next month s production targets Monday s announcement is unusual because it marks the first intentional output decline since the middle of the pandemic The move also effectively rolls back the production increase OPEC agreed to last month by the same number of barrels
Yeah but everyone is ignoring that because bear market In bear market neutral news bad news
They announced production cuts a few days ago
They're still going to cut production They're going to be below a new lower quota This is Saudi and Russian fascists playing US politics
They cut their production quotas
lol
Gonna be anarchy
We have been And we're doing more We cant keep doing this though OPEC keeps fucking us
You guy speak English
Ouch Canada has an awful economy
Out of curiosity are corporations a large part of your inflation over there too Its like legitimate fake inflation in the US right now cause of that shit
Boi oh boi us is effed
Or the logic
Cool but the quantitive gains of each generational improvement dwarf previous double values by quite a large margin
Thanks for the good info it's been a couple years since I've dug into the topic I was googling it and it does sound like Samsung and others are gearing up on their spending for the new processes so I would say you're probably right on the money
And that is equally
Whatever you want to tell yourself
Most traders lose money rather than make money
Once oil prices rise fracking becomes more profitable and the us starts pumping more
Those are bogus numbers to save face The only cuts are the oil from Russia opec can no longer sell and their own reduced ability to produce Russian output will also drop dramatically in the next year as their access to western oil tooling has been blocked
I wouldn t be surprised if it was because of R
did you know the usa cut production right after biden got in by 1 8 million to 2 2 million barrels a day It was one his first orders he did with in a week of being in office took 1 2 months for it to become official
Article even states its quotas not directly production Edit Didn't downvote you bud I'm not a fucking weirdo
Yup can read everywhere there's a recession going on but the price of everything is 50 higher
We printed like 80 of our total money supply in the last two years This isn't fake inflation
Sadly that s not the case in US Raises need to be constantly fought for
We finally have production generations moving ahead We've been stuck on the same production generation for too long We'll have a temporary return to Moore's law what I'm talking about for the 5nm to 3nm to 2 nm to 1 4nm I doubt this will hold out for long I will still enjoy a few years of faster growth That said I'll buy next year and hold on for 4 years
I day trade daily investing in general is a waste of time if you aren't a millionaire with disposable income investing right now is even stupider unless you are on a 5 year outlook but you do you man
There are easily available strategies that are 60 to 70 percent success rate you can also create your own mental rule set with experience and be even more successful As long as you stick to a strategy and don't piss your money away it really is a legitimate occupation
That's because a lot of people try to play news and feelings rather than charts and strategy learn support and resistance based on the float of the stock and you'll be good and able to guess bounces 60 of the time as long as you look for good volume and engulfing as it crosses the resistance close above etc So know what you're doing lol But most do lose rather than earn I agree to many people think it's easy going into it and just throw their money around that's why almost nobody is profitable in their first year it's not for everybody and I'm not saying it is but with learning and dedication you can make a lot of money even on a small account in an options trade a few dollar move on TSLA can make you hundreds while only risking 300 I know because I do it I'm not telling people to trade I'm telling them not to take advice from random people on reddit do your own research and learning and make your own decisions
I heard this several times but I'm not sure ij the details How does fracking specifically become more profitable than other forms of extraction Is it just because it's the US that's doing it or is it something inherent to fracking as an extraction method
Not under this administration
The issue is refining capacity right now not oil and gas extraction No amount of fracking will help the refineries process more oil and to building new refineries or increasing their capacity takes time years
Not possible as expansion of fracking on federal land that was previously enabled has been banned There was also a correlation in that ban with a speculative price 't occur
Not at all that equipment doesn't wear out quickly
Well it is
Russia's input has diminsihed to almost nothing since June July so why now And the other nations could ramp up production a bit and there would be no need to reduce production of 100 000 barrels per day
No they didnt so quit with the BS please and thanks Oil production in the U S in President Joe Biden s first year was on par with 2020 and higher than in two of the four years Trump was president To add to that with the persuasion of 1 President Donald J Trump OPEC cut oil production by 9 7 million barrels per day in May June of 2020 then slowly increased production until April 2022 expiration date
What's the difference
It also states that their cut of 2mbpd will translate to an overall production cut of 1mbpd So it is a production cut in effect Edit LOL love the old I was proven wrong so downvote
Corporations are posting gang buster profits right now and have shown 0 signs of stopping Despite new cars no longer being ridiculously scarce used car prices are still double what they used to be prepandemic and show 0 signs of coming down The average price is 33 000 dollars right now 33 000 For a used fuckin car Average price prepandemic was close to 18k Many companies that raised prices due to supply constraints don't have those same supply constraints and are still not pulling down prices because they've learned that people can and will still pay to not fucking starve It's not all fake inflation but there's absolutely a fuck ton of fake inflation caused by ridiculous corporate greed and so many people don't know about it and it's infuriating Corporate profits are at a 70 year high even adjusting for inflation during that time Anyone who doesn't think there's a duck ton of fake inflation caused by corporate greed right now is ignorant or delusional
It's also not entirely real inflation given that many corporations were raising prices and reporting record profits True inflation is probably a few percentage points lower but it'd still be bad either way
I day trade daily investing in general is a waste of time if you aren't a millionaire Just keep digging that hole deeper to show how dumb you
do your own research and learning and make your own decisions Is that not what I literally said in the original comment you disagreed on me with Lol just another case of Reddit arguing for the sake of arguing
Fracking costs more to extract oil than other methods As prices rise it crosses a threshold where fracking becomes profitable and more operators resume or begin production increasing supply and stabilising or dropping prices in theory
The soil in america contains lots of oil but it's not possible to extract it without fracking Fracking is more expensive to do so the oil needs to be sold at a higher price before it becomes worth extracting that oil
It doesn t get more profitable the price spiking makes it such that fracking is just able to turn a profit as fracking has high costs to bring that oil to market At that point because all that fracking oil comes to market the price of oil will likely stabilize since there is more supply It s a balancing act for OPEC to have the price high enough to turn a profit but not high enough to lose substantial market share to American fracking operations
It doesnt it just becomes viable to do it when the price goes up when oil is too cheap its not worth the expense to do it
It isn't more profitable It just becomes profitable which allows it do we done
Deliberate action to increase despair in Europe I think Putin is also trying to increase price of oil to increase russian profits from sales More money for them means more money to support war I hope Germans learned their lesson for short term but also long term future and will never ever try to make themselves fully dependent on one country for fossil fuel supply Although i really don t like what are they doing right now They bought electricity from my country for 80 and their energy merchants are now offering us the same electricity produced by our plants for 500 for the same amount of units they bought I think electricity needs the same regulation as stock market
Not to mention that the thing that Biden called for pausing leases on NEW oil drilling in the US was struck down by federal courts anyways and never took effect Also the whole we were energy independent under Trump is a load of horse manure too just to head that off We were energy independent because we sold more fuel sources than we used IE we sold more coal to China and Russia than gasoline we bought from OPEC But at no point were we actually energy independent in the sense that we didn t have to import fuel The energy independence under trump is still in effect today
The quota is the max they're allowed to produce Reducing quota reducing production if they're already producing well under quota
This comment right here You took the words right out of my mouth It's really amazing at how some corporations and people live in totally different worlds right now Imagine everything costing more people going broke left and right but executives lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills and drinking 5000 bottles of scotch on the daily Absolutely wild out there
Uh that's not how that works When inflation is high and accelerating corporations need to raise prices to make up for prices that will hit multiple months later It's not driven by just corporate greed So you can't just hand wave it away by pretending it's not part of real inflation Also just as we lose purchasing power corporations lose purchasing power also And their suppliers all suffer the same forces so they raise prices in excess of what they need to to anticipate inflation which each and every single company does down the chain imperfectly So even if there are record nominal profits it does not necessarily mean profits are at record levels in real terms I'm not a fan of corporations but it doesn't mean I listen to a lot of the lies spewed by politicians either
Lol it's overall macroeconomic trends Go back to school
If you think the reported inflation number is higher than the actual inflation then you're ngmi

What is the difference between i and p
I guess you could technically run crysis since win98 supports dx9 I bet it gets seconds per frame instead of fps though
Sadly not possible Crysis requires SSE instructions in order to start There is also no motherboard for this CPU with enough RAM The hard minimums are Athlon XP or Pentium 3 For SSE
Yeah chip was actually a clean sheet x86 chip so technically it was neither a 80486 or a Pentium That fact the chip needed its own special chipset and didn't have an onboard FPU kind of doomed it The AMD version rectified most of those shortcomings and was a pretty good chip This was all happening during the heat of the Intel vs AMD x86 lawsuit so AMD was hedging their bets with NexGen Eventually those engineers went on to help design the K6 and Athlon
P75 rating is not exactly true Sometimes it performed on the level of Pentium 60mhz FPU heavy loads It was mostly in business applications It was a niche market And there was alot to gain in there You where able to release a CPU that did not fully compete with Intel for example but compete enough or sometimes even faster on business based tasks while not having the need for gaming and such
3 weeks
350nm vs 5 7nm transistors makes a big difference
The first and somewhat rare Pentiums were 5V

Talk about future proofing We're just at 11 and it's good for 95
Linux worked fine on these Cyrix chips were the nightmare Eventually they did add patches to work around most quirks in Linux
Haha I ran Slackware on this CPU no problem It maybe it was the latter one with 3d now
This CPU is actually older than socket 7 lol You're thinking about the K5 or K6
For windows 95 lol Wow They all branded their products to up their sales People where told back in the days that windows 95 would only run on Pentium CPU's
Same Bought a board chip and 8 MB of RAM for like 225 which was a steal back then I look back on that computer very fondly Lots of people in here have absolutely 0 idea of how far back in processing it is
saluting face
Probably won't run any OS past windows 2000
You where able to bypass such checks by simply installing a OS on a modern day system and then pushing the HDD back into a much slower machine as above It would boot and run But due to the lack of proper instruction sets like MMX and such there's hardly anything you can do with it There are some video's where people managed to get windows 2000 running on a 25Mhz i386 or something
In Floppy disks or CD Rom
Nowadays AMD CPUs need either a dual tower or a 240mm rad to even boost within specs lmao
I have the ADW and ADZ versions The ADW can stand up to 55 C and requires a heatsink and fan The ADZ can go up to 85 C and doesn't require that Both should be able to go to 160MHz in their respective conditons
Measured in frames per minute fps is pretty optimistic tbh
This is a very old CPU and this post is a joke
Test it side by side with Windows95 ofc
The Score will be 5000 grinning squinting face
I don't think that much time would be enough I was doing 3D rendering on Athlon XP 3200 back in the day and it would take up to 10 hours for a render in Bryce3D
This chip is based on 486 it will be good for Doom and is unfortunately poor with Quake unless used with a 3D Accelerator
I remember playing UT on a similar system It ran significantly better in a 150x100 window lol
I used to have this exact CPU with 8 MB of RAM In SIMMs I can tell you that Doom Doom II will run but because the CPU handles graphics the view window will have to be shrunk down for it to be smooth Not a ton but still It will also struggle to decode an MP3 smoothly It was a great deal at the time but still lacked the little bit of umph needed for tasks we today consider to be trivial
Mono 64Kb s I'd find the threshold
I miss S3 They were on the verge of becoming the best video card company but then later got savagely beat by Nvidia and ATI
Also sometimes struggles even with mp3 Like sometimes noises appear when playing mp3 files using winamp2

Here's the catch You run it with the highest end gpu possible drivers compatible with a pci to pcie converter thingy Wait does it even have PCI
Crysis s box does say it support win98
That's an entirely different CPU NexGen's Nx586 OP's photo is that of an Am5x86 an AMD made 486 chip It was just a higher clocked version of their Am486 DX4 just with a higher internal multiplier and always having 16 kB of write back L1 cache But it was given a 5x86 name and P rating to imply it could compete with the early Pentium CPUs And to be fair in integer operations it mostly did compare well to the Pentium thanks to the much higher clock speed But FPU performance was a different story Unlike the Nx586 the Am5x86 did include an on chip FPU all 486 DX chips did it was just slower than the FPU inside the then brand new Pentium It also didn't help that Quake launched around that time and made heavy use of the new FPU instructions introduced with Pentium Before Quake hardly any software one was likely to run on their PC at the time made heavy use of an FPU So most consumers didn't even care about FPU performance But with Quake and the coming era of proper 3D game engines that changed almost overnight
for 1 frame
Some of the older 486's didn't even need heatsinks
Yeah like look in the bottom right
I upgraded from a 386DX40 to this guy as well Maybe a lower clocked one I think it was rated at 100Mhz I remember it being the first time I'd had to use a CPU cooler and I just plonked it on there with no thermal paste Ran fine

Thank you I think of ant static wrist straps every time I see someone holding a modern expensive CPU Even holding a chip by the sides with just fingertips is better than this picture
Note that this is not a fair comparison because modern OSes demands much more power than older ones do and the chip was specifically designed for Windows so I'm giving super unfair advantage to Windows95 here I'm just curious if modern lightweight Linux with full bells and whistles could at most run slightly faster than Windows95 on ancient hardware or not
I m sure it can t even run because there s not even ram or display resolution to render it Lol
In R15 it would be about 20
Yeah my Pentium 133 non MMX couldn't make Quake
lol I remember trying to run Doom on a 386DX 40 and the window had to be like the size of a stamp Was totally blown away seeing it look so smooth to my eyes anyway on a 486DX4 100
I see what you did there
I miss S3 They were on the verge of becoming the best video card company but then later got savagely beat by Nvidia and ATI I had a S3 Savage 4 which let me game for years until I replaced it with a Geforce 2 MX 400 iirc
Also sometimes struggles even with mp3 Like sometimes noises appear when playing mp3 files using winamp2 My AMD K6 2 380 struggled to decode MP3s while doing anything else like playing AoE2 It wasn't until I upgraded to a Athlon 700 that I could play games and have Winamp playing music in the background lol
Excuse me while I buffer a reply
I wonder how many months would it have taken to transcode a dual video cd to the realvideo format Now I think lots of the issues were caused by the lack of the DMA transfer support by the Socket 3 platform PIO on Windows ate a lot of the CPU Regardless that's how I got to watch the Matrix
My first Big Screen TV was a 1080i rear projection RCA that had HDMI ports that I purchased brand new in 2005 2006 It was enormous but didn't actually weigh very much It was surprisingly light weight for being 6ft tall and 8 feet wide by 2 5ft deep I remember playing PS2 and OG xbox on it when the OG 360 released we finally upgraded to a 40 LCD I had a friend who had a flat screen 1080i CRT Sony that actually looked really good for what it was lol we also had a projector that had the first generation of HDMI and we used to connect the 360 to that and put it out on the balcony pointed at a row of ceder trees that we used as a 50ft x 30ft screen lololol the 2000's were crazy
yes but nothing to do with being analog or digital It was a way to sort of cheat and get the illusion of 60fps 500 lines
1 per minute
yeah they had pci slots but video cards used AGP
Older ones yes The higher clocked did need a heatsink Even a 386 25Mhz came with a heatsink

I'm Sorry Automod
The main kicker is that Cinebench R20 is a 64 bit program
Ik this is a joke and still too high 52 is what i got on a mobile 2008 Pentium SU4100 2x1 2GHz Yes using the laptop is a blast
So faster than the Intel Atom CPU I have in an old NAS then That legitimate scored 9 12 depending on the run
a 133Mhz Pentium should have pushed Quake around at 320x200 at somewhere around 30fps which isn't amazing by modern standards but for the time that was certainly into the that'll do territory
what 3D card you using
I should have said at the time I can't remember the card it was something like 1998 Maybe It was not a 3DFX it was openGL I think and 2 version existed 4Mo of Vram or 8Mo of Vram I had the lesser one But I can't figure out what was the card It was sold with a free 3D game where you add to stop an alien invasion by blasting UFO with a cannon
I also did the Savage GeForce 2 path but I don't remember which models They were both great for their time though I didn't have much to compare them too Before the Savage I had the original Voodoo It was nice having so many 3d options back then
real men used audio CD's back then
Oh I was able to listen MP3s while reading some stuff doing office work or playing light games when I got my hands on Pentium 200 MMX It was even able to play MPEG2 movies without a hitch DivX movies were stutter show though Unless the resolution was very low
1080i was so bad for fps games you could see the crossairs in the middle get out of alignment when you turned around I used 720p instead over that
This CPU is from before AGP was a thing It's a 486 class chip Motherboards for those sometimes didn't even have PCI but VLB and ISA or EISA slots AGP didn't make it's debut until a couple years later with slot 1 and late socket 7 motherboards
It wouldn't even be able to run it anyway since it doesn't support 64 bit instruction sets If I'm not mistaken The Cinebenches R15 and newer all require 64 bit processors Someone ran one recently with SuperPi 1M earlier this month on hwbot and got about 28 minutes For reference more modern CPUs can usually run this in under 10 seconds with the top speeds being a bit under 4 seconds with those 13900Ks at 8 GHz
The only thing blasting is that poor CPU fan who didn't sign up for any of this and is doing the equivalent of the digger who was digging Evergiven out of the Suez Canal
It's a beast in Folding Home 400 000 Ryzen 5800x3d 265 000 Ryzen 5600 190 000 Ryzen 3600 60 000 i7 3770k 20 000 i5 4200m 300 Atom N570
At that time I wasn't thinking like that My display was 800x600 so it was what I tried to play
Rendition Verite
After some magic we were able to watch the DivX movies on the friend's 233MMX more or less smoothly I think I managed to build some early version of the FFMPEG library and the console based mplayer player on Windows Maybe Not so sure I remember that manually enabling the UDMA33 on the CD ROM drive and changing the old cable to the new 80 wire one to keep it from crashing helped tremendously
So you re saying some enterprising soul needs to build a VLB to PCIE x16 adapter XD
Have you seen the heatsinks on those The p1 era had tiny ones tdp was only a few watts anyway
Fan is doing fine TDP is like 10W
It's an N270 which interestingly according to ARK is not 64bit but windows 10 has no issues running 64bit on it
I knew it the lower the number the better I wonder if there is a CPU out there that can score 1 and take 1st place
Oh god yeah nah nothing at the time without hardware acceleration was getting that out of Quake a Pentium Pro II would maaaaaybe have pushed 30fps at 640x480 if anyone in here has a machine of that vintage and could do us a timedemo demo2 in software quake that'd be sweet I very clearly remember getting 43 5Fps out of my overclocked Pentium 166Mhz MMX 262 5Mhz again at 320x200 though
Oh maybe I just remember the Vram ships where on the right just like that But I can't AGP came later and I was stuck with my Pentium 133 for many years dad's computer it was a Compaq
I did a little search again it may have been a matrox mystic The name ring a bell All I remember is my deception regarding the performances
Oh Nice I just gave up I think I overclocked the CPU to 233 mhz and tried different versions of media players but that didn't help much
You'll get maybe a good 150 points in F H with that monster Btw intel can't be trusted on these things they don't want anything to do with them Mine is a 64 bit cpu but there are not much of drivers available for it and it only ever bundled with 32 bit windows 7 Its GMA 3150 gpu supports at least OpenGL 2 0 but intels driver department apparently doodled dicks all day because there aint no god damn OpenGL 2 0 supported That ark page was probably written by a hungry monkey
I remember playing quake at 800x600 on my 233MMX with a crap 3D virge but don t recall any specific framerate since it has been exactly 25 years since then It was playable for sure and even felt fluid but then again I was stoked I could actually even ran 800x600 and my standards were much much lower back then In the early 90s as a kid I played Vette with 1 fps on my PC XT 10MHz CGA
Yeah I agree it's atrocious The first digit should always indicate the architecture generation
For anyone saying who cares this naming scheme means AMD could put out something like a 8530U Anyone casually looking at laptops would see that and think oh it's an 8000 series it's Zen4 on AM5 while in actuality it's a Zen3 chip It's unnecessarily overcomplicated and very easy to intentionally or unintentionally mislead the customer First number should indicate chip architecture always That is the standard that has been in place for decades now and to change it up like this is suspect at best
Zero problems on AMD making new chips based on old architecture dedicated for low end budget and entry level laptops But this naming scheme is designed to intentionally fool the consumers thinking they got the latest processors Just look at Asus zenbook 14 or 14x not sure They have a 5000 series of it then a 6000 series And now they have a 7000 series coming but a 7x30U Meaning the newer one is actually worse than the last one and its literally marketing the laptop from 2 years ago as the latest one Mindfvck honestly Edit 2nd paragraph is wrong 14 and 14x are different
Never understood why they don't just name them the exact same as the roughly equivalent desktop part just with a naming prefix to indicate it's a mobile CPU and the suffix to indicate the Form Factor TDP variant Then again I have no fucking idea about marketing I do real
Zen 1 Zen and Zen I mean I'm happy with my Ryzen 1600AF and 3500U both Zen but it's absolutely insane to have Ryzen 7000 series CPUs using architectures that were seen in Ryzen 1000 2000 and 3000 series It was already screwed up to have Ryzen 3000 mobile CPUs using Zen but this is utterly scummy
You need a guide to figure out what to buy It's very clear that this new naming is very much in AMD's favor and seemingly designed to obfuscate what the consumer is actually buying Five separate mobile processor families Four different processor architectures Four different manufacturing processes A mix of graphics technologies from the last several years Differing I O and memory offerings When it takes several paragraphs just to lead readers into what AMD is announcing in the mobile Ryzen space something has gone wrong
Every laptop part basically It's either this or parts that vary greatly but have the same name Like oooh a laptop 3060 Is this the 140W version or the 50W version Let me dig through massive piles of documentation and get only vague answers
How else are they going to get rid of the excess inventory of zen 2 3 etc Confuse the vast majority of not so well informed consumers into thinking they are getting the latest by just naming everything 7000 series Brillant
People to AMD You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
The justification for this new name scheme just baffles me corpos really think we that dumb
Nah it's better than 5500u and 5600u fiasco One of them is zen 2 and the other is zen 3 Now at least you know what gen you buy Segment part is utterly useless though
Idk the more I get used to it the more I like it It kinda makes sense
This isn t for consumers It s for laptop manufacturers so that they can market absolute newest parts with newest CPU architecture and updated older parts using predecessor architectures without looking like they re using last year s or even older processors It s now easier to update a laptop chassis from a 6800HS to a 7830HS and make it look like a 2023 part Though there are SoCs that offer tangible upgrades like Zen 2 RDNA2 even with an older CPU architecture I get why this is being done though Silicon at the leading edge is expensive so Zen 4 mobile will likely not reach mid range until 2024 s 8000 series So in order to hit market price points a mix of architectures and lithography nodes are being used
I find it pretty easy to understand honestly Gives more useful info than intel
AMD borrowing the worst ideas from Intel
This chart already contradicts itself because Ryzen 7000 desktop were released in 2022 Why don't they do 8000 for 2023 models and go from that to avoid additional confusion
Except for the third digit everything makes perfect sense to me Admittedly it is not intuitive that there are so many different architectures within one generation but I'd like to hear a better solution The only solution would be to move the thrid digit to the front but how do you then intuitively differntiate between new and old releases not generations In either way it seems suboptimal which is probably why this name scheme is the way it is
At least it's transparent You can look up exactly what you're getting
I mean at this point its kind of impossible to turn back without upsetting the normie consumer mentality of bigger number better One segment of tech I really wished got better naming would be monitors
wouldn't that make the 7950x a zen5 CPU
At this point it s easier to decipher Zen 2 4c8t 20W than this abomination
Makes me glad I don't buy laptops
If you think this is bad you'r not long enough in this world OEM's constantly pressured for new numbers and that pressure is not in a pretty please way AMD takes a big step by putting the architecture generation in the name They keep OEMs happy and at the same time aren't lying to the end user Mostly this happens in the notebook space so on desktop we usually don't see this x200B This is way better than 5700U being Zen2 and 5800U being Zen3
It's basically the same convention that EPYC uses but with generation on digit 2 instead of 1 This misplaced outrage is made all the more hilarious by the fact that the average consumer doesn't give a shit about model numbers in the first place anyway
Wait I don't see anything wrong other than the mixing of Zen generations in the 3rd digit First digit is not confusing 2nd digit denotes tier 3rd digit is the only confusing part 4th digit is low vs top model 5th digit is known for years now U for ultrabook H for gaming pro laptops
I dunno this seems fine All of the information is made available to you and there's a wide range of options for a wide range of customers
This type of crap is why I avoid laptops Last one I owned I got tricked into getting a cellar on because I thought it was an i5 but turned out to be a dual core Celeron in the same price range
Why It's pretty simple and informative
Still has nothing on icelake mobile which has gems like the following i5 1038NG7 i5 1035G1 i7 1068NG7 Or this Comet Lake laptop tablet Xeon Xeon W 10885M Clearly more obfuscation is needed
They said they would stop doing bad consumer unfriendly practice all I see this year is they are turning it up to 11 Heads needs to roll at AMD or this stuff will not stop
Well at least there's a system to it What I can't get my head around is that a 7900X and a 7900XT and a 7900XTX are three real products but one is a CPU and the other two are GPU's What the fuck AMD
Having the 3rd number in the naming be the most important part to know what you're actually getting is mind bendingly ridiculous
I wonder what the naming convention is next year Intel's naming scheme kinda sucks as well but at least they are reasonably consistent and don't need a new key to decrypt their product naming every few years
This is the dumbest hill to die on This naming provides almost complete transparency regarding what you're buying Sorry but the average consumer doesn't know about any difference between Zen 2 and Zen 3 because it doesn't make any difference to them What matters is the value they are getting out of the laptop in which case it makes a ton of sense to sell old IP on an older node For anybody who actually cares the naming scheme provides literally all of the relevant information For anybody who doesn't care the naming scheme tells them whether this is a laptop sold in 2023 or 2024 Everybody wins except people who are too lazy to learn the new naming convention
It's terrible indeed Same level of terrible as Intels mobile CPU 4 digits means 4 cores and 5 digits means 8 cores
I like this naming scheme It's easy to look up which arch it's using and helps eliminate the issue with lower number old arch old CPU mindset I think this is consumer friendly rather than not For example it makes it clear that an older arch like Zen 2 is still being supported
Who gives a fuck
I can already picture gaming laptops flexing their 8 cores Ryzen 9810HX aka a power starved R7 1700
Seems just for mobiles I don t really care then they can do whatever
At least it makes sense a little
I don't pay attention to mobile so I had no idea but holy shit that Shit we thought Nvidia and AMD had flipped their shit with dedicated gpus and what they are naming them hahaha omg as a tech enthusiast this makes my head hurt Wtf is your average Joe and Sally going to think
The best part is they keep rebadging the older generations as a new part While technically you can discern what you re getting from the naming convention not many will want to remember Tldr 5xxx should be slower then 6xxx 6xxx should by slower than 7xxx
It's so enfuriating and confusing that second digit they use 3 4 for ryzen 3 5 6 for ryzen 5 BUT decided that 8 is ryzen 7 9 W
Ai am confusion
Might as well just segment by having Athlon Zen Ryzen 4c 8t Zen 2 Mendocino Ryzen 6c 12t Zen 3 Ryzen 8c 16t ULV Zen 3 Ryzen 8c 16t H series and beyond Zen 4 Bonus points if they exhume the Sempron brand for Zen 1
Treat the architecture digit as an efficiency indicator Every time this shit comes up people act as if some evil marketing director is going to ambush us with a 7920 That's just not going to happen
Hey guys what do you think of my new beast Brand new Ryzen 9 9910e
So a new 2600 3600 5600x is gonna be 7655 hx or hs Makes sense s
fuck this 'm buying
Another Massive Disaster AMD just baiting people who have little knowledge of the naming scheme Intel do it too but it's just dirty
So I have a ryzen 9 6900hs and it says 35 but myne goes to 110 135 is this normal or do I got a 1 in a million config
Congratulations AMD for copying Intel s confusing naming scheme Can hardware manufacturers be more creative with naming schemes and something that make sense to the lowest common denominator Consumers are dumb don t confuse them
Its a way amd can release older architectures without the chips sounding old with the actually important number tucked away where nobody will pay attention to it
I think this is actually worse than Intel' 's a pic as a guide
How is it that they can keep their desktop CPU names so easy to figure out but their craptop CPUs are all over the place Maybe it's because they know that most enthusiasts don't like craptops Most people I know who buy craptops don't know their butts from their elbows when it comes to tech When it comes to the tech clueless who often buy craptops they'd be confused no matter how simple the nomenclature was I guess that neither AMD nor Intel is interested in trying to make it easy for them because it would be a wasted effort Remember that naming scheme that Intel had that was so bad that Steve Burke was poking fun at them over it The same is true with phones How many people have any idea about how their phone's CPU and GPU stack up against the competition I'd imagine very few because the nomenclature of those chips is worse than the worst craptop naming system that I've ever seen Every enthusiast I know doesn't care one bit about craptops because they're overpriced and underpowered technological dead ends I have a craptop sure but there's no way that I'm spending anywhere close to 1000 on one It's just a mobility platform for me Any serious computing gets done on my main desktop rig
If you need a deciphering table that means your names are getting out of hand
So it's Ryzen 460u
soo my AMD Ryzen 7 4800H would be a Ryzen 7 4720HS
They better not be using Zen 1
They're gonna abuse this to use zen 3 and zen 4 On new chips
This is crap They're downgrading my 5600X from Zen3 to Zen0
Also e CPUs
Was fine until the 3rd and 4th digits just makes the CPU name harder to remember ngl
Meanwhile Apple M1 M1 Pro M1 Max M1 Ultra
Engineering naming conventions are the worst It doesn't matter the discipline or the industry I understand as well that this is likely marketing But I've suffered at the hands of engineering good ideas for decades
I mean most model and serial numbers are like this they just don't explicitly tell you what each digit means you have to kind of look them up or know what you're already looking for The number itself may seem meaningless or nonsensical but I suspect some amount of marketing went into this decision for example the first digit going up every year gives the illusion of progress even if you're getting the exact same processor as last year
The worst thing about this is it s done after they skipped 4000 and 6000 on desktop to line up the naming scheme then fucked that up and went to this
And I thought Intel's naming scheme was shit but AMD managed to one up them At least there I know the generation and segment from a glance
When I'm shopping I always lookup Passmark scores for the different CPUs anyway
AMD is really dropping the ball lately For starters Ryzen 7000 needs more than 16 cores It should have had 24 and 32 cores And why isn't the memory bandwidth higher like Apple's M2 series This naming convention is stupid pure and simple Model Year Have processors become cars The Marketing Segment digit doesn't mean anything to anyone Feature Isolation
MENDOCINO NEVER RELEASED THOUGH WTF IS THIS
My suggestion Have the same name as desktop But Use lowercase letters and add a m to the end
Its a bit weird people are outraged that the first digit doesn't represent the core architecture when it literally never has since the very first Ryzen mobile 2000 series Zen chips back in
Not that I'm a product naming specialist but I really hate what they did to their product names It's obviously done to sell older products but naming shouldn't be confusing to help sell I wish they did something like 55w up to 55w Ryzen 5 7600M 28w up to 28w Wattage could be only in fine print not on boxes to look cleaner A complete rework of the naming would be nice I don't think I even consider what's the digit after Ryzen means since I can't trust it Why not use that for the model year if they need to do the number must go up theory Ryzen 22 can easily mean 2022 and then you are set for any future proofing Maybe even use the CCX count currently groups of 8 cores or some other metric to show CPU or GPU capabilities That's one thing I really liked about VEGA's naming Simple Obviously for yealds not being the whole core it doesn't completely work But another option could be the total CPU count Ryzen 23 1600M 95w Or even have the last double zero columns mean GPU commute units if they are unlikely to exceed 2 columns on SoC APUs Ryzen 24 864 165w Model year 2024 8 CPU cores 64 GPU CUs with a combined max power draw of 165 This last part is obviously a little bit messy and it isn't perfect and looks busy
And to nobody's surprise the comments are half full of people defending this with you guys just don't understand this is actually a good system and most people are too stupid to know anyway so it's okay
Can t wait for the 9110e Very powerful It s 9000 series after all
Funny how people made fun of intel name and now they want it to be like intel
This only caused that I decided will never buy any more laptops with amd CPU's
I want to see a 7110e lol
How can Ace be one and Eleven
How to confuse buyers especially Laptop OEM s will abuse the shit out of this PowerHouse Ryzen 3 9640C CPU
It s because AMD is dumb and has to come up with a cipher for 2023 Ryzen5 Zen4 Lower Model within segment 15 28Watt premium ultrathin processor
This insanity coupled with ridiculous component prices will kill the entire enthusiast pc market
This is how it has always been but now they are just trying to explain the scheme which makes it more of a headache
This is good and easy when you know the rules I ll die on this hill
this sub is weird as fuck when this first came out anyone who complained got down voted as hell now this post is in the top post what the fuck
I like the concept but they got the digits all out of
The only reason that they come up with this naming convention is so that they can market their products better to OEMs who can sell their old devices as new What they are ignoring is that if people's experience is not good with their AMD laptop they will just go intel for their next device and remember AMD with a bad reputation which is something that AMD never fails to deliver I understand they want to profit in every possible way but I feel like they got too greedy and too early with the marketshare and mindshare they have especially in all their consumer products
x3xx Ryzen 3 check mark x4xx Ryzen 3 cross mark
9955hx is my dream mobile unit
I can only advocate physical violence at this point For legal purposes this is satire
Do they really plan to still make new devices with the old Zen 1 and Zen 2 architectures
I think that the offer of AMD laptops is so bad right now at least here in canada that I hope to see many different laptops with all those CPUs
I know a lot of people complain about naming conventions but unless someone has a better idea I m ok with this You just need a reference chart bookmarked somewhere
I prefer this over whatever the hell they had last year If nothing else this one is easy to look up which gen of chips are new and which chips are rebranded Just stick with this system over a consistent period of time please
Portfolio Model Year Hello
7640U is probably gunna be the new epyc number
This again Wasnt there a post identical to this around 4 or 5 months ago
absolutely the worse naming guide I have ever 's
I love how one of the form factors is Max Performance and then there s just Chromebook
The more explanation the more I get confuse
Most people who would be confused by this dont care to understand it anyway way They will go to a store and ask which one they need This is not the same as a single part as a gpu cpu or the alike
Will Intel and Nvidia follow suit if AMD was first to have a non confusing naming scheme Let's be honest this confusing naming scheme will continue regardless of what opinion you have on the current one
They should put architecture in front of market segment and remove the model year number entirely Then it would make sense
This actually is really brilliant But it also sucks at the same time I will say they need to add at least another digit 0 for no GPU 1 for GCN 2 for RDNA 2 3 for RDNA 3 and 4 for RDNA 5
I'll take a 9115hx pls
I see why people complain as it needlessly obfuscates things but I also think you're giving the laymen far too much credit Most people wouldn't know what a Ryzen 7 5000 series CPU is whereas every last one of us here can probably tell you every configuration of it down to the TDP They just want something faster than a Pentium that can do what computers do but faster than what they already have
Remember when these companies used to put M in the model number for their mobile parts I remember it specifically with NVIDIA putting M at the end of the like GTX 780
At this point companies are being purposely obtuse to trick consumers
This is the stupidest most self aggrandizing overwrought product management nonsense I've ever seen AMD You're very quickly adopting the very worst traits of both Intel and Nvidia Just stop it
this is a better alternative with proper legends at hand a customer can know what architecture is which as oppose to the previous naming scheme where customers had to search each individual name of the cpu to find out if it's zen2 or zen3 case in point 5700u and 5800u is two different architecture two different chip
Seems like amd and Nvidia have been going bonkers with this shit A big redflag I came across with AMD was seeing how they named different laptop gpus as the same base model when they weren't the 6800 6800S and 6700 6700S A piece of hardware with different physical components should not be named the same way Nvidia tried to do this with their new 4080s before backing off And now amd has this cpu naming scheme I've been an amd supporter since Intel screwed them over with 2005 antitrust bs and while I've cheered their recent rise to power after decades I don't like this I suppose it's intel arm time
It's better than the Ryzen 5000 mobile series with Zen2 and Zen3 randomly interspersed sequentially It's still bad but it's not worse than it was
I'm going to be the first to admit that I have no idea what the right thing to do here would actually be I'd imagine when you're making complicated CPU GPU dies for laptops the failure rates to meet targets are so much more frequent than what is acceptable for desktops So things like TDP cooling requirements die space etc are all way less optional than a desktop segment So you'd either just throw a shitload of CPUs into the rubbish because they couldn't fit into the right category so sell it as a 6 core at 15w they'd need some way to sell all this inventory So I'd imagine the SKU's would be so much more various than desktop would ever you also have price segments so it would make sense to have older gen higher core count parts in cheaper systems etc Theres a lot of use cases to cater for here more than just selling them and then also factor in OEMs might not want to do business with you if you don't have a sellable solution they'll readily take a manufacturer like Intel that would What would people actually suggest as a good system for handling this I'd say even the Zen 1 2 3 4 5 stuff alone is inadequate here Makes sense in the desktop where there is a much higher margin of error allowed along with less stringent OEM 'm legit at loss at what you would need to implement within the mobile market
You guys don't get it this is a smart system
Always google the chip name in a computer before buying
Would make more sense if they were all socket compatible
R9 5950x R9 9840hx
So the second number doesn't even matter Since it's usually called like Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 anyway
Maybe this is an r unpopularopinion but I think their naming scheme is just fine At least there s a method to the madness
the first and third number are sort of redundant unless they do Zen3 mobile CPUs for AM5
Love how they went low high end from top down then went high low for the last section face with tears of joy
The naming is annoying I laptop shopped last month and grabbed a Vivobook with an R5 4600H and even then had to do some digging to find out exactly WTF I'm getting in this APU Yes I know it's old but I only need it for work I'm a teacher so just word processing videos and emails really and it has an SSD so no complaints there
Am I really the only one who thinks that this makes sense
This sounds more like a locker
I wish gov regulations mandate them to print the Zen x on every single hardware that the manufacturer sell so that no one is going to be mislead by their stupid naming scheme especially to a normal average joe s
I mean it's just the first and third rows the other three are great I think why it's so complicated is to show it's a laptop part But that seems needless to me
So what are they gonna do when they hit Zen 10 Make up their 5th naming scheme since launch Why not just do like you did at the start and what intel are still doing for the most part and making the first digit the architecture And if you really want to make plus architectures add a plus to the end of it wow And if you really want to make last gen products with new laptops just continue with the same number yes it wont be big number better CPU to mislead customers how annoying But it doesn't matter that reddit could come up with a perfectly functioning easy to understand future proof naming scheme AMD has been hell bent on fucking over their laptop customers since day one when they decided to for whatever reason have all laptop parts leapfrog desktop by a year Although i guess they've replaced it with this official way of misleading now Great job
I see no problem with the naming scheme Adding you to me my block list lol
I can already see a last generation cpu being refreshed with the new generation and both being named in the 8000 series That board meeting was really greedy when it came up with this change
3 equals 3 4 equals 3 5 equals 5 6 equals 5 7 equals 7 8 equals 7 too but sometimes 9 9 equals 9
This is what happens when you hire marketing people that have zero domain knowledge
while the reasoning behind the new number scheme make sense and have a good basis behind it the only thing that brings its more complicated and even tech savvy its having a hard time to get a grasp of what its new or not without looking at a reference chart its like intel naming scheme on mobile which for me its another shetshow we need more streamline and less sku not more bloated products segmentations causing confusion among consumers
If you swapped the market segment and architecture positioning the system starts making sense and is less deceptive Just an example of two line ups 9590 vs 9950 9570 9750 9550 9630 9530 9550 9360 9520 9330 9350 9250 9330 9220 9220
Imaging buying a Ryzen 7110U thinking that you're getting latest architecture
This is a prime example of why engineers suck at naming things
Fully agreed this is terrible 7 means the year 2023 what the absolute hell This is some early 90s tier naming sense and of course it will entirely stop working by 2026 making it the most ill planned naming ever The market segment is awful as well architecture is all that really matters the 0 5 thing would make a ton more sense with A B like Raspberry Pi does and the form factor is gibberish People have complained a lot about the XTX having issues I didn't mind but this has got to be more misleading and poorly designed than anything Intel or Nvidia have made in years If you told me that some crook invented this to trick people into buying crap that they understood nothing about I'd totally believe it
I honestly believe they're doing this to catch up to Intel in their product names Is it a stupid theory Yes very much so But I just don't see any other explanation than that they just want to have higher numbers than Intel They did it with motherboard chipsets already so it's honestly not that unlikely
Architecture should be first then model year feature isolation market segment dosnt matter at all and form factor tdp is always last anyways
My 6980HS laptop gets to look like it's from the future now so that's neat
This is almost assuredly done on purpose so that they can sell off shittier parts to unknowing people thinking they are getting the latest technology
2nd digit has 2 Ryzen 3 2 Ryzen 5
Agreed although I sort of understand why they may go this way in some cases For a chip that's targeted toward gaming on integrated graphics you're going to be GPU bound so if you can save a bunch of money for both you and the customer by using an older CPU process that's a win win But if you name it something else customers assume that it's an old part if Medicino had 4000 series naming like Zen2 mobile customers would think it's using weaker Vega graphics It's irritating The only real solution I can think of is making the CPU arch the first digit and just put a year at the end I do like how at least every digit actually means something Ryzen 5000 and 6000 were incredibly confusing where you could get Zen 2 3 3 and Vega OR RDNA2 graphics
Maybe AMD thought it would be more understandable for the US market to base their naming convention on the same logic that brought us the date convention month day year
it' but incremental updates could be made using the last digit like the updated microcode of zen2 it's a bigger issue when we get a new memory controller or iGP but oh
Why
HELL NO The year is what you want Nobody but very avid hardware fanboys care about actual architecture but even these should be smart enough to welcome that when buying used hardware in 3 9 years that single glance tells you from what year it is Just as it was with intel for a decade when generation equaled year and you know that machine with i5 5200U came out around 2015 Unlike atrocious xeon naming So who the fuck upvotes this stupidity to abandon the year
The first digit hasn't represented the architecture generation since the very beginning of Ryzen mobile The 2700u and 2500u were Zen chips
We might need the decoding wheel that Gamers Nexus got from AMD
The issue is that they sometimes do cross generations of their mobile processors
There is no way this can be done without being messy Using old archtechures makes sense for lower performance products it doesn't make sense to use cutting edge architectures and nodes for low performance products You can have tangible improvements from generation to generation without changing the CPU core design An example would be the 7830u being clocked higher than the 6800u Or the 7320 vs the 4300u using the Zen2 cores but using a superior 6nm node with higher peak clocks and lower power consumption Same chip but different I think the issue is more about marketing than the effect on users
The first digit should always indicate the architecture generation Why
It was actually worse before as AMD had 5800 5600 Zen 3 Cezanne parts mixed with 5700 5500 Zen 2 Lucienne parts in laptops This is actually an improvement over that Least with the 3rd digit you know which architecture you re getting
Anyone casually looking at laptops would see that and think oh it's an 8000 series it's Zen4 on AM5 while in actuality it's a Zen3 chip No casual will know what Zen4 is Believe me I worked in retail at an electronics store the average consumer buying laptops is dumb as a rock regarding tech they won't even know what a CPU is They're most likely not even interested in knowing either they care more about stuff screen size and price than anything And more than likely you will not end up buying a zen3 chip over a zen4 chip because they'll be price segmented Zen3 would likely be in cheap or mid range laptops while Zen4 will come at a premium in newer models of laptop That's what always happens the OEMs will swap out their CPUs in their higher end laptops for the newer models relatively quickly while the mid range laptops remain the same for longer
How about 9710HX XD
I actually got bamboozled years ago when buying a 3500u laptop thinking it was zen 2 Turns out it was just a zen Never again
For someone who really is into hardware and knows about CPU and GPU releases it gets super frustrating when you actually talk with someone casual about it They don't say they bought a Ryzen 5900X No they say they bought a Ryzen 9 CPU but have no clue about the actual number Same when they say I got an i7 that should be enough Or An i5 probably does what I want So while the designations make zero sense for me an old i7 gets blown away by a current i5 for example it's what common people seem to use
At least this naming scheme has the architecture built in If you aren't aware enough to notice and you are happy with the feature set otherwise these differ based on laptops anyway so need to be checked separately I'm not sure it matters all that much
I might get downvoted for this But for most people that don t know they will never have any idea and will likely not ever have known with no impact to them what so ever Most of the tech the newer generations add are completely indifferent at the performance levels these chips are likely selling at The only thing that really matters is that in the stack the performance makes sense for the second digit So that doesn t mean this isn t a problem it s just only a problem if they insert a product into the stack at a higher performance tier than the chip provides I don t know if that s the case with their current line up or not But if the price and performance work out right and that scales with the naming convention I don t really care if they are older gens and neither will anyone buying one Because if they did they would have looked up the model number or reviews with the CPU they are buying and found this out If they are looking for a system in the price range these older gen cores are likely to be in they aren t getting ripped off as long as they are priced right and are getting a relative performance per increase over what it would have sold for last gen If they are reselling the same CPUs at the same price point thats also a problem What s the point in wasting resources on newer architecture with limited production space if a previous architecture on a more mature process already delivers that performance If you keep the older name it honestly may confuse the general buyer more They don t care or need to care about the tech behind a more budget tiered CPU but if they see an 5xxx series CPU next to a 7xxx CPU they are going to end up not buying it because older And the sales guy at Best Buy will have an upsell talking point Getting them to buy a CPU they don t really need Naming like this honestly makes it even too confusing for most sales guys to bother knowing or caring to know I honestly feel kinda wrong about believing this but it s true anyone that cares to or needs to know the difference will be more likely to actually look into it For everyone else they will get cheaper CPUs without and concern about what and the how they wouldn t understand anyway for performance they don t really need the cheapest CPUs are going to do enough for 90 of users
8530U looking super sweet is exactly its point Its whole point is to lure BFUs to buy OEMs stuff labeled with some high numbers
Have you seen the Intel naming scheme were a in 2023 released core i5 13600 the non K variant is based on Alder Lake while the 13600K from 2022 has the new raptor Lake cores Also the i5 13400 from 2023 can be either depending on an added B0 or C0 I agree that the Ryzen naming can be quite confusing but it s still better than what is going on in big blue country
Or a 8915HX
First number should indicate chip architecture always That is the standard that has been in place for decades now Completely wrong Why do so many ignorant people keeping commenting on this topic Fundamentally the only difference between this naming system and the old one is that it shows the architecture and that has never been shown before This seems to be confusing a lot of people so maybe they just shouldn't have bothered the people who care about such trivial technicalities know how to find out anyway
Anyone casually looking at laptops would see that and think oh it's an 8000 series it's Zen4 on AM5 while in actuality it's a Zen3 chip Lmao no one cares outside of r AMD's bubble Especially not someone casually looking for laptops 99 of computer users have never even heard of Zen They see a four digit number and as long as it's bigger than the number on the other laptop they assume it's better And from the posted naming scheme the higher number is always better isn't it
9915HX
Surprise surprise AMD just another corpo making it hard for people to know what they are getting
Anyone casually looking at laptops would see that and think oh it's an 8000 series it's Zen4 on AM5 while in actuality it's a Zen3 chip Anyone that knows what a zen4 on am5 is should be able to know naming conventions are arbitrary and set by the manufacturer
See the TGL confusions and the Y series Any naming scheme sucks because the salespeople and the consumers can barely understand the difference between skim milk and whole milk For anyone who couldn't actually compare them the 5700U is an actual improvement over the 4800U due to whatever they did with the power management firmware On the other hand the actually new 6900HX was barely an improvement in high TDP laptops because Zen3 was designed for improvements at LOW power I can't say the 6900HX's improved iGPU is a big selling point either when it is always paired with a dGPU And for good or ill this time AMD decided the next high end laptops with big dGPUs don't need top shelf iGPUs The 7940HS should be their pinnacle all rounder and iGPU chip the 7945HX for 'prosumers' and high end gamers and then U series will be an huge mess with wildly different architectures sharing the same space AMD could actually do itself a huge favor by marking some models as U series Thin Gaming or some nonsense to differentiate the RDNA DDR5 models from older architectures But in the end we have 7nm 6nm 5nm and 4nm chips all in the market at the same time They are produced in different facilities and they are the only way to rapidly increase the supply of parts in the market Buy your grandparents a 5500U laptop because they WON'T know the difference Buy your nephew a 6800U for school and light games Try to convince your wife that you need a 7945HX and an RTX 4090 for the home office People complained for years about not having more choice of models now they're complaining about having more options If you know the difference be a good friend and help those who don't have the time to keep up with tech news
I gets worse than that 7520U sounds like a midrange chip From that number you might reasonably assume it's a 6 12 Zen 4 CPU with 6 CUs of RDNA3 Instead it's a 4 8 Zen 2 chip with a mere 2 CUs of RDNA2 Calling it Ryzen 5 takes the piss it barely deserves Ryzen 3 branding The Ryzen 3 5400U is better in every way despite every digit of the part no being lower
The people who will be fooled by this naming scheme are people who would never look at these numbers anyways The performance figures of laptops parts have always been weird Like I have a dell XPS laptop from not too long ago which has a dual core i7 in it Or I think you can currently get laptops with a 4090 which runs at 35watts with no indication I would say that this new AMD naming scheme is actually pretty good sure it s weird but any enthusiasts who care can still look up the chart and see exactly what they are getting while still functional enough for the average consumer to not accidentally buy a completely outdated computer
Zenbook 14 is different from the 14x They're refreshing the Zenbook 14 from the 5825u Barcelo with the 7730U Barcelo R Zenbook 14x w Ryzen hasn't been refreshed yet
intentionally fool the consumers thinking they got the latest processors But they did get the latest processors The first digit's the year Higher is newer Obviously there's all sorts of latest processors some use better tech than others AMD's scheme is imho the best compromise It is important for AMD and for OEMs machines carrying AMD chips to be able to sell these machines If there's two laptops made this year next to each other and one has a 4000 CPU while the other has a 7000 CPU the average consumer will avoid the former even if it's perfect for their needs Whereas the hobbyists or professionals like us actually care about what exactly is in there will not be confused by this and we'll dig further into the details and benchmarks anyway
The 7x30U means it's probably almost the exact same 6xxxU Zen3 chip from last year Not a downgrade just not a real upgrade Zen3 and Zen3 share a single digit which is silly but there's no way they would downgrade to a DDR4 based laptop that requires a new motherboard design Same motherboard as last year almost the same APU The one that might trick people is Mendocino but it's basically for Chromebooks only Mendocino is like 1 4 the physical size of a 5800U so it's very cheap to make and it should compete well against Pentiums or even some i3s at the bottom end
You get some weird stuff like Mendocino which has RDNA2 iGPU's So the 3600m 3100m if it existed back then would be mobile 3600 3100 But they're now releasing a quad core Zen 2 with RDNA2 but the old name is taken
This is what makes me miss some of the 90's Oh you have an old pentium II 266 mhz Neat I just heard the Pentium 3 850 mhz is coming out later this year We're almost at 1ghz Can you believe it
There's 5 important factors for buying a mobile CPU ST performance MT performance graphics performance power efficiency and price AMD has 3 new lineups and 2 reused ones that target various points of the above so there's no quick and easy way to compare the way you could do for a GPU not like Nvidia or AMD have been honest about their mobile GPU names though
On desktop we also had the G series parts AMD finally put that into order with the 5700X and the 5700G finally being from the same generation and now 7xxx desktop parts finally ALL have an iGPU but it's not for gaming If you look at the competition they had Atom cores i series cores with high core count and superior TGL i series with better iGPU but only up to four cores They got their house into order with 'big' TGL then immediately started confusing people with 12th gen TDPs and now part of the 13th gen is actually 12th gen They also had weird stuff like the Y series parts Plainly there's piles of different chips intended for very different uses And there is no good way to present them to casual users Some professionals absolutely need a 2kg laptop with 12hrs battery life and some need a 4kg laptop with desktop like performance They will either do the research or ask for advice while casual users will buy whatever is cheap or pretty The naming schemes will never be perfect and they'll never be future proof
Imo the image is probably just a key for what each digit means so people aren't wondering why digit 3 starts from 2 No way they're going to make a Zen1 7000 series part they'd have to port the arch's to 7nm It'd be more work for no benefit
What most enthusiasts don't really think about is that average consumers rarely care about the architecture used in the product they buy they care about if it offers good performance and efficiency for the money If AMD wants to sell Zen CPUs in the ultra low end fine by me Most enthusiasts will know what they're leaving on the table by doing that But my Mom who needs a machine to send some emails and browse Facebook She'll be just fine and the laptop will be cheap The real issue here is the anti consumer naming scheme that's tricking enthusiasts into thinking these CPUs are using modern architectures If the naming was clear that these were lower end SKUs that aren't nearly as good as the Zen 4 stuff then I would have no problem with this
I m curious what voltage does your 1600AF need for 3 8GHz and how far can it go at reasonable voltages 1 35
the magic of chiplet they can mix match and it somehow works
No one will buy a 1600AF all these are mostly for small factors For example the AMD Ryzen R1600 is in the DS923 NAS
What the actual fuck These can be fabbed in different factories which happen to have plenty of capacity at cheap prices
At some point they're just going to start lumping different configurations under one model name and Notebookcheck found laptops models in the past that did that Silicon lottery go
Man those are even worse because they no longer have a different name from the desktop counterpart and the wattage isn't easily available I don't understand how they get away with that
That's not excess inventory These are newly produced chips
They still make Zen 1 chips
It's not excess inventory They're still making new chips this year with old cores
corpos really think we that dumb They don't think They know This is their mobile laptop lineup I even enthusiast members would have issues these days without having a graphic handy to walk in and be able to tell Let alone the average joe jane
Not you specifically but they know the public are that dumb Most people are not super tech focussed Average person who needs a new laptop only thinks higher number better Starting with the first number being a 7 Not knowing the third digit indicates the tech could be 7 years old It s very anti consumer
Think Every modern CPU comes with a MEMS based IQ sensor so they know you are that dumb
Does it matter how smart we are when that market segment number is pure fuckery
Segment part is utterly useless though Higher can mean more cache cores better gpu They can have multiple segments and sell partially disabled chips to increase yields
I think all 7000 series chips will be RDNA2 or RDNA3 graphics So they couldn't just use the old numbers Laptop makers for whatever reason take ages to properly discontinue older models so if you make Zen 2 RDNA2 a 4000 chip a customer could buy the old one with Vega that's inferior
Intel's naming scheme isn't good but it's nowhere near as ridiculous and misleading as this
What are you going on about Intels naming scheme has nothing to do with this
Intel's names are just gibberish This naming scheme means something you can decode it
I believe this chart is only for mobile chips
This is probably only for the Mobile segment
The year is approximate even within the mobile lineup Mendocino 7020 series was also released last year and if they release another mobile lineup near the end of this year it will probably be 8000 series
If they want to add something they should append it at the end These values should be sorted by relevance it's just silly to order them like this But let's be honest it was done on purpose to trick people in misunderstanding CPUs values
This naming key is quite difficult to find though considering it isn't something AMD is really disseminating for consumers benefit Unless you follow this subreddit religiously odds are you would never know this naming key even exists
This naming scheme only applies to laptops
That s is exactly the point The Average person who goes to buy a new laptop only thinks higher number is better Starting with the first number being a 7 Not knowing the third digit indicates the tech could be 7 years old It s entirely designed to sell old tech at new tech prices to people who don t know better very anti consumer
This misplaced outrage Some of y'all will truly defend anything
Previous to last generation where they did something similar CPUs largest number was always most significant AKA the first 7 would denote latest generation architecture Now that information is tossed into the middle so buying a 7xxx laptop could still be getting older gen arch
First digit is mostly irrelevant 4th digit is the most important and should be first the 2nd and 4th digits are related so should be next to each other The optimal numbering system is architecture core count market segment revision year tdp If spaced appropriately the digit for a particular core count can remain fixed across generations revision year is to allow zen2 to be released updated every year
All of the information is made available to you You think there's gonna be this handy chart hanging right next to the laptop you want to buy eh lol
The first digit is not the tech generation It's simply incremented every year
Consumers especially uninformed consumers usually just look for the higher CPU number between laptops and then buy it and historically that works fine The problem with this naming scheme is that a 7540U would hugely outperform a 7620U and many other examples and very few consumers are ever going to see this chart or even know that it exists I don't know if AMD would actually sell allow for models where the lower number would be significantly better nor do I know if they're actually going to be using Zen Zen chiplets in 2023 but the simple fact that this naming scheme allows for the scenario of the lower number CPU performing much better makes the whole system a bit dumb and convoluted
Just like game clocks for their gpu rolling on the floor laughing
Nah this is much better than 5600u and 5700u which are diff arct but no dirrentiator
Is the core architecture really the most important thing I'd argue the most important thing is the form factor but as that is an alphabetical character it probably stands out enough wherever it is Next most important would be the relative performance compared to other laptops and for that you basically need the generation of the chip which is here the most significant digit with the relative performance in the generation being the second most significant The core architecture is somewhat irrelevant but has been included for the informed buyer I guess and comes next The least significant digit is somewhat nonsensical IMO
Same but Ryzen 8xxx instead of 7xxx
On that subject how they renamed Alder Lake CPUs into 13th gen The 13600 and below are Alder Lake chips rebadged into 13th gen at least AMD is being up front about what you're buying even if it means you have to learn to read it
You as a consumer should it s purposefully misleading to sell older tech at newer tech prices to people who don t know the tech absolutely inside out Completely anti consumer
The weirdos who invest all their emotions into things they buy
The oldest Core architecture that will be used is Zen 2
It is quite easy for them Ryzen 9 should be better than Ryzen 3 The rest of the numbers letters Just mumbo jumbo
Yeah that bit is stupid Maybe some gens they want to have more Ryzen 7 chips than 9 and others they don't
Let me ask what's a ryzen 7 or a ryzen 9 It's totally arbitrary Like that 8
Your Ryzen 6900HS does not go to 135 watts Ain't no way
This is nothing like Intel's naming scheme
The chips even their design may be brand spanking new even if the core architecture is older
A lot of laptops are shit at actually telling you what the power limit is so it's nice to know upfront If they didn't you end up with a R9 9W getting curb stomped by a R3 45W or whatever The biggest factor that's going affect performance within a year's lineup is going to be power Also performance watt is so good now that you can use a 9W chip for daily use
Yeah should have moved to 3 chiplets

Okay theoritical naming scheme first digit is architecture second is core count third is year So a Zen4 4core release in 2022 will be name CPU442 A Zen3 8core release in 2021 will be named CPU381 Now in 2023 AMD decides they want to release a dual core Zen5 which by the naming scheme it should be named CPU523 You now have a product name CPU381 that has better MT performance than the newest product CPU523 Architecture does not imply performance

but here we are
and selling ryzen 5700u and 5800u as the same generation isn't cheating customers with this new naming system there is more information and with the proper legends it is more beneficial to cusomters
the alternative to this is to stay with the same naming scheme and sell mendocino zen2 as ryzen 8200u and low end phoenix range zen4 as 8300u
Basically what they were doing at the start First digit is the architecture If you want to make more SKU's later with the same disadvantage here is that you cant mislead and trick less technically inclined customers that think they're getting a current gen product this is good Then the second third number can mean the bin of that generation 3 4 for R3's 5 6 for R5's etc That leaves a high and low bin with an extra digit to denote refreshes or special bins There's room for 20 SKU's right off the bat If they make a architecture just add a plus after the name or a 5 in the feature isolation for instance The last digit is barely used Keep the letters on the end they're fine There you have a perfectly usable naming scheme with decades of future proofing that everyone can understand It will accommodate dusins of bins for each CPU tier architecture refreshes and special high or low end parts You're way too worried about segmentation here If they're incapable of making a chip that lets say doesn't work in a certain power segment they're obviously just not going to release it and keep working on it Whenever an architecture is made it's engineered to scale into each TDP bin For defective GPU cores defective CPU cores etc you have nigh 20 different ways to bin it until it fits into whatever R3 R5 etc category and bin you need with a fitting name It's not that difficult to do this edit another important note is the clock speeds are finalized as you bin the silicon before launch You don't first make up the core counts the clock speeds etc and then start trying to find silicon that fits It's handled together such that the product they're creating obviously fits into the product they're announcing existing And so unless the foundry suddenly produce worse silicon over time which i don't think has ever happened it's all perfectly fine
I think the problem is that they've now changed this officially three times now First they had all laptop CPU's leapfrog desktop by a year so 2000 was not actually a second gen product etc which people did not like Then the 4000 5000 series both used Zen 3 So just randomly choosing to not use the same naming scheme anymore Then the 5000 series had both Zen 2 and 3 parts with the second digit either 3 5 7 meaning Zen 2 For whatever reason again And now there's a third official name change that instantly backs them up into a corner when they reach Zen 10 unless they want to make it even more confusing or introduce letters And it prioritizes the model year which no one has ever done with the leading digit like that and therefore this is just as misleading as the 5000 series Zen 2 chips which was highly criticised ' Most likely they're gonna change it a fourth time And the most damning part is that a perfectly good scheme already exists that they were essentially using for a couple years
This naming scheme is for laptops not desktop
Until the next year rolls around and nobody will take a 7640U when they could have exactly the same 8640U
Yeah it s completely blatant in its fraudulent intentions AMD knows that the third digit used to mean minor power limit difference and they know people will keep thinking that s the case
Apart from they already do this anyway except there's no way to tell without diving into the spec at least if it'd been called the 5720U you'd have been able to tell that it was zen 2 right out of the gate as long as you're aware of the naming scheme
Actually it is probably because some high function guy in product management doesn't know how to format for sem versions I could explain this better in an understandable format
Exactly If I hadn t seen this I may have thought the same thing Zen 2 and onward are great I had a zen 1 high end laptop and it just always felt laggy Hoping my 5800x3D lasts me a little while It should
I am in the USA Air Force 2 years ago we bought these new computers that have basically AMD A10 CPU in them It's so absolutely garbage like I cannot even begin to describe how shit these computer ares The CPU is always pegged at 100 literally every second you're using it never ever goes below 100 I can't even guess how the hell they bought these things and if I told you how much they paid for them your head would probably explode The computer in question is an HP Elite desk 705G3 Mini Desktop
true Well the OEM does the selling and AMD does what OEM wants
People who can tell the difference between CPUs can already google it Most people can barely tell the difference between Amd and Intel Basically every manufacturer aside of Apple has absolutely ridiculous naming schemes You cant persuade me that any living person thinks that 14ALC05 or S2721HN are a reasonable product names
Both AMD and Intel already do
You say this like stores aren't still selling Ryzen 3000 laptops Plenty of models don't list the CPU number anywhere unless you look them up on a store's website And on the other side plenty of consumers got tricked by the i series naming scheme as well the difference between regular i7 and TGL i7 A lot of stores have completely incompetent salespeople who don't know or don't care about the difference between processors
Don't forget the 7 9
The best part of that digit is it's an arbitrary marketing number which translates to another arbitrary marketing number
It's messy but it'll probably be used to bin the Zen3 Zen3 apart from each other That and the 0 5 designations plus the letter suffix AMD could milk some extra cash out of this with an extra branding sticker to differentiate between U series efficiency and U series gaming whether they have RDNA graphics They're mostly selling all these different models because they are on different process nodes It's the only way they can increase the supply in the market
This is 100 so OEMs can pretend they have a fresh lineup each year
So a quadcore Zen4 will have higher number than an 8core Zen3 There is no singular number system that will faithfully represent the complexity of processor performance Any naming system can be abused
What about the rest of the world
I never understood why people thought month day year was so horrible
Because the year has nothing to do with performance And a small update rebrand to a chip would increase the front number barely changing the performance Does it make sense for a Ryzen 7 8730 to be worse than a ryzen 5 7640 No it doesn't
Provided you're looking this closely into it I've seen enough laptops marketed with Ryzen 5 processor and you look into it and it's a 2500U there's a reason they obscure naming like this and it's to sell to casual and business buyers Can already see it now Ryzen 7000 series laptop
Well I was trying to be a little realistic with what fuckery we could end up seeing
I think there are some limitations whereby you won't see anything below a Zen3 on a Ryzen 7 and above Meaning a 97xx would only be 2 of the latest generation i e 9730 5 9740 5 Whereas a 91xx would have either a 9110 or 9115
It's the 3 0l NA vs the 2 4l Turbo all over again Most people have neither time nor patience to learn the specifications even when it would benefit them These days I tell people to send me a picture of the tag or text me the model number if they can at least do that I'll help them out
I get what you're saying but I'll counter with the US tax code It could be simplified and easier for people who are less mathmatically inclined to understand it But it isn't which makes it more complicated for the average person to take advantage of while people much better off can hire people to take advantage of it easier The same thing applies here It could be more simple so the average buyer can understand what generational product they are buying Or it can be convoluted as fuck so that the average person is more easily duped It's about what's best for the consumer not that a business cares
yeah that's what I said
What does BFU mean
Yeah but what about Intel S
We are talking about amd Intel doing stupid shit doesnt make amd better or less stupid
but it s still better than what is going on in big blue country Considering ALD and RPL has near identical IPC no AMDs BS is worse key c421fbdb468257681c4ffb11ea566516 A 13600 based on RPL at the same frequency and L3 with the same core count would have performed near identical as the ALD one will The main benefit of RPL is higher frequency headroom which means nothing for the locked chips You are getting the same performance and Intel isn't trying to pass off a lower performance chip as something better Which is probably why they didn't bother creating a lower CC RPL variant there simply was nothing to gain
At least with Intels naming scheme you know that bigger number faster CPU within the same generation While AMD can sell you a 7000 series CPU with a bigger number thats quite a bit slower than an other 7000 series CPU because the last 2 digits are most important
Isn't this exactly how Intel names their CPUs 13900 700 500 300 13 year revision XXX higher is better
Confusing and potentially misleading naming schemes are okay because it wouldn't affect enthusiasts is not the amazing argument you seem to think it is
Somehow I agree I myself have no problems with this My friends dont even know what AMD is and the only thing they know about intel is i3 i5 and i7 zero knowledge about generation It just doesnt feel right how easily brands can get away with marketing old stuff as new ones even though I am aware of that and have no business buying those laptops Maybe thats the new normal lol since intel and nvidia are shady too especially this CES
Isnt that the same Still vega graphics and ddr4 Only 7020 seems new ddr5 and rdna2
6000 series chips are 7035 rdna2 ddr5 5000 series chips are 7030 vega ddr4 If you are talking about the zenbooks i have already indicated that I was wrong and 14 and 14x are different laptops Tho zenbook 14 5000U from 2 years ago is now marketed as new with 7030U
Lol the Pentium 4 killed the ghz race 3 2ghz but outclassed by the p3 at less than 2ghz
There is always the possibility to have super long product names that contain all the information but nobody understands anyway You
Yea I can't find Zen1 parts but there are Zen 2 6nm parts like the R3 7320U and the R5 7520U So they have ported Zen 2 to 6nm and paired it with the Radeon 610M which with just 2 compute units seems rather bad for the R5 7520U It'll be slower than my 3500U Vega 8 for graphically intensive apps and games
good performance and efficiency for the money The older architectures have worse efficiency Sure they might deliver enough performance to do web browsing and media consumption but they will use more power doing that than if they were based on Zen 3 or Zen 4 The real issue here is the anti consumer naming scheme that's tricking enthusiasts into thinking these CPUs are using modern architectures I agree I don't know why they didn't use the budget Athlon brand for these older architectures They could've had Ryzen 7000 100 Zen 4 APUs combined with Athlon 7000 APUs with older architectures I don't think that would've been fair either but it would've been much better still since budget buyers likely expect some drawbacks compared to mainstream products
The problem is that the average consumer doesn t actually know anything about performance or efficiency The only possible benefit to using an older chip over a newer one is that maybe the older chip has a higher core count but even that is unusual If AMD wants to stick Zen 2 in 500 laptops that s just fine because those chips were amazing when they came out but they should retain their original names
Laptop manufacturers and sales people will 100 use this to trick people into buying overpriced laptops with CPUs starting with high numbers in the first 2 digits and a low in the 3rd claiming that is modern and high end
If the naming was clear that these were lower end SKUs that aren't nearly as good as the Zen 4 stuff then I would have no problem with this They have a documented scheme for their product naming That's pretty good relative to most lines of products in the market
My AE can do stable 3 85 at stock voltage the range on zen Zen is really wild I've seen AFs that can do 4ghz at 1 35 too
1 3V with LLC level 4 on my MSI B450 A PRO MAX board LLC 4 results in it drooping down to 1 295 1 292v under 100 load I thought I had a bad bin but apparently it's pretty average for 1600AFs I attempted 4GHz and 3 9GHz but anything past 3 8GHz requires over 1 32v which isn't worth it for me I gain just a bit of performance for much worse thermals I run a Thermaltake Contac 12 heatsink with 2x Noctua NF P12 redux fans push pull They're nice and silent even at full load I get 70 75C in Cinebench and 50 62C in gaming depending on the season I could get even lower temps but I configured the fans to run slower so I get a silent PC
This has been common practice for many years with both SSDs and RAM
Indeed often for totally new market segments and some with a mismatch of old and new tech At least this naming scheme brings some of the info to the forefront
For instance Ryzen Embedded can still be Zen 1 They can use GloFo to make them and have different used while with TSMC they have limited capacity
If they still make server parts with Zen1 then yes If they've stockpiled enough Zen1 that some enterprise dummy can replace like for like then maybe they've stopped zen1 by now server parts have guarantees for how long they are purchasable so plans can be made well ahead of time Zen2 is probably around for a while as that's when they really started cooking and 7nm will be good for a long time
I mean it makes sense since these process nodes are no longer cutting edge and refined They are cheap and give high yields which allows for very cheap component cost compared to Zen 4 for example
It's crazy I can go from a 2700U to a 7710U and not get an upgrade or get a minuscule upgrade to Zen
Very anti consumer to actually check what you are buying you gotta look the 3rd digit first then the second and then the last letters complete nuts
Just because the CPU architecture might be old doesn't mean that the chip isn't new and even with new features iGPU which are listed separately
They re not There s Barcelo Refresh parts available in the 7000 series lineup which are updated Cezanne Zen 3 Vega DDR4 These will likely permeate 2 in 1s and cheaper laptops where graphics performance isn t a huge priority DDR4 also saves on costs Mendocino is the only Zen 2 RDNA2 SoC I m aware of in laptops under the 7020 series it only has 2CUs 1WGP though so could not replace most Vega parts greater than 3CUs I m excluding Steam Deck as that s a semi custom part
Tell me the difference between an i7 1260p and a i7 1280p or all of Intel's 13th gen i3s At least AMD is specifically telling you that hey this chip features X core architecture and its from X year
Some of generations are I still don't understand what does GR stands for in something like Intel Core i7 1185GRE The only symbol beyond G can be G7 So it's either G7 or GRE No G5 G9 G11 or whatever
Have you ever seen their 10th gen mobile naming scheme
It does actually Take a look at what Intel does for their mobile CPUs Sorting through laptops that use Intel CPUs was a headache So many numbers and letters 'll use a previous generation example for AMD The difference between the platforms was the letter and series Desktop was no letter X or G Mobile was H HS and U Desktop was series 3000 and mobile was series 4000 With U being the low power HS being mid power and H being the high power So you had a R5 3600X on desktop and a R5 4600H on a laptop Simple Both are the high performance variants for the target platform Looking at OP AMD has literally taken what Intel has done and made it even more complex and obfuscated
Yeah like this scheme is kind of dumb but it's better than the 5000 6000 mobile series which were all over the place in graphics and process node
I believe you are correct The naming for the desktop CPUs aren t like this asinine mind fuckery Edit Yet Easier for them to take advantage of the average person at the store picking up a new laptop
ah that makes more and less sense now why so complicated
Laypeople have allways been looking at I3 I5 I7 The number after that doesn't mean anything to them Its like the serial number of a toaster If they care they care about the concrete specs like the other person said Not that this excuses AMDs behavior but the people saying that the average person would care are also not that honest
The Average person doesn't look at model numbers period They look at the price the screen size and the aesthetics If you're lucky more sensible consumers seek advice reviews first in which case the issue is moot
I would wager the average person doesn't care about the CPU number at all regardless
In theory this could happen but I think they're only doing Zen 2 and up The image just lists everything so people aren't confused why digit 3 starts at 2 According to the site even the Athlon's are Zen 2
Some of y'all will truly get offended over anything
most significant is the core architecture the most significant thing
the first 7 would denote latest generation architecture Except when it doesn't
It's easy to find And it's way better than the current scheme where the numbers are gibberish There were Zen 2 and Zen 3 5000 series that were all Vega 6000 series not only had Zen 3 and Zen 3 but also had a mix of Vega and RDNA2 graphics
Caveat emptor
The CPU architecture is not the only thing that gets improved For example the 5700U is on paper the same chip as the 4800U but they boost higher due to the matured process they have more advanced power saving features and they have multi threading
Consumers have a responsibility to make themselves informed and not just blindly think bigger number is better
The problem with this naming scheme is that a 7540U would hugely outperform a 7620U and many other examples and very few consumers are ever going to see this chart or even know that it exists People understand the problem Some people are just feigning ignorance and pretending this is all ok because they dont like how AMD are getting criticized for it and want to defend them
The higher number has never been the better processor A 4800U is faster than a 5400U A higher number has also never been an indication of a newer architecture This naming is much more honest and simple than having a 5800U be zen3 and a 5700U be zen2
The problem with this naming scheme is that a 7540U would hugely outperform a 7620U That won't happen The second digit is the primary performance indicator If they made a 7540 that outperformed a 7620 then either one or both is misnamed The third digit is primarily an efficiency indicator
I view the last digit as an extension of the 2nd digit Like the 5 will be the model that's binned better or whatever Tbh they should switch the 3rd and 4th digits Then digit 1 is the year 4 is the architecture while 2 and 3 give the tier Or they could do Year Architecture Market Segment Model Within Segment
But in reality a ryzen 7 7730 would be worse than a ryzen 5 7640 Your thought process says the opposite Or imagine a theoretical Ryzen 7 8810 which would be much worse than both the 7000s
are they actually sold at zen 4 prices or have you just convinced yourself they are if they are priced according to performance tier and this same chart is easily available in the description if online store for example there isnt any practical issue at all with selling older but completely usable designs
All that matters is price and performance If a zen4 core is better at hitting the sweet spot because it's cheaper to manufacture than so be it
Why are you simping for a multi billion dollar corporation Its normal disliking anti consumer practices especially when they come from a company that until recently was considered consumer friendly
true I was just pointing out that even in their own bs naming they cant be consistent
The only pic I have is of 112 usp drivesdk Asus zephyrus g14
Perhaps We could see this going one of two ways AMD provides incredible performing budget focused chips on older but refreshed architectures with higher core thread count to better compete with Intel's high number of e cores and lower price points by utilizing TSMCs cheap older fabs AMD tries to pass off old crap as new
Yea I just never heard of that power class and I was wondering what applications 9W CPUs could have Something RPi Like possibly Sounds awesome
But OEMs can take last year's 7640U to and start shipping brand new 8640U with zero R D costs
Why wait until next year I'm just going to start selling 9640U laptops now while all these other suckers are selling 7640u laptops
Ummmmmm yeahhh thats what i thought
Even now you can't tell everything because integrated graphics aren't part of the model number Ryzen 7945HX is RDNA2 but Ryzen 7640HS is RDNA
The 5700u shouldn't have existed in the first place
The 5700U is much better than the 4800U in terms of boosting behavior temperature and battery life Ryzen 4000 still had a lot of issues with internal power management that got addressed in the refresh Clarifying the types of integrated graphics would have been a good idea The whole deal with G1 G4 G7 was partly due to graphics yields being so poor on TGL 10nm plus artificial upselling but an i5G7 still had better graphics than an i5G4 On this chart Zen3 and Zen3 share the same third digit but Zen3 has a much more powerful iGPU The difference is marked by whether a model has DDR5 And then there are specialized variants like Mendocino which are newer but not overall better and HX chips are binned desktop CPUs with weak graphics I really hope we get to see some HS based models with large batteries and no dGPU at all but I fully expect to see mismatched designs with a 3050 onboard
7845HX SevenOfNine edition
If only there was like another digit or something between those two

Architecture number also does not represent performance An 8core Zen3 will have higher multithreaded performance than a quadcore Zen4 A Ryzen 5800X3D will have better gaming performance than a Ryzen 7900 non X
There is some benefit in seeing the model year of a laptop
OEMs would love selling those 9000 series Look how cheap is this brand new thing
I would agree if it wasn t for the fact that they aren t getting duped if they are getting what they are paying for They aren t payer for generational improvements or the latest fab tech they are paying for a performance level If they get that performance and a reasonable cost then that s all that really matters Not everyone can be informed about all things and not all people care to know more than the bare minimum These CPUs are going to do exactly what they are paying for them to do and honestly probably capable of a lot more than what the vast majority of people are going to do with them I m not saying this makes sense from a technical point But a general consumer point Case in point J C Penney was notorious for having perpetual sales A new exec came in and changed it because the sale pricing was always BS So they changed their policy to just change the list prices to the real price which was basically the sale price Sales plummeted They had one of their worst years they changed the policy back and sales when back up Perception is a dumb thing for a lot of people You try and sell an older model at the right price and people won t buy it cause it s old But rename it to be in line with current models and people will buy them It s not about being deceptive as long as the price and performance are there and properly represented in the stack It only becomes a problem if they are not selling them at a better price and trying to say they are better than they really are For these performance tiers it won t make a difference If anything I am at least glad they do identify it in the name rather than just giving them a completely arbitrary model number I do hate that this is the way it is but it is and for them and the consumer as confusing as it looks on the surface it is less confusing than keeping the older models with the same name
Nah u just touched it being intentional I say it 100 is
Big Fucking Companies but the C is silent
Intel naming is bad but they re consistently bad This AMD name change is just for no reason at all
That's not exactly fair Yeah the baseline core itself behind the L2 cache performs virtually the same so long as it's at a worse point on the v f curve but beyond that Raptor Lake specifies much larger L2 and L3 caches per core It includes mitigations and it fixes a serious performance bug in the ring bus which limited the clock speeds when Ecores were enabled hurting L3 RAM and inter core communication performance It has a much faster and less delicate memory controller There are large deltas between the two in practice A single synthetic single core benchmark with a locked clock of 2 8ghz doesn't preclude that it's just hitting areas which don't scale in those ways
Confusing and potentially misleading naming schemes are okay because it wouldn't affect enthusiasts is not the amazing argument you seem to think it is You are missing the point Non enthusiast don't get confused with these enthusiast numerology of mixing underlying architecture and product they don't know the heck is a zen 4 They don't care if ryzen 4000 is a zen 4 or a zen 2 The confusion happens on enthusiast that assume the wrong thing for the wrong reasons People attach to simple rules that were wrong in the past are wrong today and will be still wrong in the future for both amd intel nvidia and all tech that lives under the sun Otherwise if you want precise model numbers we will end up with cpus branded worse than monitors today
It sucks but yeah When I help my less technical savvy friends and family picking out a computer or other product they only really ever care about 3 things How it looks if it has the performance they need and maybe some random feature they saw advertised If most people did do more research then we would all get better products
Yeah it's a refresh The laptop didn't get an upgrade nor a downgrade
Ah so from Zen3 DDR4 to Zen3 DDR4 Right then Yeah a lot of 2023 models should be restamped 2022 models at best A dip in sales cut into enthusiasm for developing new platforms But the market at 2000 will be seeing all of the new stuff One bit of good news is that I'm seeing more laptops with 12 16GB of RAM at affordable prices now that 8GB is barely enough to edit a Word document
That's because the Prescott cores were utter garbage compared to the older Northwoods from the stupidly long pipeline to the dreadful performance per W
6nm is actually very similar to 7nm and it's relatively easy to port between them There's other mobile parts that are Zen2 and 3 6nm as is the newest PS5 revision RDNA2 is also a LOT stronger than Vega and it's using DDR5 LPDDR5 which has much higher memory bandwidth which was a huge bottleneck last generation It'll definitely be faster than the 3500U in games 7320U 3500U 7320U was 50 faster in GTA5 at the same settings I wish I could find full Apples to Apples comparisons same version of GTA5 for example but that's difficult with mobile
The older architectures have worse efficiency Sure they might deliver enough performance to do web browsing and media consumption but they will use more power doing that than if they were based on Zen 3 or Zen 4 Which would be bad if they were priced the same as a Zen 3 or 4 CPU but if priced lower then your efficiency per dollar ratio stays acceptable I don't know why they didn't use the budget Athlon brand for these older architectures I think the Althon brand reputation has been destroyed by the CPUs from the pre zen era but I do think another branding line would make a lot more sense
they will use more power doing that than if they were based on Zen 3 or Zen 4 Not necessarily Those Zen 2 parts were ported to 6nm The reason you might want to prefer Zen 2 in a laptop is because it's a smaller core Zen 3 and Zen 4 increased the pipeline width quite a bit for casual use most of that performance will be unused but the power requirements for the wider core will still be there Just in case you're interested Zen 2 pipeline is 11 wide meanwhile Zen 3 and Zen 4 is 14 wide in addition Zen 3 and Zen 4 has 2x wider load store If you want to play games on your laptop then sure a Zen 4 processor would no doubt give you better results but for casual web browsing or office work then I have no doubt Zen 2 will be more efficient
The 5700U is a respun 4800U with firmware tweaks but it's inarguably a better chip It has adequate performance and very good battery life Most people don't need the bleeding edge they also don't need a 30Whr battery paired with a 15 6in screen Mendocino should be sold as Athlon and they have the C and E series suffixes listed Remember we had the Ryzen 3200 3400G and the Athlon 3000G 3000GE We should be getting Athlon laptops now that we should have had for a long time Midrange will be a mix of nodes to increase the supply in the market from 7nm and 6nm nodes High end the Ryzen 9 should only be Zen4 5nm Dragon and Zen4 4nm Phoenix But Ryzen 5 7 will take some deciphering Ryzen 3 should only be older architectures this time My concern is Ryzen 5 7 in the U series with the 7x3xU designations There's such a huge gap in iGPU performance between Vega and RDNA2 and Zen3 has advantages over Zen3 at lower TDP The rest of the chips won't be a big deal for casual consumers
I didn t test stock voltage on mine 1 2625V 3 8GHz is what I used with the boxed cooler Got a BeQuiet Pure Rock II Slim and 4 1GHz worked at 1 3125V or so I think I didn t actually monitor the speed or ran a 100 load but it worked for gaming Bought a 5700X for 198 two weeks ago would love to do more testing with the old 1600AF but I m just too lazy and it wouldn t work with Win11 anyway I think
And sometimes even screens Check your screen model You may have gotten a cheap PANDA screen and not a LG or samsung panel Laptop manufacturers are wildin rn Always seek reliable brands and see online reviews especially video reviews
While theoretically possible chances are AMD are not going to use the Ryzen 7 branding for a new Zen part I expect a part like that might be 7110U or maybe 7210U
No mobile parts will use Zen or Zen only Zen 2 at worst
Yeah situation is bad when even enthusiasts on tech forums think latest CPU architecture is the most important thing in U series APUs and not tech process iGPU VCE
Most people look at i3 i5 i7 not even the 1st digit
Which they dropped for the current gens
The fact that you have to cherry pick disproves your statement
Sorting through laptops that use Intel CPUs was a headache How U is low power and H is high power The model number is just relative performance
It really is nuts I'm a pretty hardcore enthusiast and when buying a laptop even I have to do considerable research on the current naming of the cpu's beforehand This is one place where I have to hand it to Apple since they ditched Intel their CPU naming has been a lot easier to follow than anybody else's
This does not tell you anything about iGPU That is down to 780m 680m etc So you do have the 7945HX using 610m graphics and the 7940HS using 780m graphics
Not an excuse for deceptive advertising The first digit is supposed to be tech generation
I'm on the other side of this and I'm not feigning ignorance Those CPUs wouldn't be named that way You can tell by the Market Segment digit Most changes intergenerationally will impact performance at a given power level and power utilisation at a given performance level Given that the market segment digit sets the performance bracket the implications for the architecture digit are mostly for cooling and efficiency
Yeah not to mention the power limits playing a role
The problem is AMD already made this error although on a lesser scale They have the Mendocino Ryzen 5 7520U 4c 8t Zen2 2 8GHz base 4 3GHz boost 2CU RDNA2 And then Barcelo R Ryzen 3 7330U 4c 8t Zen 3 2 3GHz base 4 3GHz boost 6CU Vega The 7520U is misnamed right off the bat all it has is a higher base clock At most it should've been named Ryzen 3 7420U it shouldn't be a Ryzen 5 at all The regression of Ryzen 5 U series from 6 cores back down to 4 cores is flat out anti consumer It was 6c 6t from Ryzen 5 4500U while all higher number and newer Ryzen 5 xxxxU have been 6c 12t The entire Mendocino line should've gotten a different suffix instead of U since their TDPs is supposed to be a lower range of 8 15W
Only if AMD screws up the specific SKUs market segment core count a 8810 would have to have quite a lot more of cores or clock speed for example to be named that compared to an 8730
You missed the main point It is an anti consumer practice to make the naming scheme confusing It WILL lead to people buying old architecture thinking they are getting something newer It's price and anything else are a different topic
No what matters is AMD is adopting a naming scheme to confuse their customers for AMDs benefit not the customers You assuming this will lead to cheaper products and will benefit the customer is yet to be seen but the naming practice is inherently dishonest
Leaves them room for releasing a 7 and a 9 as they please in addition to the 8
astonished face Everything I'm seeing is that the G14 is supposed to have a 65W turbo mode You manually change anything to hit that That's awesome though
I suspect we will some of both
And retailers can up sell you a 8330U because it is a 8 series so it is better than any 7 series
To be fair integrated graphics at high end doesn't matter because it'd have dedicated graphics anyway
I agree but it does and parts like it will continue to be released whether we like it or not so it's better that they at least have a naming scheme that explicitly says that they're based on an old architecture
I fell into this trap nicely and own a 5700u thinking it s zen3 part
It's definitely an upgrade over the 4800U though And it's listed lower than the 5800U Unless I need maximum multicore performance I cannot tell the difference between my 5700U and my 5900HX and the battery life is excellent The new confusion will be in the xx3x series because some will be Zen3 Vega and some will be Zen3 RDNA2 The difference is whether the laptop has DDR5 And a gap of 50 or more iGPU improvement will be a really big deal to some people
I can definitely tell what the details are of this CPU from the name alone
Good thing they have that 0 5 so we can differentiate between the lower Ryzen 5 and the higher Ryzen 5
There's no reason that day month year doesn't make sense too
Year Day Month Sign me up for some chaos

The delta between Alder Lake and Raptor Lake is tiny compared to between Zen 2 and Zen 4 Now add on the fact that the Ryzen 5 7520U has only 4 cores while in every other product for years now Ryzen 5 has meant 6 cores
performs virtually the same so long as it's at a worse point on the v f curve but beyond that Raptor Lake specifies much larger L2 and L3 caches per core It includes mitigations and it fixes a serious performance bug in the ring bus which limited the clock speeds when Ecores were enabled And drumrull that is where the locked chips sits and are not affected by RPL locked i5s and i3s at the same frequency would have been near identical performance wise The performance penalty does not affect them because it is outside of the operational range they would have been configured for There simply was no point taping out a whole new die for marginal performance gains There are large deltas between the two in practice Not in this performance segment Almost all of RPL's performance increase comes from frequency and adding more e cores it's just hitting areas which don't scale in those ways No RPL is at best low singular percentages better than GLC IPC wise Meanwhile Zen 4 is substantially better than Zen 3
Can vouch for how they look one friend almost bought one of those cheap plasticky laptops because of the color and thinness it was a celeron and has 4gb T T
Oh yeah you are totally right Tho its still the same laptop from 2 years ago marketed as new for having the latest series processors
I can still remember 8gb being the dream now its the minimum and wont be enough for a lot of us now
To the house fires started by getting hot enough to start nuclear fusion
Pretty sure the Motile 3500U is gimped by single channel DDR4 and possibly STAPM limits This v ojLJpd0r3TQ is what the Vega 8 can do with dual channel RAM More FPS than the 7320U and at 1080p not 720p It's important to note that different laptop OEMs configure these parts differently My HP 3500u would simply not clock the Vega 8 higher than 500mhz in games until I used RyzenAdj to remove the STAPM limit and disable CPU boost so the Vega 8 has more headroom It now hits the advertised 1200mhz and I have 2x8GB DDR4 RDNA2 is also a LOT stronger than Vega and it's using DDR5 LPDDR5 which has much higher memory bandwidth which was a huge bottleneck last generation This will of course depend on wether it's single or dual channel And I find it very hard to believe RDNA2 with 128 shaders 4 ROPs and 8 TMUs at 1900mhz will beat Vega 8 with 512 shaders 8 ROPs and 32 TMUs at 1200mhz GTA 5 is also a pretty CPU bound game more so than others so that might favor the 7320U
Which would be bad if they were priced the same as a Zen 3 or 4 CPU but if priced lower then your efficiency per dollar ratio stays acceptable The problem is when it disappears into a laptop you have no idea about the price anymore
Yeah I haven't messed with mine too much the only thing I was CPU limited in cleared up with the mild OC
So why is it included in the picture
Apple's naming doesn't distinguish between different bins of the same die M1 Pro can mean 6 2 CPU cores and 14 GPU cores 8 2 CPU cores and 14 GPU cores or 8 2 CPU cores and 16 GPU cores You do also have to remember the correct ordering of Pro Max Ultra But overall there's much less clutter compared to Intel and AMD
Who said that
It's never been though amd has had 2 to 3 gens under the same year for atleast half a decade now
i didnt miss the point i simply disagree that it is anti consumer or an issue as long as they present the information with something like this chart
It's only dishonest if they sell old tech for the same price

You can use the integrated graphics to handle encoding when streaming leaving your dedicated open for other tasks you are doing during the stream like gaming
year month day has the extra benefit in relation to day month year that if you sort a list of dates by name they are also sorted by date
There is one Americans screwing it up by using month day year What is 05 12 2023 European 5th of December American 12th of May
When people speak the date they tend to lead with the month Ex January 10th 2023 They don't say 10 January 2023 or 2023 January 10th That's the easiest way to explain why the US uses MM DD YYYY
There is one very important support A younger CPU will obviously be supported for longer than an older one relative to one day of purchase That doesn't excuse the fuck up in the scheme but it's a valid argument
Pronounced Umpanies hence the confusion
Yes my first LAPTOP with 16GB was ten years ago already Kinda crazy
To be thorough Mendocino is the lowest end mobile segment AMD has planned right now and it uses Zen 2 RDNA2 and DDR5 its definitely new sillicon Zen 2 cores are a bit smaller than Zen 3 cores so it has value for increasing yields on low end monolithic parts
Mendocino is the lowest end mobile segment announced and it uses Zen 2 Ddr5 and an RDNA2 igpu Its brand new monolithic silicon on 6nm AMD isn't trying to trick you into using ancient sillicon The only true reuse of older sillicon is 7030 Zen 3 skus and those are not exactly horribly outdated node for node Zen 2 is perfectly fine for lowend chips and lets them have great yields
This change literally does nothing to benefit the consumer and only can only confuse them based on historic naming schemes and common sense You can believe it's anything you want but it is inherently anti consumer You should not be defending this
lol what So misleading them isn't dishonest Do you work for AMD or something
Exactly my point

You don't have to be an idiot to assume that you're buying a current gen part when it's intentionally made to hide the fact that you're not
Apparently there are enough for AMD to determine it is worth despite the bad PR they will receive from the tech journalist
Yeah lol
7045HX chips won't have very good battery anyway

When people speak the date they tend to lead with the month Not where I am from This weird order is a commonwealth thing
Support for what CPUs don't get updates regularly it's not something people expect and it's not gonna be incompatible with anything as long as x86 remains relevant x200B You can't even argue that it will be more future proof because it could be an old architecture with worse performance and features
How is this misleading
Damn dude you're still responding all these hours later Talk about sad Have the last word or whatever if it makes you feel better lol bye
They said anything 8000 would seem better than a 7000 Like that somehow makes a Ryzen 3 better than a Ryzen 9
If their intention is to hide it then why have they done so much to advertise document and demystify it
You're assumption is they intend to deceive There is no reason whatsoever why a Chromebook needs a Zen 4 chip Who is being deceived Tech savvy people They're dumbass deserves it if they can't do a simple check Casual consumers If the performance is right for their needs what does it matter the architecture
It still has a battery for the flexibility you know precisely because you can't just assume stupid shit like that

While it is called the 4th of July at least in my social circle we say what are you doing on July 4th But I'm a metrologist so I'm already an ISO8601 devotee I just wanted to point out that you're not necessarily correct in how people say July 4th In fact that might be the very rare exception to month date to prove the rule I live in Thailand often and they'll say 25th of December but we'd almost never say that it'd be December 25th
To be fair it s not weird when you look at other things The biggest thing usually comes first in everything else 10 30pm isn t pronounced 30th minute of the 10th hour 4 59 convert to other currency isn t 59 cents and 4 dollars
A couple reaaons One because of historical naming patterns being changed Two it goes against common sense The higher number typically indicates a newer or better product It's so easy to mislead this way that it has even happened for things that ARE for the consumers benefit by accident like the famous A W 1 3lb burger people thought was less than 1 4lb
That's been an issue since Intel did it with Core i3 5 7 2xxx serious and up The average consumer will see 3100 vs 2600 and assume the new one is better without ever diving any deeper into core counts or cache or how long something can actually remain at boost clicks before settling back down to 1 1GHz due to TDP It's always been by design so OEMs can advertise the next gen when they refresh a system lineup
To prevent lawsuits I'm sure The only people who would know enough to get the right parts would be the 0 3 of us who actually read this crap and not the overwhelmingly larger population of people who just need a computer
You think this is going to be put on a plaque on every shelf in every store and posted clearly at the top of every digital advertising page Of course not You seeing it here and being conscious of amd news and announcements because it's in your sphere of culture is not representative of the average computer using populace This is intentionally misleading for the average consumer
You took a very specific example that probably should buy a tablet Take 2 not tech savvy light cad and a little heavy simulation a student that like to use to play on the side Is approach would be bigger number better They have no time to waste looking up online what part number is what and they may never stumble across this chart it is not a simple check if you don't know what you are looking for If the performance is right for their needs what does it matter the architecture It is not about the need is about the expectation
It still has a battery for the flexibility you know precisely because you can't just assume stupid shit like that It has battery not for your stupid assumption it has battery as secondary power source when gaming Gaming laptops rely on both AC plug and battery for power and when battery goes out it'll downclock
Big endian tends to be natural order But sometimes it's little endian What's weird is mixing up the order Month first then day then year is extremely WTF from my perspective not a native English speaker We say Tuesday or day 10 or 16 of February or 5 of May 2024
Hey OP Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3 Be civil and follow side wide rules this means no insults personal attacks slurs brigading mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on r AMD Please read the rules or message the mods for any further clarification
So something that is already an issue is suddenly something to be upset about so much now If I go from my laptop with a 4800 to a 5300 or a 5400 is it reasonable to think that's an upgrade The 5300U is actually Zen 2 so I wouldn't even be getting a new architecture So AMD is actually making their system better and more clear Is it perfect No But it's also not worth crying about If you see an 8310 product marketed the same as an 8740 then that's worth getting upset about
Get what right If they get the performance they need then what's the problem If they don't they can return it
Average consumers don't look at model numbers They look at Ryzen 3 Ryzen 7 etc So literally the only possible target for deception is someone just tech savvy enough to look at model numbers and not smart enough to Google the chip performance Very slim market slice
Anyone who doesn't have time to do a few minutes research on expensive products shouldn't be surprised if they waste their money Also you're not going to see a 8000 zen 1 or 2 marketed to high end users And high end zen 3 chip might suit some hobbyist or pro users if the price is right You said it yourself some users won't spend time researching So they aren't looking at model numbers they are looking at Ryzen 7 and laptop marketing should buy a tablet You just sound like an asshole Like casual users don't like and need the features and versatility that tablets don't provide And my examples weren't specific at all they covered 90 of the market
Yes but then if you bring the laptop IS WHEN A BETTER INTEGRATED GPU CAN EXTEND YOUR BATTERY LIFE BECAUSE HAVING A BATTERY LETS YOU DO SUCH THINGS AS USE IT WITHOUT AC POWER Fuckers you really think just because I buy a car that can do 180mph do I always NEED to drive it at 180mph Noooooooo Because that's not how anything works
The Ryzen doesn't help either because a Ryzen 5 7640 or Ryzen 7 6800u would better than a Ryzen 7 7730
Awesome stuff That close up is a really nice pic for sure Looks so sleek
Better than when LG Ultrawide used my setup for marketing on Twitter without permission
The first photo looks like a promotional product render but real it's very cool No wonder they wanted to use it Congrats on the upgrade
Atleast they asked Some companies literally just edit it so the original doesnt even notice
Send me a 7900XTX and I'll share pics of that too
Should ve asked em for cash lol they will probably generate some revenue from those badass pics
They would pay professional photographer thousands for this Please tell you didn't give the pics for free
I guess they really don't have a marketing department
Nice I had a cool selfie from a Blazer game that Facebook asked to use And now my pic is forever in that collage video they made llol
Did they compensate you in any way for the free photography work they received 133 billion dollar company cant throw you a free processor Had they hired a photographer it'd cost them way more than a CPU Nice pic though
What s that six pin next to the 24pin
Hope you at least for some AMD swag
They should at least get you some muichandizing
Very cool they got free labor out of you and didn't have to pay
I hope you got compensated
Please tell me you didn't give the photo to a multidollar company for
So did they compensate you for this at all Not just by giving you credits that can't be all right
AMD could give him some merch at least
sweet The CPU runs that cool that it doesn't even need a heatsink Way to go AMD
Should tried your hand at asking for some money gif emote free emotes pack money face
I hope you got paid and didn't accept exposure Exposure doesn't keep the lights
Looks amazing love that perspective
Schwing
Had the same thing happen to me with a first gen ryzen APU
Congrats on being featured
Third photo looks badass
Wow you all seem to be obssesed with money and
Nice pics
Nice dude
They are really desperate aren't they
That is sick
They legally have to do this or you can sue them for using your art There have been a lot of cases and settlements where artists including photographers have had their photos stolen and used by companies The artist eventually finds out and makes the company pay up Also this is a company worth billions that has spent billions in share buybacks and they aren't even offering you a dime for your work
Very cool nice of them The build looks mad
This is the kind of community outreach you'd just never get from novideo Very cool AMD
Cool M8 Last week AMD contacted me due to my post about ditching AMD and going to Intek and politely asked me to take it down sad but relieved face
Those are some nice shots that's for sure
They did the same with me a year or so ago I was building a Threadripper server system and they ended up using the photo on their Twitter account Gotta say they are SUPER respectful of other users' content
Nice dude
Those are some really photogenic shots of the processor
Social media department up at AMD really got cut down eh
Noice
More fuel for userbenchmark's ire
Wow you must have made some good photos slightly smiling face
5000 series still kicks azz
Those are some sick photos to be fair
That is awesome
I hope they send you a swag bag Very cool you got this opportunity Congrats OP
Hey they asked for permission Sweet r unexpected
Cool but then again I don't think I'd appreciate it that much considering a huge corporation is using my pictures for free for their advertising and marketing and make a profit of my back but hey maybe that's just me
Nice
Nice So how much did they pay you
They should compensate you somehow Usually they would pay good money for photos like these
Definitely should have got paid for this
Does that CPU not use all the pins
My recent build has the same 'm trying hard to realize the advantages
That s awesome man good for you smiling face with open hands
make um pay otherwise they're trying to make money off you for free and they lie about how many processors were in the fx 8350 there was a big class action suit
ya you made them a
Maakt niet uit het is gebeurd en je wist dit ook niet
100 it looks like an official photo
DMCA takedown filing time
It's got the Logo the AM5 of the bracket thecool angle the lighting is good Yeah it hits all the notes you could want really
I'm pretty sure that by law you need to ask before using someone else's photos Unless you explicitly license something it's generally all rights reserved That's why you see sites like Wikipedia being so explicit about content being either public domain or under a Creative Commons license
This sub will explode in anger if they just rip off OP's content without permission
Neat stuff
It's beautiful smiling face with heart eyes
Monstrous dude trolltrolltroll
Big companies like that they have people in payroll for these kind of materials Nothing could really stop them from recreating a similar shot and giving zero credit But op at least should've asked for some swag the kind you can't usually buy which is why it's very cool to own
They would certainly pay thousands for official product photos to use in pamphlets and on the website but these aren t official product photos It s a single social media post They don t have any rights to the photos for anything beyond giving a shout out
dude got his username in the official amd twitter he got paid in exposure
I also love the third comment on there complaining about inventory
You are getting downvoted but I agree in that AMD should at least send the person something T shirts hats something OP has every right to not charge for their work but AMD taking the time to send them out something at least shows a little appreciation
133 billion dollar company cant throw you a free processor he literally just bought the highest end consumer processor they sidegrade or require a totally different motherboard and configuration to use ie EPYC
You misunderstand how these work Anyone can take a photo like this OP certainly did a good job The value is saying it came from the community and recognizing people Not the picture itself There are definitely some custom builds and what not where there is uniqueness Source I was the one who used to ask for permission to post these on AMD social media
OP is lucky they even asked for permission let alone pay them I get it it seems like free work but the value of something is always down to supply and demand If OP said no they would find someone else on some social media to say yes for free
Optional PD power for the usb c port
I agree with all of this If a brand asks to use your photos you should get paid for it
Damm chill a bit I would take this as more of an amd employee seeing something cool and wanting to make a post on it If OP was so hard pressed to get a dime for that photo he could just ask for compensation
Eh you're over thinking it It's a twitter post It's not like their official promo material They credited him in the tweet anyway
I don't think OP should be paid like a professional photographer They didn't hire them to take the photo They just wanted rights to use it I think it would be more like a stock photo not a professional portrait Stock photos cost a few bucks because their pictures looking for a buyer Professional photography costs exponentially more because it is a subject looking for a photographer To imply that AMD should pay OP hundreds or even thousands of dollars like they would have if they hired a photographer to shoot this is silly No offense to OP but this pic while very cool would cost 10 on a stock photo site Is AMD going to send OP a 10 check I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that 10 isn't really affecting OP's life much If AMD were cool what they should do is send OP some cool swag as a thank you I can't speak for OP but I would want a package of cool swag way more than a check for 10 Plus you know they have tons of that shit and it would cost them next to nothing to send a package out to OP
Proof
For a sec I thought it was a render D
gotta get them bags
you do need to but many companies org people do not
Not sure why you re being downvoted If you pay money for a product take time out of your day to take professional looking photos and the company you paid for that product wants to use them in a promotional post that nets them more money you should be paid
Seriously some people way overestimate this I work at a company with hundreds of millions in revenue not US and shots like these are mostly done by our dedicated graphic designer photo guy Hell even I step in sometimes for a product shot or something because I shoot on the side as a hobby when it's needed You really don't have to pay thousands for an overqualified professional for a macro shot of CPU for Twitter lol We only do a bigger production when it's for a larger campaign promo
If they have photographers on payroll why not use those pictures on marketing instead of all the renderings Let them recreate and not steal pictures from customers for free In my humble opinion for profit companies should not get anything for free especially from their customers Trading the pics for swag he potentially want's would be ok but if he does not want swag its not Stealing from gullible people who don't understand their value
This is a r choosingbeggars reference right Right
Absolutely wild that an obvious joke gets downvoted
How about a GPU to go along with it
Does this require a psu change or does this adapt from an existing cable on current ATX psus
It's their official Twitter account though Doing promotional work And that's not official promotional material Social media really does give people brainworms huh
Sure Here's the video I made
You can ask for it but they re doing the right thing by getting permission to share it He gave it It s that simple The reality is he would have had a hard time actually getting any consequences if they just jacked it and posted They did it the right way he thought it was a cool moment that justified work he already did for his own entertainment and they shared it He s not obligated to demand money to be linked in a twitter post
100 this is free marketing for them I d at least ask for stickers or a shirt
It's not that deep not everything in life has to be a hustle Someone who works for AMD's social media liked OP's picture and asked for permission to repost it OP was fine with it and agreed to it end of
They do renders as well I've personally done a couple for them as a contractor You have much more flexibility when making a render than when shooting it For the content I've produced for them I've done both shooting and rendering Shooting can be faster but the more control you want the more time you need Also because of the camera equipment some kind of shots are just unattainable Trading the pics for swag he potentially wants would be ok but if he does not want swag its not Ultimately op must have not want anything as they seemed to be happy just being credited I agree that they should've get something in return but I can also share the excitement of being noticed I have plenty of hobbies I don't get paid for that I would love a shout out by one of the big industry players even if it was for free because I'm not in it for the money
It's obviously sarcasm Exposure to a reddit account will almost assuredly make you zero money
It's keyed for 6 pin pcie
AFAIK it's simply a 6 pin pcie connector
Gottem
I doubt that they could just get away with copyright 't matter to them but still
You speak sense my friend But you must be wealthy if you can do something for no money I'm working my ass off on night shifts and barely making a living
not really obvious because a lot of people are desperate for attention to those people it means a lot if they can tell people a multimillion dollar corporation used their photos edit multibillion and he didn't even get a shirt
Oh ok thanks for this information
Do you know how much work it would take just to get the post taken down let alone any consequences
MOBO manufacturers are taxing the early adopters that's one of industry's worse kept secrets
AiBs are obviously trying to get more money we went through it with b550 too a couple years ago it actually was worse that this
Q2 2023 A620 comes out so its more when AM5
That's mid 2022 money It's almost December now
Over here in Europe it's hard to find anything even under 200 Euros I looked for a while and I found only two models one of which is only technically under 200 at 199 99 Note US Dollar and Euro are currently very close to parity and have been hovering somewhere around 1 to 1 for most of the year
The only thing stopping me from upgrading is the insane motherboard prices my x570 aorus master cost less than a pretty basic b650 board and thats just insane
We need B650 Founders Edition
125 in prices of 2010
You'll start finding that in Q2 2023 minimum
The secret ingredient is crime
starting from not capped at x200B also early adopter tax
elephant in the room x200B 125 is not cheap for the cheapest board in a lineup
I love it that when we're complaining about AMDs prices being too damn high we're talking 30 more than the competition on a new product with early adopter tax and a 3 5 year platform support vs 1 2 Meanwhile we have Nvidia over here raising the price from the 3080 to 4080 by 500 because of inflation and rising costs
with black friday the cpu 7600x 7700x still 50 overprice the am5 motherboard still 100 overprice 125 for the am5 motherboard May be need to wait until 2025 for that price
DS3H 160 Damn Thats robbery
New CPUs are well performing AMD could have gained good market share if they had released budget boards like A620 and Budget B650 In India cheapest B650 is 200 Thats cheap asrock board For reference decent B450 goes for 85 not cheapest Usually people prefer to dump more money on CPU and GPU then going for mid range to decent motherboards You can up your 7600x to 7700x if you save those on motherboard Some people in comment section are giving excuses like inflation recession gen5 ddr5 Pls read this Inflation is not 200 Gen 5 doesn't cost this much Don't post like only you can do research on Internet AM5 motherboards are comparatively expensive Accept it and move on
Motherboards starting at 125 x200B Suggested MSRP

AMD says AM5 socket will be supported for long but we know later chipsets won't be eager to support all the CPUs as seen in X570 B550 lacking official supports of Zen Zen This is a kind of a rhetoric if not a fraud and can be a concern for Zen4 X3D users
They keep adding useless features that we don t need making the boards more expensive Excessive RGB Overbuilt VRMs 2 5g NIC USB C header Useless 5 1 SPDIF audio solution Overclocking enthusiast features Another 8 pin EPS connector for no reason Metal shrouds and shields purely for aesthetic
Right I planned on getting a 7700X but settled for a 12600k instead since the mobo situation was pissing me off Couldn't even find all that I wanted in 320 mobo let alone sub 200 What a joke Like really can't have 5 audio jacks for that price when I can get a snap on i o shield 80 dollar mobo that has them
AMD has gone full intel
Remember when 70 was a top notch mid end board price
Bought 7700x soon after launch and its already 100 off smiling face with tear thanks amd
Well my Phenom II X4 975 Black served me well for 10 years on a 990 board Looks like my 3900X on a X570 will have to last me until about 2029 Gotta make my upgrades worth while
2025 that's it
I don't get it if you use your computer for work then go am5 platform costs are justified with better productivity If you are enthusiast and cutting edge is your hobby then price doesn't matter as well But there is no reason to go am5 for games you get maybe minimal fps loss with cpu like 5800x3D Better invest that am5 money to buy better gpu Move to am5 when its mature and cheap or when you really need it for big fps gains
You have to wait for A620
The future hello and or duh
I was sold on going with AMD for a small form factor build 7600X now and 3D update in 1 2 years But good ITX boards are really hard to find the ASUS B650E I has not been in stock Instead I went with 13700k and MSI z790 i board as both are available now and the hope it will last me a whole next
I was on the market for an upgrade to my 9700k since it was giving me headaches in cyberpunk in the center of night city erratic frametimes low framerates and my 3080 being bottlenecked not only by this game I went ahead with the intention of jumping on the 7000 Zen4 bandwagon only to find that the equivalent to the mobo I have on Intel Aorus Pro Z390 costs like twice on it's x670 version by buying a mobo for that price I could buy a 5700x and an Aorus Elite x570 on black Friday and that's exactly what I did Really the pricing for a decent mobo is ridiculous for x670
Given how upset people got when they wouldn t support motherboards for 5 generations of product I suspect they re trying to amortise the longer support lifespan upfront This is slight sarcasm they probably think you re less likely to upgrade the board so they d rather get more upfront
That's one of the main reasons I didn't upgrade to AM5 I had a 2600X and was due for an upgrade and was planning on springing for AM5 but the mobo prices combined with insane DDR5 prices was too much for me and I ended up going for a 5900X
The prices of MOBO's are insane for AMD In some extreme cases for 350 you do not even get a good amount of USB and a better audio chip than the obsolete ALC 897 Considering 350 is a lot of money for a MOBO things are looking grim for AM5 platform
Is 2025 support supposed to be a selling point That's in 2
The 2025 claim isn't as impressive as it seems The AM5 boards won't really start saturating the market until mid 2023 so that only leaves most people with two years or one Ryzen generation of upgrade Maybe the will do some heavy lifting but I doubt it PCIe 6 0 has already been defined and is in testing If you have a late AM4 chip I may suggest skipping AM5 all together
All this tech is a joke there is almost no difference between 5k series on up that makes the processors more costly It is simply the corporations way of justifying making more money for a 3 7 improvement while forcing one to buy an entire new system
Better yet buy a nice AM4 setup with a 5800X3D and it'll last you well beyond 2025 and cost less Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
'Starting at' means just the shitty ones Keep scrolling 'till you get to the ones that still use the green pcb and the capacitors that just kind of fall off when you brush against them
New platforms are often expensive in the beginning Sit tight little boys
Here come the know it alls claiming 5yrs of support on their motherboard when it claims socket support and we saw the same issue with AM4 but sure
I swear I thought there was a slide out there claiming 125 by the end of the year But either my memory is faulty or it got deleted off the internet
This is probably targetted toward AIB partners lmao and somebody by mistake leaked to consumers
Should you even buy any of the original launch chipsets X370 B350 and A320 didn t even get official required support for Zen 2 or Zen 3 it was up to the motherboard manufacturers to add it or not To me the most important part of keeping socket support for years is making sure that all motherboards also support the new CPUs Otherwise you re buying a new CPU and new motherboard together anyway who gives a shit weather the old processor wouldn t physically fit into it or not
I think the better question is when
What is the problem 160 is 125 190 is 125
Laughing in AM4 owner not clear what AM5 gets you other than much higher prices for everything for rather marginal gains
I remember the gold old days when you could get entry level motherboards for 60
2025 AMD don't even We both know your not gonna fuck it as long as you did AM4 So don't lie to me alright Just drop the sign and we'll call it 2025 you fat bastards
Where In your dreams of
Mainboards get less and less complex while the prices are rising
It just says am5 not am5 on day 1 Just wait This sort of half clocked argumentation is asinine
We're definitely getting there Cheapest B650s were over 200 at launch A620 isn't out yet
125 at 2025 i belive
I remember for 125 you could get cheaper Z chipset mobos now it's minimum price lol
That was AMD's assumed MSRP Until the day comes when AMD starts printing motherboards don't take such claims seriously
They said similar things about AM4
Looks like AIBs are compensating the lack of sales during AM4 era
A620
Nowhere EU prices are twice that
So what they're saying the only value of you Chuck out your CPU every year and get a new one I stay on a single CPU generation until it no longer does the task I need of it so this marketing is just telling me not to bother I would be better if with Intel getting all of the features I want immediately and not caring about upgrade paths because by the time I update AMD's platform would be dead too
Failed at first bullet point
Companies that sell the motherboard also needs to make profit and thus the price keeps increasing
in 2 years when new boards are out they never said when those 125 boards were coming
I ll upgrade when the CPU supports DDR5 6000 Seems like 7000 series is lacking memory bandwidth
yeah when these cpus are just matginally better than a 300 last gen chip and you have to go out and replace the motherboard and ram and cooler as well its a tough sell 7xxxX3d is the soonest ill buy in for the types of games I play the only chip worth buying is 5800x3d because UE4 is so cache hungry
2025 makes sense We won t see a 9900x 9950x until 2 years from now in 2024 And 2025 the 3DV cache version of it Wish it was more than two generations
also Support is Planned not guaranteed
The keyword is from because 125US AsRock can either decent or straight up garbage The latter has been a bit more frequent
im just waiting to upgrade from my 2700x and ab350 board once ryzen 8000 releases or better yet until they fix the thick IHS and high thermal temps which im hoping will be the 8000 series
I wonder how the guy who wrote that slide is doing
Grow to pci gen 5 How
2025
Got a x570 thinking i would use to upgrade cpu later but now am4 is old news
Only exists on a slide deck and in the imaginations of the marketing dept
I bought my Aorus Pro Wifi Mini itx b450 for Looking at b450 550 boards now and prices are too high
Maybe in 12 months
Good news for gaming that the majority will be more than happy using a 5800x3D until 2025 plenty of time to see Intel's new platform and price drops on AM
Gonna wait for a 3D series for 7000 tbh
Even so that's such a shitty price to start at
Does it grow with you tho My x370 board is capable of pcie 4 an ya artificially held it back you wouldn't have even given it 5000 series support untill we modded them and found out it was perfectly capable of running them ourselves and kicked up a huge stink are am5 first gen boards going to get the same treatment
Just bought the stupid asus X670e gaming for 500 usd I had to because I bought 7950x for 550 usd on sale I hate the new motherboard prices
I don't get the obsession with long term socket support Are ya'll upgrading your CPUs every year That can't be very cost effective Why not buy a high end CPU and just build a whole new rig every 4 5 years
They say start at 125 but they never say when it will be available Budget board are normally the last to be released
Yk 160 isn t that bad compared to 250
Just another US based move on
Chipset from 125 Put on the motherboard will have additional fee
My brother in Christ my mobo was 500 I could only wish for a price similar to that
RemindMe 1 year
Still waiting for a cheap A620 board
We're going back to 2017 I see
Me and the boys as early adopters of Zen still rocking Zen first gen APUs
TUF shit ASUS

Wait what Wasn t a starter board around 50 60 What happened
Waiting for a720 with the slide price
I am surprised to see sub 200 just looked the other day Any good budget MBs I currently consider the ASRock X670E PG Lightning
2025 is not so long
how long do you think it takes till they drop 2 months more
I'm actually waiting for bundle deals with the 7000 series and AM5 MOBA's Aiming january february or is that too naive Because right now the AM5 moba's are far too expensive If I would urgently need to build a game PC right now I'd go for intel with corresponding MOBA to save hundreds of 's
Chip shortage tax on new AM5 motherboards even tho there no shortage
In AliExpress duh
I'm expecting more entry level options to launch in Jan Alongside the non X CPU variants launching 10th of Jan
Typical launch glitch Expect supply and demand to fix this problem as these boards shit on the shelves in wait
I was always getting downvoted for asking this question whenever there's a discount on cpu prices
Yeah I got the Asus ROG Strix B650E F for 320 euros during Black Friday Sweden incl tax In my head canon that was the actual non discount retail price
I m running a b650 a with my 4090 It only was 270 from new egg woman shrugging Not all the am5 mobos are expensive
Mobo makers saw people with ab350 rocking last gen am4 I would have paid bit more to have better longevity support with latest tech available for mysterious gods of future proofing
Is there any other reason that is justified from the production cost point of view or something else technical actually like do all those new fancy technologies and features actually still cost a lot maybe like the analogy with RAM prices just after in enters market vs years after that Just curious from the technical point of view and asking because purely curious here I knew the X570 was annoying though not this much but I was not really witnessing during X370 release new AM4 platform just like now the AM5
Is that really even a secret Also the A series boards will be the cheapest ones none of those are even listed or released yet They're also very stripped down and hobbyists wouldn't want them
i paid launch price for my B350 and Ryzen 1600 i can confirm it was more than what it later leveled out to be but the board was 90 bucks and that price point is just dead these days
Not really relevant here The question is where AMD is claiming there are 125 boards not whether mobo manufactures price poorly
Yea I don't get why it is surprising that there is a premium to pay to be on the bleeding edge of technology
Ah wonderful seems like i chose a great time to uprade my CPU and Mobo
The dsh3 was 200 The same card for 160 is still highway robbery I used to get them for under 50 That's a 200 mark up
Yeah it was cheaper to get an x570 board for a little bit
I don't recall this with B550 I bought my Strix B550 F on launch day for 189 Same board today 2 5 years later is 169
I'm sure the Bx50 mid tier boards will also come down in price once AM5 adoption actually takes off Right now there is the whole issue of new tooling major design changes lower volume and all the other issues you see with major generation shifts The major change to the socket and chipsets mean that motherboard makers had to design totally new PCB trace designs couldn't copy paste from previous generations AM4 motherboards and chipsets being long lived offered real manufacturing advantages to motherboard makers even though they had to put more effort into software by pushing updates for whatever the newest AM4 based CPU was Each generation of AM4 motherboard involved only really needing to tweak the PCB designs and in some cases it looked like they literally reused the previous generations design entirely with only the chipset updated
So cheap boards with almost no features Great
In the distant past AMD did make one LGA chip and I'm struggling to remember what it was
That's what I was thinking Those are B class mobos And decently priced considering the tech
I just hope those will get the same next gen CPU support I'm a bit worried they'll restrict it to like B650E and X670E only at some point after 2024
Thanks Obama
In comparison it costs amd exactly 69 to produce a 7950x in December 2022 The rest is obviously overpriced and overrated R D
Europe usually has 20 tax included on the price Cheapest am5 board in the states is 150 20 180
Yeah I got a Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX for 199 90 and even that was a BF offer
Cheapest in Norway is 250 and cheapest full atx in stock is 300
what would the reason for upgrading be your tech is still fairly new
x670 owners
And I bought a dsh3 for 45 in 2019
It costs AMD exactly 69 to produce a 7950x Stop justifying big shitty corps
Depends on the features If it has features you used to only get on X570 boards it might be a good deal A620 boards will be even cheaper but B650 is for mid level boards The cheapest board in AMDs lineup right now is 60 It's an AM4 motherboard they said they consider AM4 as complimentary to AM5 instead of a replacement and will continue to support it You can literally put one of the fastest CPUs for gaming 5800X3D on that 60 board and get good performance from it Considering you'll get 3 5 years of CPU support with AM5 I think it's worth paying a little extra for considering you're also getting features you used to only get on mid level X570 boards
Agree a B650 not to be mistaken with B650E funny they even have to have 2 variants with no PCIe 5 0 lanes should not be starting at 150 An A620 board starting at 125 is a joke if that s what they meant Literally mobo is 50 the cost of the rumored low price of 229 for a 7600 7600X and a B650 and you re generally looking around 200 so 66 the price of the 7600X I don t give a flying fuck about VRMs being top tier that s what the top tier and now they even have the B650E it s so bad costs a 50 premium for a glorified B550 board with DDR5 and LGA
Am5 boards are also generally better for the price if you look at the actual quality of the boards especially the vrms 150usd b650M boards from ASRock with 12 2 1 power phases
AMD has said nothing about chipset compatibility this go around and they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to it almost every time on AM4 Where are you getting the idea that you will be able to upgrade your 2022 motherboard with a 2027 CPU
Yeah right now the other option buying new is lga1700 and it's already end of support since 14th gen intel will be a new socket So you can spend 30 less on a motherboard and not be able to upgrade your cpu
a 3 5 year platform support vs 1 2 AMD's claim of support is vacuous as they have not defined at all what that actually means
Funny how you're bringing up Nvidia where it isn't relevant as a way to draw attention away from a bad AMD value
Lmao ddr4 But yeah the ASRock boards all have way over built vrms on them for the price Best value by far No issues with bios for a while now as well had some sleep issues that got fixed a month or two ago I personally got an x670e steel legend for 250 I was originally just going to grab an msi board before I saw how much better value ASRock's were I was so happy I bought the tier up In that time window their x670e boards were cheaper than the regular x670 boards and the couple of b650 boards that were out
Asrock has basically been the one non stupid company so far with boards their b650e starts from 230 or something as well
Maybe I'm just stuck in an old mindset but I've always just considered the CPU Motherboard to be a pair In 5 years when I'm ready to upgrade CPU I'd never want to just throw it into my current motherbaord I want the new features a new board can offer too So to me even if that 3 5 year support timespan works out it doesn't really matter to me
New boards not supporting old CPU's doesn't seems like too big of a concern though
The VRMs from previous generation were inadequate so now they are over manufactured to run any chip from the stack I think a lot of you forget these chips are HEDT solutions They run circles around the servers from a decade ago but are compressed into significantly less surface area Also they are designed for much more erratic voltage Core controls are much more sophisticated I do like having the extra network connection the high end audio it makes a huge difference with desk speakers overclocking features and the extra 8pin is for LN mostly Not everybody wants them but a good majority of people building a pc themselves would be upset if some aspect of it was outdated or performed poorly down the line Then that reflects on AMD as building PCs becomes more accessible people stop conflating motherboard issues with motherboard manufactures they say AMD produced a broken system To be frank these people are morons But they changed the landscape of the DIY market because we are now being flooded with them Imagine finding out that the biggest issue with a brand new 2000 GPU is people couldn't plug them in right The average PC builder is significantly less technologically educated to troubleshoot their system than 10 years ago when working with computers still felt niche Now anyone can do it with the help of a youtube tutorial Consumers are getting dumber so manufactures are either reducing segmentation or artificially segmenting their product stack with just increased server workstation capabilities rather than feature sets up the stack because consumers couldn't even be bothered to learn which chipset was compatible with their motherboard before purchasing it and then blaming AMD also board partners screwed up by sending out mislabeled BIOS on boards so people were popping Zen2 CPUs into unflashed boards that needed to be sent back and AMD had to send out flash kits with low end CPUs that were compatible to complete the change It was cheaper for them to just include all of the features and make any chip compatible than to have to pay for RMAs marketing slides and videos wasting peoples time to explain very basic aspects of computers and SoCs The mining craze plus this hobby having been ridiculously accessible to get into led to this Get used to this happening every time something gets popular
mix that with ps2 ports low number of usb ports and most of them 2 0 ancient audio chips
Precisely
Many people in the market that want to build a new PC will think like this The market right now is funneling people towards the blue camp
Early adopter tax
10years Woa That's amazing
and only socket support no mention of chipset support
They promised support for AM4 through 2020 Zen 1 launched in 2017 5800X3D launched this year I wouldn t be surprised if AM5 sees similar life Zen4 Zen4 V cache Zen5 Zen5 V cache Zen6 Seems like a decent product stack for the platform
Am4 also lasted longer than expected so I would say 2027 is more likely
It will probably depend on when ddr6 comes out
There are motherboard manufacturers that have said they have boards coming for 125 for B650
Hey it's in stock on the ASUS site right now assuming you're in the US I knew I read someone asking for it recently I just spammed 3 other people not realizing they asked 1 month ago oh my god and I got so excited I never read the end of your message saying you got a z790 board WHELP
You've misunderstood what they said They said at least until 2025 They've said they're aiming for 5 years but can only guarantee it for 3 years for obvious reasons With AM4 they promised support until 2020
Hope EU legislation could spice things up a bit in the whole world
He already sorted to price ascending
Even 'shitty' AM4 boards ran the 5950x without performance degradation though The same can not be said about intel and a 12900k or 13900k
Boots still take like 5 10 seconds but the sleep issues have been fixed now I've never heard of a video card not working or anything about 2nd monitor issues unless you aren't talking about the motherboards anymore
The issue with early AM4 boards was with a limited memory capacity of the BIOS They fixed that and it's not going to be an issue on AM5 boards This sub has been overrun with overly negative and misinformed posts and comments about AMD lately wth is going on
There have been reports from motherboard manufacturers that they're going to release 125 motherboards soon
No it was said by AMD in their presentation of the Ryzen 7000 series
and an AM4 CPU is still topping the charts in gaming beating the new expensive AM5 CPU's
You still can There are several AMD boards for 60 on Newegg Remember AMD considers AM4 their low end platform now
There's nothing to indicate that they would reduce platform longevity though AM4 promised till 2020 yet it delivered the 5800X3D in 2022
Wth Did you mean the opposite of what you wrote AM5 motherboards are packed with new and more advanced features Even the currently cheapest board for 150 has features like 12 2 1 Power Phase VRMs 2 5 Gb Ethernet HDMI 2 1 USB3 2 Gen2 Type c 7 1 channel audio
I'll release some new toilet paper and sell it at the local grocery store I'll say it costs 10 cents a roll In reality I price it at 100 a sheet for 50 years straight angering customers Then 51 years since release I finally set the price down to what I originally promised Definitely no sketchy stuff It's 10 cents a roll what's the problem at all
As others have pointed out the cheapest AM5 motherboards out right now are really overbuilt for the extreme low end of the market With oversized VRMS and features that used to belong on X570 mobos Even the cheapest one available currently has 2 5Gb Ethernet HDMI 2 1 USB3 2 Gen2 Type c and 7 1 Nahimic Audio whatever that is
Yes and that's the case so I wanna know WHATTAFAKKA Who is buying this shitsss Everybody I know is strugglign with the energy costs my mom is complaining how expensive her new shoes were And Then we are buying 200 euro mother boards WHO XD
I got a 7700X and B650 but only because I was running Intel Kaby Lake If I was on AM4 I would have gotten the 5800X3D
I got a 7700X hoping to be able to upgrade to Zen 5 6 X3D
What about them make them garbage
I guess the pci gen 4 slots just metamorph into gen 5
Only if you already have a 5800X3D That is still one of the fastest CPUs you can get for gaming these days

If they decide to release a 7600X3D then maybe
only
I wanted to build a new PC with a B650 and a R5 7600X with 16GB normal DDR5 RAM and then upgrade in the future But thanks to your comment I saw that my X370 board now supports the R7 5800X3D From 1600 to 3600 to 5800X3D those are 3 generations for me with meaningful performance upgrades each time That is awesome
Same I'm actually hard considering switching from 5600x into 5800x3D yes the gains will be minimal from a 5600x but 8c 16t will be future proof enough with the excellent gaming performance and probably streaming performance I probably won't lag as much compared to streaming with a 5600x I mostly play competitive esports titles overwatch 2 and some occasional single player AAA games I recently just tried New World too with FPS of about 80 160 So 5800x3D is actually quite attractive as I would probably gain more FPS with lower FPS dips for overwatch 2 Thank god my asrock b450m steel legend supports 5800x3D still looking for a good deal not from US D
It's a perfect storm of multiple factors DDR5 is somewhat more difficult to route than DDR4 especially now that 4 is a proven widely used tech This means the boards might have to have extra layers more development time etc There are definitely higher r d costs for this gen BOM prices have gone up significantly both due to availability and because economy of scale is depressed somewhat due to everyone from discrete component manufacturers to OEM don't want to be left sitting on a huge stock of components when the economy crashes Which leads to manufacturers components and integrated products padding their margins in preparation for expected severe cost cutting drop in sales in the near future Also margins on the last couple gens of AM4 motherboards were razor thin partially because of the extreme backwards and forwards compatibility of the platform Prices had to be extremely attractive to sell any I'd be surprised if the big boys ever let that happen again They are going to price in potential future lost revenue from skipped upgrades I'm probably wrong about how much these factors are at play but I'm sure they all have some impact
My hypothesis is that mobo manufacturers are putting more margin on their boards because of the promise of long AM5 support They were basically forced to update old AM4 boards right from back at launch to run 5000 series CPU's They probably never anticipated that when Ryzen 1000 launched So now they are upfronting the money instead of trying to chase upgrades
They probably just charge more because you won t need to buy another one if you want to upgrade your cpu in a couple of years So since they can t sell you two of them they sell you a more expensive one to make up for it
R D retooling higher failure rates both after sales and during QC and lower sales volume
They have advanced knowledge of partner price points for reasons like this This is probably for the A series as others have suggested They are starting that the board available will start at 125 they didn't say they were available for purchase
400 euros doesnt even get you a decent number of usb ports or a half decent audio chip on some of these boards no thanks
That was the first board I noticed too The DSH3 is historically one of the lowest end cheapest options 160 for that board is incredibly overpriced
ds3h
under 50 was a sale or second hand new they were 80 x200B and look at the hardware on it old ds3h aint look like that its even got a 6 layer PCB with their 2x cpu and memory layers its 160 usd now btw
I got an X570 and R5 5600 to upgrade my r5 2600 ans b450 The x570 board was cheaper than the b550 boards I looked at on friday Was a great day
I got an x570s aorus master for 220 that is cheaper than most b650 boards despite the master being one of the best am4 boards period
IDK relay buldzoid has talked about it a bit DDR5 and PCIE 5 add a lot to cost AM4 had the advantage of a much cheaper requirements It's in part why intel still has DDR4 options it's not just the cost of RAM The PCB of the mobo has to be higher quality with DDR5 OEM's want some cheaper options Think of how dell needs to kick out PC's by the truck load 10 saved a PCB scaled up is a lot
It's the double hit of DDR 5 and PCIE 5 just adds to cost We also have hit an odd time of inflation when prices of everything is going up to add to the pain suspect a lot of us will be making are PC's last a tad longer than normal I know I wont jump to a new system for a long time Also AMD has been clear AM4 is going to be the low end option for a long time They have just mentioned it in interviews
You'd think billion dollar companies could take a small hit to spur that
Who would've though that cheap gets you cheap Bruhs here wanting to buy Ferraris with 3 and used toilet paper
I think that's socket TR4 for some of AMD's Threadripper CPUs Those were geared for workstations not mainstream consumers
Socket F which was LGA F
OEM's need something cheep for a mobo it will come I am sure Dell has got there mobo's down way under that price already
As long as OEM's need a cheep option there will be support joys of life Look at A320 came out in 2016 Looked at scan to find one 58 and supports the 5950X Suspect you may not get max speed VRM may get tad warm lol cpu OEM's just need cheep mobo's they may not bee good and support may be slow but if it sells it will get updates
Just because my motherboard is new dosent mean the cpu in it is
Nice
I seriously doubt that it costs only 69 to produce a 7950x But even if so AMD needs substantially more than that just to stay in the fight to provide competition to Intel and NVidia AMD has come a long way since its near bankrupt condition in 2015 but they still have a tough road going forward
AMD is pretty open about their margins which are just over 40
Depends on the features Depends on nothing A mainstream non HEDT platform that will need eventual budget CPUs to survive with a BASE price of 125 for a motherboard is absolutely insane and ridiculous 60 on AM4 boards was borderline acceptable for the absolute lowest tier similar Intels could be found for 45 125 is straight up fucking delusional for a BOTTOM OF THE BARREL board
I agree People do not mention this enough The boards are ridiculously overkill overbuilt
That's probably true I'd think they're built for longevity and durability and with support for futures CPUs in mind which ends up costing a little more up front but ends up saving the user money in the long run
Better Most dont even have basic stuff that all the generation before it had Most are missing cmos reset an 7segment display less pci lanes buggy bios wierd boot time problems But hey most of them got wifi now I really wonder where the money was spend on these board if basic stuff vanished XD
The main issue with chipset compatibility was the limitation to the BIOS capacity that was rather limited on the earliest boards They fixed it though and the new BIOSes have a larger capacity to ensure compatibility with future CPUs With AM4 they promised support until 2020 but ended up supporting it longer With AM5 they're promising support until 2025 but are aiming for 5 years so until 2027 They just can't guarantee it that far ahead
In the context they use it it's meant to be new CPUs coming out They used to say they were going to support AM4 until 2020 but they ended up making new CPUs until 2022 and there are rumors they're going to release a new X3D CPU for AM4 and a few lower end CPUs
I'm making the point that we should have some perspective To look at it in a broader view Everything is getting more expensive these days inflation is a thing And a greedy company like Nvidia is adding their greediness tax on top of the already bad inflation and are adding 500 to their 80 class video card and here we are some of us are complaining about 30
It s not DDR4 that s an error with the Newegg write up
And agree they are the only ones who haven t gone batshit crazy with pricing I think the x670e Steel Legend is the best overall value board for AM5 by far It s still expensive at 299 but if that were to come down to 249 over the next 6 months and we see more b650 in the 149 199 range things will improve big time To be fair Gigabyte has a decent looking b650 at 189 rn as well
Woahhh where'd you get a 250 X670E I built an AM5 rig about a week ago and I only managed to snag a B650E Steel Legend for 240 open box luckily I haven't had any problems with the mobo aside from a few hiccups on the first boot cuz I bolted on the cooler too hard despite one suspicious looking pin in the socket
Different products for different peple If your upgrade cycle is 4 years or higher then the longevity doesn't really matter But if it's 3 years or lower saving 150 on a new motherboard can be a huge cost saver
A pair and a pair that at least for me I don't see myself upgrading unless something goes wrong I just got a 6700xt this pass weekend The processor I'm running is a 3600 and I don't see myself upgrading that for I dont even know how long
This is a fantastically detailed reply I upvote you for putting in the time Your username should be TheGreatComputerGuy
It's a sad mix sad but relieved face
Anecdotally I upgraded my PC with a zen3 CPU on my existing x370 so the longevity on AM4 was really valuable Biggest downside now is no pcie 4 0 but it's a feature I never really needed and was nice not to need to pay for I think AMD may have shot themselves in the foot by offering pcie 5 0 in these first rounds of 6xx chipsets but I can see where they're coming from to keep forward feature compatability more complete
Not many people know this but AM4 actually started before Zen 1 The first CPUs available for AM4 were Excavator CPUs of the Bristol Ridge variety so Athlon X4s A6 A8 A10 A you could literrally go from an Athlon X4 from 2016 to a 5800X3D on an A320 motherboard in 2022
Am4 only lasted this long because of consumer outcry AMD was very publicly intending to end support for it a lot sooner
Agh I ve been watching that site since launch for availability too late now Con I just bought into a non upgradeable platform pro it s a well optimized and adopted platform that could see me through to am6 anyway
Maybe the will do some heavy lifting but I doubt it Using AM4 as the rationale for what will happen to AM5 is ridiculous
indeed there are no green pcb AM5 boards anyways
5950x without performance degradation Wow Such misinformation is upvoted here
't spread misinformation
Boot times on my X670E Hero with 7900X are about 5 seconds to bios and then 3 seconds to Windows login screen The first boot takes like 5 minutes when it s memory training but once it s locked in it s just as fast as any other platform
No the issue was they never promised chipset support they promised socket support and they never intended to update them clearly What s misinformed is saying socket support chipset support Not only because they re not the same thing but because that mistake was made on AM4 and it was clear it was a mistaken assumption
Who On Twitter Or just online Leakers It would make sense since the starting boards look a little overbuilt
That was the mistake I was taking about
They must be b450s Last time I checked Amazon for a simple board to build a server just need SATA Network and some USB ports I couldn't find anything less than 100 and even those were refurbed
2 5gb ethernet is a 1 3 Euro cost point 7 1 is even cheaper usb controllers what My 5 year old mainboard has 10gbit usb and was 120 euro when I bought it At this point mainboards are basically the chipset and some basic power and usb controllers Nothing mainboards 10 15 years ago didn't have Just look at old mainboards and all the chips they used to have Southbridge Nvidia nvlink that often required additional cooling which added even more cost
if they want extreme low 't extreme low end they would have to wait around the time 7100 7300 comes low end but still extreme low end would be AM4 with a 4100 4500
200 is very normal price for motherboard but not for an entry level one That's the problem
Got a 3950x u think it s a worthy upgrade Or better to upgrade for the next couple years Gpu will be 4090 Going for an ITX build lol
Compared to my other choices 270 was amazing dude lol It was literally that one for 270 or 500 I opt I opted for the 270
That s nice to hear check your mobo BIOS update to see if your mobo can support 3600mhz RAM and throw in a second hand RAM If you feel spendy
And AMD knows all of this and publicly state the minimum price It's still responsibility for promising a price point that doesn't exist
To be fair the first DDR4 wasn't great like the first DDR3 wasn't great like the first DDR2 wasn't
Yea just wait till the price drops It's supply and demand Our complaints have limited impact Best to spend our energy on more profitable endeavors
there's no such thing as 'decent motherboard audio chip'
Let me put it this way If amd did a zen3 refresh an n6 and stuck 3d cache across the entire lineup it would be a better buy than this shit We are at a point where there is no incentive to buy an amd product A good incentive would be to move the entire product stack down a notch The 7600x is now an 8 core and the 7500 a 4core for 100usd 6 cores right now are the worst deal around Costs like an 8core and it's too much for office tasks Eliminating the 6core tier would be best for all R3 4 r5 8 r5 12 r7 16
This gen ds3h is much much better and has all the features 99 of users need Riptide m is a few bucks more and has gen5 m2 on top of that
Well apparently they were permanently on sale
It'll get better with time but early release is always rough This isn't a surprise since I remember the shift to ddr3 and ddr4 was pricy compared to predecessors right away It's still relatively new
B550 started at like 99 no I'm sure it adds 10 20 in parts but a 60 higher starting price seems wrong If it was that much more they should have announced 159
why are am4 ddr4 boards more expensive too then
Cheapest intel board with PCIe 5 0 x16 DDR5 is 132 ASUS H610M C CSM A rather low end board A tuf B660 can be had for 206 with also pcie 5 0 x16 and ddr5 Cheapest AMD motherboard with this would be the Asrock B650E PG riptide at 274 Most 200 ish AM5 boards only offer pcie4 0 x16 in this case a DS3H for 193 Oof
Cheap used to be 50 Now it's almost triple
For 125 if expect more than what they are probably going to release at that price Just looking at the price of some 650 boards Lees features compared to cheaper 570 boards
Bruhs here wanting to buy Ferraris with 3 and used toilet paper i certainly wouldn't
Well yes of course But I mean in the 90s I could have sworn I remembered AMD making an LGA chip I know Sun did too Somehow Intel gets credit for the idea

Thank you
Why is your motherboard newer than your cpu Honest question
Man when you have a x570 your cpu must be a ryzen 3000 that's quite new
I have a x370 r7 1800x rtx 3060 My rig runs better than a ps5 so I'm content My roommate who owns a ps5 is jealous at my gaming setup graphically speaking Once I had that real world validation I had ZERO urge to upgrade anymore Next upgrade will be when this am4 mobo or cpu takes a dump on me I built my rig originally in 2018 the only part to go bad was the AIO cooler I had a r5 1600x b350f rx580 8gb originally A reasonably priced 4k 120hrtz monitor is the next goal when the price comes down
Oh you wouldn't believe it There's no good guys Lisa Su is even related w Nvidia ceo lmao
I think you're missing the point AM5 is their high end and mid range platform what you seem to want is their low end platform AM4 Besides the currently cheapest AM5 mobo is 150 but it's not exactly a low end board it's packed with specs and features that used to go on mid range X570 boards and up To make a cheaper version of that board they can drop the feature list down to 1Gb Ethernet instead of 2 5 if you use Wifi anyway they could give us normal on board audio and HDMI 1 4 instead of 2 1 Who cares about 2 1 on the motherboard if you're going to use a GPU anyway But low end support will come next year with A620 Seems like you're in the market for that instead of their high end and mid range boards
I went with an x670e board just because I figured memory overclocking would be better in the future but I'm confident I would have been fine to drop in a flagship zen 6 cpu with just a b650 board some of the gigabyte ones are kind of cheap though
The CMOS reset was something I was annoyed with but 7 segment displays are kind of useless with ryzen anyway Bios isn't buggy and boot times are normal after first boot which doesn't take that long anymore either Personally I care the most about VRMs and memory headroom as that is what determines how future proofed it is The PCB counts for these boards are encouraging as well Also most people aren't going to need more than the three pcie slots and 2 m 2 slots most b650 boards have
That limitation could be easily circumvented by releasing different BIOS images for different generations was only a problem for some boards and could have been avoided if AMD wanted to give their initial launch promise more than lip service They have also significantly changed the language around AM5 but they hoodwinked a lot of people including yourself which is obvious to me by your now deleted comment AMD is a multinational corporation that likes money and with the last two generations of CPU's have been moving to a high margin strategy just like Intel used to have Simping for them gets you nothing and I promise you being critical of them when they deserve it will not hurt their feelings
AMD is greedy too If you can't see a company for what it is you're objectively a fan
That's why I was laughing Newegg is just so freaking lazy they are the only site that big with so many problems
they are the only ones who haven t gone batshit crazy with pricing Every time I mention this I'm called a conspiracy theorist but it's dead obvious it's because they're the only non Nvidia partner and don't have to make up for the huge losses on 3000 series elsewhere Also Pegatron have really good supplier deals because of bulk so they can get some componentry cheaper
The cheapest b650 I saw from gigabyte had a crappy vrm compared to the offerings from certain other brands at that price Still it would probably be enough for future gaming tier cpus which is what people are buying at that price point anyway There is a b650M from ASRock going for 150 rn with 12 2 1 power phases
There was a sale at a local store in Taiwan just moved here Unfortunately I also had to pay 600usd for my 7900x It was a mixed bag and I ended up spending the same amount I would have in the US I have a PCPartpicker build under fulvoussky that explains it further if you want to look
Yeah I m curious to see where AMD does with future chipsets I don t foresee DDR6 PCIe 6 0 on consumer chipsets till AM6 and would actually be surprised if X870 had PCIe 6 0 support Seems to me like 5 0 will be the standard for a long while much like 3 0 was
Yeah this is something I learned of a few months ago That s why I made mention of Zen 1 in 2017 specifically otherwise I would have said AM4 in 2016 Either way it only reinforces just how good AM4 was I suspect AM5 will likely be of similar value
AMD's intention was to end support in 2020 That's what they promised support for mainly because of the limited memory on the early motherboards that just didn't have the space to support more CPUs They found a fix though and went above and beyond what they promised We should pat them on the back for that instead of using it against them It's miles better than what Intel offers us AM5 doesn't have that limitation in the BIOS They promised support until at least 2025 but said they're aiming for 2027
It would be if that was the only evidence or indication It's not though
Funnily enough there was a bios update I think a month ago that said it fixed something with the 4090 Don't know what you mean by 2d monitor issues though
No the issue was they never promised chipset support they promised socket support and they never intended to update them clearly Exactly they promised support for AM4 until 2020 not chipset support but they did it anyway They went above and beyond what they promised And they're saying they will promise support for AM5 until 2025 but are aiming for 2027 The BIOS limitation is no longer an issue so chipset support is no longer an issue either You're confusing chipset limitation with BIOS limitation It wasn't the chipset as a whole that was the issue with support on AM4 it was the limited space on the BIOS on the earliest AM4 motherboards They found a fix though and AM5 motherboards don't have this limit Not sure why you're so intent on spreading misinformation about this
Yeah people keep getting mad at the b650 pricing without realizing they're built like z and x series boards from previous generations Hopefully a620 isn't too bad so some people will join me on am5 I'm so lonely
No the tech press reported about it last month
There are several entry level boards for AMD available for 60 different brands and chipsets
Enig AM4 is AMDs current low end they've said so themselves they consider AM4 as something that complements AM5 not a replacement Lisa Su said in a recent presentation that they're going to continue supporting AM4 in the future whatever that means A couple months ago there was a rumor of a new X3D CPU coming for AM4 and a few lower end CPU's I'd be very surprised to actually see that but that could be what they meant by continued support AM4 has a huge installed user base it would be ludicrous not to take advantage of that
The boards out right now aren t 125 They re closer to 200 and above The cheapest board currently is 150 The next cheapest is 155 They've announced a few 125 boards coming soon Even the cheapest currently available board is over built though It has 12 2 1 Power Phase VRMs 2 5 Gb Ethernet HDMI 2 1 USB3 2 Gen2 Type c 7 1 channel audio 125 boards will surely have fewer features but they're going to be fine if you don't need those features like do you really need HDMI 2 1 if you're going to use a GPU anyway are you going to use Wifi so it doesn't matter much that it only has 1Gb Ethernet People shouldn't avoid those They're going to be fine even with future CPUs If you're into extreme overclocking you're obviously going to want something beefier but we already knew that
Why should people avoid those
I think it's definitely worth it to upgrade to a 5800X3D if you're gaming with it Otherwise not I'm using a 3900X myself and I'm going to upgrade to a 5800X3D you not only get the snappier system performance of Zen 3 you get that amazing Vcache that helps in most games but especially in games that require a lot of computational power like MS Flight Sim 2020 Asetto Corsa WoW Factorio if that means anything to you
It depends on the use case but it can be a decent upgrade notably in 1 lows Is it an upgrade worth 330 though Sort of up to the user to decide
Depending on your applications quite big But if you don t have a graphics card to take advantage of the x3D it doesn t pay off Alao if you are after productivity performance look for 5950 for example as an upgrade
huge my 7700x is basically a 5800x3d in terms of gaming and sure enough going from 3950x to 7700x has been night day fps in pretty much every game has at least doubled some games tripled like valorant
For me it s a huge upgrade and gaming and the extra cores and stronger single core perf and freq helps in peoductivity
I'd buy one while they still make one Your current GPU won't see a big difference but if you popped in a current generation you certainly would Getting a 5800X3D will extend the life of your system a few years
whats your graphics card x200B if your 3600 is currently maxing it out then your average fps won't really increase but your frame pacing will be significantly better
I went from a 3700x to a 5800x3d and in some games I saw 50 FPS gains If you play simulators or other CPU heavy stuff it'll make a difference Go check benchmarks for what you play
I got about a 20 30 fps jump in most games going from a 3950x to 5800x3d Just make sure you have sufficient cooling as it runs much hotter than the 3000 series
I got about a 20 30 fps increase at 1440p over my 3950x Make sure you have sufficient cooling though as it runs much hotter than the 3000 series
Pretty significant in gaming workloads Really depends on what games you're typically playing but most of them should see significant improvements in fps and smoothness
I am already at 3600 CL16
OK I was responding to the question on if there was a justified reason prices were that high
Maybe that is what they think A620 can get to
oh shut up x200B stop acting like a goddamn victim
That exist existed somewhere There is no way AMD's lawyers would let them advertise that price point with out having something to back it up That is normal company tactic The chances are boards at that price point were minimal produced think like 1 10 Which would make the statement True There is also the possibility the boards were for a niche market that hardly anyone's heard of Then there is the question is that OEM Scummy yea do all companies do it of course I am not really shocked and no it doesn't make it morally right
true i also forgot the zero pci e x1 slots included and the slot added that your gpu will cover on the first day making it unusable
no reason at all to eliminate the 6 cores they are still very good but they could chuck em in with R3 and you forgot R9 which also exists
R3 should be 6 cores no reason to disable half of the CCD when yields are already good On another note anyone knows why there aren't 7 core CCDs
Delete 4 cores give 6 cores the 4 core price
Damn That board doesn't even have a single m 2 pcie5 slot I knew the x16 slot was optional but I thought that 1 m 2 being pcie5 was required It still looks to be build like a 130 last generation board but seems a little too much money
ddr5 right now is cheaper than ddr4 s few years ago price
This isn't a surprise since I remember the shift to ddr3 and ddr4 was pricy compared to predecessors right away yeah it happens every generation that's a major evolution instead of a refresh
B550 was also over a year late to market with only X570 as an option for ages
Well you may not have noticed we are hitting a big financial crash It's a mix of massive inflation and all the normal crash stuff Stonks or something The FTX fallout will be bad
How short memory is B550 was delayed so for a long time only X570 was an option There was no cheep B550 for a year was it over a year before B550 came out
Buy intel then
Yeah because inflation new socket a lot of money Plus this is the first time AMD went LGA You can't just repurpose old tools like you usually can PGA to PGA or LGA to LGA AMD is pushing CPU prices down as much as they can to sell some product and now it costs less to get 7950x running than it was to get 5950x at release
And a burger used to cost 10 Times change This is nonsense
What Motherboards were already 100 in literally 2001 The good ones were 140 People were already whining about the 100 price point in the 90s but I don't remember anyone claiming you used to be able to buy boards for 20 haha
Look at intel then intel and AMD have swapped places Today intel is the value option not AMD intel have DDR4 mobo's that are much cheaper and some relay good CPU's for lower costs AMD has moved to where intel was a few years back there charging more then intel for the same performance Or wait a year or two for prices to drop
Whoda thunk completely new technology on a new socket is more expensive than old technology on an old socket
Yeah 2016 boards with tech that was around for a few years literally the latest tech available Not accounting for inflation increasing costs of literally everything independently from inflation and everything elss
That far I don't think I can remember The reason that Intel gets most of the credit is because they were the first to adopt LGA sockets for consumer use as known as first to market There may have been other companies before Intel that utilized these sockets but they didn't put them in consumer facing products likely due to them being too expensive to manufacture back in the 1990s or 2000s
old motherboard went bad got a pretty good deal on a newer one very simple
its old enough for a PC that is used for work that a cpu upgrade especially to one with onboard graphics would be very valueable
I have a x370 r7 1800x rtx 3060 My rig runs better than a ps5 so I'm content That looks weaker than the PS5 in every way
What AM5 is directly replacing AM4 New AM4 boards will not be developed new AM4 CPUs are not and will not be developed and support is slowing but surely going to fade AM4 is not a low end platform it s the last gen platform AM4 is cheap as a byproduct of being old not because it is low end
what you seem to want is their low end platform AM4 I'm obviously less confused than you are
That limitation could be easily circumvented by releasing different BIOS images for different generations was only a problem for some boards and could have been avoided if AMD wanted to give their initial launch promise more than lip service The fix they ended up going with was exactly that The BIOSes on the affected motherboards ended up replacing CPU support with newer ones once you flashed your BIOS They even offered probably still do a service where you can borrow a CPU from them to flash your BIOS with They have also significantly changed the language around AM5 but they hoodwinked a lot of people including yourself which is obvious to me by your now deleted comment Now you're starting to get weird Hoodwinked What deleted comment AMD is a multinational corporation that likes money and with the last two generations of CPU's have been moving to a high margin strategy just like Intel used to have Of course they like making money Since when are we starting to hold that against a company Are you boycotting Nike because you've learned they like money And why is multinational becoming a bad thing Is nvidia evil because they're multinational Or are they evil because they keep doing evil things AMD has a high margin strategy Of course they do They have a high margin medium margin and a low margin strategy Remember AM4 isn't going anywhere they promised to keep supporting it in the future and stated very clearly they consider it their low end platform Cheapest AM4 motherboard is 55 and can be used with a 5800X3D It was a month ago that I first heard people say in other subs that r amd has been overrun by people being paid to talk trash about AMD I'm starting to realize they weren't as wrong as I thought they were the amount of overly negative comments based on wrong information is becoming overwhelming
it all comes down to reading tea leaves That's up to you do whatever pleases you But everyone else knows what they mean by support in this context
We saw the greed when AMD overtook Intel with Zen 3 and priced their 6 core at 300 when previously it was 200 They tried to pull it again with Zen 4 but had to cut prices If AMD manages to beat Nvidia they will do the same with gpus Even now AMD is no saint 7900XT is even more cut down from the flagship than the 6800XT was yet they want to charge 250 more for it Conveniently changed name to justify higher price just like Nvidia Only difference is that it isn't that overpriced
Yeah but there s so few players these days I still use them because at least they stock the stuff and at release Amazon hides the stuff on release and prices are very high Best Buy has very few skus for pc builders Microcenter is only helpful in store and no store nearby It s a pretty sad state of affairs tbh
Newegg sucks but at least specs are mostly right Component shopping on Amazon is terrible People make listings and throw in every buzzword in the header
True but I think the conspiracy is different I think Intel is bribing the board partners or incentivizing them to keep z790 boards cheaper than AM5 And I don t just mean ddr4 across the whole lineup the equivalent board is usually cheaper Why
Unless you have something to back that up you're gonna have a hard time proving these prices are rigged
Will definitely take a look I'm kinda interested
I d like to ask you how an objective fact we both agree on is misinformation Why because you don t like hearing it TL DR AM4 proved AMD s commitment to socket support does not specifically mean chipset support As we both agree AMD went out of their way to support older chipsets on newer CPU s This is all that needs to be said You start out right and then 180 and go against it Correct AMD went above and beyond It s critical to understand they wanted to avoid PR issues and were trying to gain market share at the time they no longer have to do that They could also now point at the fact they corrected this misunderstanding with AM4 and are unwilling to do it again Updating mobos also takes a combined effort of AMD AIBs there is no guarantee If they wanted to they d have that wording up as it d be a marketing advantage and more people would hop on the platform they did not It doesn t matter if motherboards have 64gb of flash on board Where did I even say a chipset limitation I clearly stated update meaning there wasn t a limitation but a lack of support But evidently you re putting words in my mouth misrepresenting me and picking at straws to form an argument Not supporting a chipset is not supporting a chipset lack of drivers bios hardware compatibilities or otherwise Optimistic or not seeing the reality and history of it isn t being negative Even if you want to claim it is negative fine I m not going to argue about that because it s a moot point and who cares That doesn t change an objective fact you can not safely claim that current AMD chipsets will be supported until 2025 They may they may not Edit to be clear doesn t matter what a company can do BMW could flip a switch and give free heated seats If they wanted to increase how competitive they were they could offer free trials or give it for free it s already there Intel may have software locks you can purchase to unlock CPU features in the future What s there and they may have added to have options down the road or what s technically possible what makes the most business sense at any given point
If they wanted to get really wild with it they could plausibly hang Zen4 chiplets off the AM4 DDR4 I O die There might be technical limitations in the way of that but since the chiplets don't talk to the socket ram directly they just talk to the I O die and everything speaks Infinity Fabric I'd imagine that such limitations would be voltage related either in the power used for the IF links or regulating power for a Zen4 or whathaveyou
Don't forget that an X370 board will likely have questionable power delivery compared to even a b450 or especially b550 5950x might be ok but I'd never run a 5900x That's not a typo 5900x often consumes more power because of the lower silicon quality At least my two 5900x' drew more power during cinebench than my two 5950x' all with pbo2 enabled
Gotta have the gpu to take advantage of it though His 5700xt is likely the bottle neck at this point
I got a slight 's build we wanna wait for AM5 x3d which is at least 3 mths out but we gotta settle for a mid range b650e board like b650e e strix and the x3d prices are unknown OR we can go 5800x3d now paired with a 225 high end board and reuse RAM If we use 7700x and hynix M die 32gb the cost diff vs 5800x3d build above is 325 i est at least 250 more for AM5 if theres even a
Niiicey then i still have my 2666mhz from my R7 1700 checking second hand offerings
For sure Just don't want folks to lose the sight that it's still on AMD
I'm not a victim I just won't buy overpriced motherboards I just prefer not to be lied to
what who cares you can put any pcie card in any damn slot use a riser or something its annoying but a totally solveable issue
Yea the pcie spacing has been an issue for so long that it should be solved by now
Eliminate r9 too I'm not saying 6 cores are bad I'm saying they are a terrible middle ground Too expensive for what they do and overkill for everthing else Customers would better served by either 4 and 8 cores
Probably they have to kill the cache
It is not required on regular b650 chipsets yeah
we did have a chip shortage for a while and ram and ssd prices skyrocketed
It's actually fairly reasonably priced Just seems expensive because DDR4 prices have become very affordable
my b450 is almost twice as expensive waaaay more than inflation
It's greed man Stop trying to parrot all the corporate justifications
Inflation is not 200 and new socket doesn't justify that kind of price increase either
Z370 asrock board with good amount features used to be less than 130 euros while an equivalent Z690 costs now atleast 250 euros motherboard manufacturers ripping off everyone call like what it is
Was a burger costing you that much 3 years ago
Burger used to cost 10 2 years ago
Cheap motherboards The bottom of the barrel A320s and B450s etc I didn't say 20 either I said 50
If you where not around for the DDR 3 to 4 jump to see costs go up then drop it's a shock to see prices go up then drop O I feel old I still have DDR ram some where
First AM4 boards were dirt cheap and the platform was new as well Components got more expensive but this is AIB trying to surf on the wave of super expensive hardware during the covid shortages
That's not how awarding credit goes
An in socket upgrade would probably serve you well then A 5800x3d for gaming or 5900 5950 for lots of threads Get em while they're available and cheap
that 1800x is a huge bottleneck x200B i recently upgraded to 5800x because i coudnt stand the 60fps cpu bottle necks and in older titles 100fps 5800x nearly doubled fps and that on a 2070 super
I'm talking about my room mate telling me as I'm playing Yo bro that looks better than my ps5 Which is the truth It's not always what's better on paper Him having screen tears and capped at 60fps While I'm buttery smooth at 120fps plus makes all the difference Plus the way the ps5 renders its graphics the pc version renders more textures from what I can see with the naked eye And the ps5 has a 2070 inside comparably speaking of it and runs on and hardwear so idk how much weaker my system would compare lmaoo Just my 0 02
The most graphic intensive game's like Dwarf Fortress only run on PC all PS5 users bow when they see my rig running DF at 4K Ah not long till DF comes out on steam the hype is real DF in action
Yeah well I just upgraded from a 1600 AF 12nm Zen refresh aka 2600 and XFX RX580 8Gb to a 5600 RX6600 8Gb That little 1600 6 core and the 580 absolutely outperform my PS5 in every metric Now my 5600 and 6600 leave it in the dust
The current line of motherboards and CPUs won't be disappearing suddenly if that's what you think The currently available products will be available for a while probably years AM4 has a huge installed user base It would be ludicrous of AMD to drop support for it and ignore the people still using it Look at how many 5800X3Ds they're selling right now people are upgrading their AM4 systems rather than replacing them Whether we'll see new motherboards and CPUs for it is questionable We don't really know there's a rumor going around that they're releasing a new X3D CPU and a few low end CPUs for AM4 but I guess we'll see at CES Lisa Su said in a recent presentation that they plan to support AM4 in the future this could be what she meant
No they don t you re the only one actually
Don't understand how any one buys shit especially gpus on Amazon Searching through computer components using their filters is garbage Everyone just throws in every buzzword when they list their product I'm having relics from 15 years ago show up when I look at Nvidia gpus Site is only good when you know exactly what you are looking for Best Buy just sucks My local ones just don't get stock of anything They haven't had cards above 6600xts or Nvidia gpus in a year
Yeah When I still lived in Florida microcenter just wasn't an option and bestbuys were practically useless Luckily I was good about holding onto my i7 8700 rx580 build and didn't need anything other than ram which I didn't have problems with
You obviously don't understand what happened with AiBs and AMD properly Maybe you should educate yourself on what actually happened instead of angrily arguing with someone for correctly stating the course of events This was not typically promised of CPU manufacturers in the past getting spoiled and complaining is just plain silly They did a great thing for a generation and now you're complaining they stated they would do it again Some of you have been on the internet too long you're weird
I would say in that case slightly depending on the tier of card you are going for go for the gpu first That would be the bigger jump A 3600 is not the fastest by any stretch but still a genuine gaming cpu Going for a 5800x3D would feel almost identical to your current setup as it is The gpu is more of the bottleneck
We have the exact same combo also planning to upgrade soon
N improving the CPU will help It will also make a difference with the 1 lows too I upgraded from the 5600X to the 5800X3D and everything feels way smoother I gained maybe 10 20 fps on average I'd say with a 3070ti GPU But every CPU bound scenario is 10x better
what factually a lie 3600 and 5700xt upgrade cpu you absolutely gain fps even though your gpu is the same games aren't just graphics there are many workloads that run on the cpu not to mention the gpu gets told what to do from the cpu that's common knowledge for anyone who knows how computers actually work on the clip side he can keep his 3600 and get a new gpu like a 4080 or 7900xtx but he will STILL be limited by the cpu because it just can't handle the game nor the new gpu my 3950x 6900xt to 7700 6900xt doubled my fps in every title at a minimum same games i get 3 4x more fps valorant cs go league of legends overwatch there was THAT MUCH performance on the table all because AMD cpu's just weren't holding up in gaming the 5800x3d and 7000 series are the first products from AMD to match intel in gaming even beating it in some games i have a buddy with 2070 and 2700x he upgraded to 7700x and kept the 2070 his fps doubled in every title he plays his gpu is much slower than mine but from HIS baseline to his new performance its double period 60fps to 120fps for him is double in valorant he went from 150 200fps to 300 450fps that is slightly over double i went from 90fps to 180fps in the same title double gains in valorant i went from 250 average to 450 average and peaking to 900fps at times YES my gains are bigger because my gpu is faster but that's because my baseline wa already higher the biggest issue with most AMD fans is the ignorant of a quality cpu I love AMD I've been on team red since the 1800x launch and I upgraded to 3950x and now on 7700x and the whole time I knew if I had just bought intel I could have doubled my fps but i dont like intel products its just my preference i took a performance hit knowing amd wasn't as good at gaming but now that's no longer the meme amd competes in gaming
Noctua NH D15 Yeah I that cooler should keep it around 75 80c
6800xt reference model
I think if I was pointing fingers it would be at motherboard manufacturers and retailers before AMD seeing how AMD has basically 0 direct control over pricing
6 cores is the minimum needed to maintain high performance in all Games 4 will be fine for most but there will be cases a 6 core will improve performance They just need to adjust their pricing hierarchy It's 2022 and they're using the same launch prices for the same number of cores since 2016 Their CCX's contain more cores than before They recently reduced their pricing by a little
Eliminate r9 Lol how would they address the HEDT market that they used to address with Threadripper Those people are buying 400 motherboards without blinking and are happy to drop almost a band on a processor People are so focused on the value end of the market that they forget who's paying the bills
6 cores are the ultimate sweet spot the first tier of CPU where you won't hinder game performance from having Discord open or whatever
6 core CPUs have the same amount of L3 as 8 core
Logistics costs went up electricity went up silicon went up retooling costs a lot especially on this scale especially especially with LGA Capacitors alone went up 20 in terms of cost PCBs went up and Mobos have a lotta that Epoxy went up Copper went up by a huge amount As did nickel Coal prices tripled meaning more electricity costs meaning more costs on literally every layer of production If electricity costs went up 30 on a product that costs 10 and goes through 5 companies each company needs to increase it by 30 Not additively but multiplicatively Someone who works in the business will tell you the same I know because I'm adjacent to the industry
But electricity is 1000 and raw materials are in hundreds too
Idk but at place i like they were 4 25 now they are 7 5 they are actually cheaper than most places except fast food if not a combo but idk i would not even call that a burger at all
I didn't say 20 either I said 50 Alright there's no way in hell you are legitimately that fucking dense Have a good one
I was around since SDR DDR4 was around since 2014 and was fairly cheap by itself The issue isn't thst stuff but the controllers There's a lot more that goes into running newer hardware than just the hardware itself
I'm sorry that was a guess from me I don't actually know the real reason why Intel got most if not all of the credit if you think I was wrong here There are just some things that many big businesses will keep a trade secret maybe for a long time As to the socket by AMD that you had trouble remember I found it off of Wikipedia designed for AMD's Operton line of server and workstation CPUs There was a modified version of this socket named Socket 1207 FX by AMD and Socket L1 by NVIDIA from 11 30 2006 Made for AMD's Quad FX platform I think this one only lasted for about a year until 2007 so I wasn't surprised you would have trouble recalling this socket type
yeah an in socket upgrade is what I will have to go for now but there is a lot of value to me in the onboard graphics on the 7000 series
That little 1600 6 core and the 580 absolutely outperform my PS5 in every metric Simply not true as the hardware in the PS5 is superior in every way to either of those
Lmao nice fairytale bro
I don t Didn t question that Irrelevant Didn t even insinuate that you presumably expect AMD to support their old platform for eternity or something I said slowly but surely not nuking every AM4 system on the planet This has nothing to do with my reply We do they aren t There s a rumor Is there Because if so you re the only one in on it The last time it was rumored with any credibility the leaker said the info would be available on them in July and well it s not July anymore is it The only plans going forward for AMD involve AM5 and that is apparent These rumors make about as much sense if not less as Intel making more LGA 1200 CPUs
Agree Amazon is pretty hot garbage these days I also hate how they commingle 3rd party inventory with their own Can get a knock off It s really devolved into something not so different from Wish in many cases You really have to be careful
a 5800x3d would feel so much better though going from 3000 series to any 5000 pretty much is a massive improvement in terms of frame pacing and responsiveness Upgrade CPU first is a good call here and then he's gonna be able to feed the new grapphics card properly everyone has this backwards most of the time
Typically you'd be correct but the 3d cache makes a significant improvement in games as that's its intention You will definitely see a noticeable increase in performance with any recent GPU There's a reason this CPU can keep up with 7000 and 13th gen CPUs
You are only giving e sport games as an example In most games there wont be a difference with that GPU also the 3600 is quite a bit faster than the 2700x the main thing holding him back is the gpu
Yeah go intel and double your FPS rolling on the floor laughing CPU is gonna double your FPS only in very specific scenarios Give a look at some Benchmark you won't pull FPS out of your ass just because you bought the latest CPU
I wouldn t say they have 0 control but yeah I would point fingers at mobo manufacturers first
They're saying that they cost what an 8 core should cost and you may as well just get the 8 core for the money and the absolute middle of the road computing which is not gaming can still be done on dual and quad cores so it's doesn't make sense as a budget option either The problem with the Year Of Our Lord argument is that the computing needs of consumers doesn't justify changing the core layout of their product stack It's the same reason Intel had quad core i7s for so long the tiny minority of people who wanted 6 or 8 cores were ok being on HEDT and quad cores satisfied most power users Even now quad cores are still fine for gaming for the most part
I'm not saying 6 cores are bad I'm saying that the 7600x at msrp is horrible value A 7600x for 220 Sure A 4core zen4 that can do 5ghz At 100 Better It can carry you over till the 8 or 9 thousand series exist The gpu is always a better purchase
Amd ruined threadripper i hope intel can compete soon
With a proper HEDT platform with quad channel at at least 12 gen5 lanes dedicated to nvmes
were
AM4 had 50 boards AM5 starts at 125 what does that have to do with prices of high end motherboards 20 years ago
I remember vividly I posted a meme about x570 pricing in this subreddit got 600 upvotes within a few minutes and got banned for it xD The criticism died down because B550 has arrived with decently priced boards 100 to 150 Euro range
How much value The iGPUs in the non G Zen 4 CPUs are not capable of gaming whatsoever and are significantly weaker than any of the iGPUs found in the AM4 CPUs If you actually want to use the iGPU for anything other than troubleshooting just get the 5700g
What about the 5600X and 6700 XT Will it last until next gen
You honestly think AMD is dropping AM4 just like that when it has the biggest installed user base and plenty of users looking to upgrade it That is not realistic That is not what they say they're planning to do it's not what is likely or reasonable to expect and it's not the wise thing to do When you have a huge installed user base you keep supporting it They've made it abundantly clear that they consider AM5 their new high end mid range platform and AM4 their low end platform There are no low end AM5 CPUs on the market and there won't be for a long while Look at how long it took them to start offering lower end AM4 CPUs based on Zen 3 Some of them were released this year 2 years after the initial launch of Zen 3 You're delusional if you think AMD are going to suddenly drop the biggest platform we've ever had in PCs Look at Amazons best selling CPUs list 8 out of 10 CPUs are for AM4
Yeah I hate these marketplaces I buy strictly from Amazon now I don't care if it is extra I've been burned on blu rays and stuff already I've also gone back to buying shit in stores because at least then I know its authentic
I don t agree Having a gpu upgrade will benefit for most games Starting with the cpu is an upgrade for sure but a minor one If he starts with the gpu that will be a massive jump and then upgrading the cpu is a nice jump again If it is the other way around the cpu upgrade will be minor and then the gpu a huge jump I would go the two meaningful jumps round instead of the one small one large But in the end the result will be the same
My 6900xt and 3600 disagrees with cpu upgrade priority
I literally upgraded I see first hand But keep smoking that youtube crack rots your brain
I think you a word when you were reading my comment
They're disregarding the thermal part of the equation We've already seen that the x600x series can sometimes outperform the x800x from the same generation in gaming workloads because of the better heat dissipation and core scheduling I chose a 5600x over a 5800x for exactly this reason despite a relatively small price gap
They discontinued x399 because they want it all for Epyc You have to go significantly up market for that There is still a huge demand for that middle ground
AM4 boards were launched at 200 to begin the conversation Plus AM4 launched 6 years ago
Yep Now add all of the retooling costs and the fact that mobos quite literally cost more with LGA sockets and you get current pricing especially if you include everything else I mentioned in another post Motherboards do genuinely cost more quite a bit 700 series will probably launch cheaper than 600
Because it would help with troubleshooting at work i frankly don't care in the slightest how good the onboard graphics are just them being there would be a huge time saver
Yes It is realistic it s kind of what has happened with every CPU socket ever manufactured when a new one has come out to replace it so there is a precedent here Some examples AM4 AM3 AM2 AM1 FM2 LGA 1200 LGA 1151 and every other consumer desktop CPU socket released in the history of humankind proceeding the AM5 and LGA 1700 socket I m sorry for your loss of the AM4 platform It will be dearly missed by me as well but no there will be no more AM4 CPUs Users already have something to upgrade to the 5800x3d Are you extremely disappointed with the 5800x3d s performance metrics There will be nothing better or well worse in fact dropping on the AM4 platform so that s what people wanting to upgrade are stuck with Because they re on a dead platform The dead old no more CPUs ever going to come out again one AM4 I must have missed the part where they said that AM5 is the high end platform and AM4 is the low end one could you perhaps share where they say this exact statement the one that made it abundantly clear to you and not everyone else who is also following AMDs releases closely Thanks
i was GPU bound with my 1070 when i moved from a 3800xt to a 5900x and immmediately could feel the difference if he had say a 5600x and was talking about a 5800x3d upgrade I'd say GPU first but in this case the frame pacing of the 5000 series is so much better it still should be a tangible upgrade I buck the trend of unbalanced builds with a low end CPU with 3200mhz ram powering a 3090 or some shit like that What tends to happen in those cases is the card is too demanding of your system and you see this manifest in things like stutters especially if you're trying to squeak by without a power supply upgrade as well the reality is no one wants to hear that they should probably do a whole platform upgrade if they want a particular graphics card and there are a lot of issues people have that myself and others who have a tendency to lean the balance more towards the CPU simply don't have most people wanna be in discord calls with multiple browser tabs open listning to music or whatever while in their game and this is another use case where building out your CPU first is helpful down the road because while everything may be fine with your old GPU that can only get like 60fps in a title what happens when you upgrade to something that can push 300 basically im just saying that most people would have better experiences if they shifted their mentality a bit went down a peg or two on the graphics card and put those savings into the cpu and memory especially with ryzen just seeing framerate numbers on a bar chart doesnt really give you any indication of how a game feels to play this is the same mentality that has people going 'oh you dont need cores for games' well in fact thats entirely dependent on the game and since most people seem to be in discord calls watching a youtube video with multiple tabs open while gaming yeah actually just from that they would benefit from an 8 core instead of a 6 beyond that I monitor my thread usage all the time in games and the reality is most modern games ARE heavily using your threads games like Warzone for example or any current multiplayer game Or Cyberpunk so there'e a lotta misconceptions about these things and ofc no one will listen to me here and I get it its not as sexy to upgrade your memory or your cpu compared to your gpu and you'll pull benchmark numbers on a graph chart from your favorite techtuber who doesnt play games to prove me wrong but the few other cats out there that understand about focusing the build a little more on the cpu they know
I'm sure your locked 60fps games are very fun for you but some people want more octane
It's because of better boosts and games not utilising 16 threads any better than 12 not because of thermals
Your examples don't make sense since you claim AMD dropped AM4 when they did the opposite and reiterated their continued support for it in the future I must have missed the part where they said that AM5 is the high end platform and AM4 is the low end one could you perhaps share where they say this exact statemen I guess you did But no I'm not going to google that for you I AM going to show you this though 't enough to convince you nothing would be able to ever If Lisa Su came to your house to tell you in person you wouldn't budge So this is futile
While there is absolutely truth in what you are saying and I am not advocating towards unbalanced builds but for gaming going for a cpu overkill is less of an upgrade than gpu And yes cpu provides some stability but from experience I don t share your opinion Also talking about background tasks etc check here and here Hardware unboxed explains and tests the cores and background tasks In the end I don t think that upgrading to a MUCH faster gpu without a cpu upgrade in the pipeline is a great plan but for me going with the gpu is the better starting point
Boosts are thermal
Dawg I m convinced this is a schizophrenia reply or something cause this just don t make no sense I ll reply to this comment in a year when there still aren t any more AM4 CPUs to check up on you RemindMe 1 year
lol the inevitable HuB link I dont need to watch that Ive seen most of them anyway x200B I can show you gaming clips that show my thread usage with literally nothing running but the game modern games use threads if they are coded properly this is a fact and regarding the cpu thing It's not gonna be the same for every use case in this particular one im just saying that going from a 3000 to a 5000 series will be noticeable even with a gpu bottleneck if he's competitive at all and or sensitive to responsiveness and games feeling fluid he will notice
I'll also clarify that games are not not taking advantage of additional cores because of poor architecture coding it has more to do with the nature of games and the information being progressively processed IE you can't process x until after y which is why single core is still the number one predictor of gaming performance when dependent on CPU
No they are not purely thermal limited It's the power limit that your hit when increasing core count usually as well as statistical limits cause by the probability of having a potato core being higher when you have eight of them than when you have six
Do you know the term fact resistant EDIT I'm not able to see your comments or reply to them since you apparently blocked me Which is quite cowardly and shows me that you at least know that you're wrong but just too stubborn to admit it
I resent you putting the lazy Devs narrative words in my mouth Clarify to someone who implied that
The sources I look at do individual unit min max as well as average across all samples Individual is just as limited as max max or min min in these cases These are not statistical models but real world benchmarks Sure there are other MINOR factors but in all the cases I've seen the temperature limits are what caused the core throttling probably because of the increased load on all components and minimal benefits of additional cores It doesn't really matter because at the end of the day the 6 core 12 thread units do perform much better for gaming workloads which is the context of the discussion at hand
You just sent me a link to Amazon s best selling list as where AMD told only you that there would be more AM4 CPUs Fact resistant is probably how I would describe someone who has determined that their unsubstantiated head canon about a dead CPU platform of all things is right Not to mention this belief being formed by a complete misinterpretation of a simple phrase recognized by the entirety of the community they are engaging with to mean something else I am not going to argue about a dead CPU socket of all things anymore
Is this not a public forum I didn't imply that you didn't already understand that I was clarifying for the sake of the thread
Raise the problem directly to the relevant department of AMD AMD Rewards they are very understanding with their customers and you will see that they will force these Amazon to respect their commitments and not to modified them as it suits them
Have you got another game with your purchase or not I bought 6600 last year and given a system code instead of gpu I had to contact my seller to get the specified one
I purchased the 7950X earlier this month from Amazon made sure it was from Amazon and not a third party seller with the game offer visible on the product page The offer details said I'd receive a code within 5 days of purchase so I reached out to find out why I hadn't received one yet The first customer service representative looked into it and said The offer only applies to Ryzen 7000 not the Ryzen 9 7950X I believe he didn't know that the 7000 meant the SERIES not a specific model I clarified for him and he said he'd escalate it to the Promotion and Marketing team The Promotion and Marketing team eventually replied also saying my order didn't 's at the bottom of my attached image clearly showing the item I ordered is part of the promo but haven't heard back
They screwed me when I bought my 6800xt during Christmas week After a month of fighting i got a 120 credit and just used that to buy parts Worked out since Callisto Protocol didn't review well and i don't have faith in Dead Island 2
Yes I was also going to suggest that you raise your issue with AMD rewards Please keep us posted on the outcome
email jeff mailto jeff its the special cust support they will ether fix it or give you a better answer why you don't qualify
i had a similar issue only they literally gave me a code that didn't work when i went to enter it and that was for the uncharted bundle i contacted AMD for that issue
They will just answer 'until supplies last' and you ordered after they always find a way to not give you anything
Return it
It literally says on the product page lol wtf
The same thing happened to me last year with the uncharted bundle and the 5000 series CPUs I ended up contacting Amazon live chat and they kept denying that the promotion existed even after sending links and explaining that it literally shows the promotion on the product listing Even then they kept denying it and so I kept asking to be moved up the chain by the time I reached the supervisor they caved in and sent me a partial refund for the value of the game which was very lucky This was after being on livechat for many hours Bottom line is I will never trust Amazon with they game promotions anymore Clearly they have an issue with honouring them
I had a similar issue with the Uncharted bundle when I bought my R7 5800X After enough complaining nicely not being a douche and like 5 transfers they refunded me the value of the game 45 iirc They wanted to just give me 5 but I hounded them saying and this is true the bundle was part of the reason I bought the CPU during that sale So yeah keep hounding them and they'll give
also just try chatting with them again amazon cs is very much hit or miss
Happened the same to me with a 5000 Series CPU during the Uncharted promotion
I had the same issue with COH3 and a 5800X3D on Amazon France some rare people seam to have received the game from amazon but they are telling to contact AMD on their website it's wrote to contact seller and that they can't give me a
I would also report Amazon to the FTC while you continue to follow up and they should know better Even if they had run out of supplies of the free gift I think you could probably argue that they should provide you a gift of at least equal value which is exactly what AMD's terms for the campaign talk about Since Amazon are saying whoops actually we lied and there's no free gift I think it would qualify as false advertising bait switch whatever you want to call it IANAL Also if you contact Amazon again don't be afraid to politely but firmly ask to be escalated until you get your issue resolved In big companies sometimes front line support can be hit and miss It's clear some of that is going on since the first rep lacked understanding of what the problem was I had that happen once when I bought a TV from Amazon and the first line support couldn't understand that I had received a different TV from the one that I had ordered After I talked to a manager everything was cleared up Despite being a meme sometimes let me speak to your manager is the correct action I hope you get a response back from AMD as others have mentioned that might be the best way to go about it since they're the ones running the campaign and they can go and bully their partners Amazon to actually honor whatever contract they have
Make sure you take a screen shot of the sales page when you purchase Newegg sent me a refurbished motherboard when it was sold as new I took a screen shot of the page 6 months later the board died so I started the RMA process through MSI It was not taking the serial number So I called them and they said it was a referb that only had a 90 day warranty Told me to contact newegg Contacted newegg and they told me it was sold as refurbished So I sent them the screen shot the page when I purchased it They tried everything they could not to refund my money Took me about three months of harassing them before they caved and gave me my money back
I purchased a ryzen 5600 and didn't receive Company of Heroes
It will arrive later on via email Give it time Support has no idea It will come eventually
I got my 7600x back in December Sad I missed out on the Star Wars Code
This might be to do with the game getting delayed until close to the final redemption date I recently bought a CPU from ocuk the day after the promotion was pulled from advertisement and I had to request the code Unfortunately I can't offer any more advice than what's been stated
Always try to provide you the best possible resolution The best possible resolution would be giving him the damn code
This same shit happened with the 3 games that were supposed to come with my damn 6700xt
definitely try again with another rep I purchased a 7600x a couple weeks ago and got the code from amazon a couple days later
Amazon did the same thing to me with multiple service reps Purchased an 6900 XTXH with the promotion for 2 Free Games Resident Evil Village and Far Cry 6 with an Xbox Gamepass Code one was already redeemed a few months prior so they sent me 1 dead code and the other one for the two games was actually the code for the Xbox Gamepass as well and they were no help still I even called multiple times and used their online text chat At one point they transferred me to a hair company Terrible Customer Service representatives and contact options Literally wasted days of my time Keep in mind the GPU worked fine they kept trying to get me to refund or return it Posted a review on the Product to Amazon and they deleted it for whatever reason Reached out to AMD Rewards and they helped me out big time
Return it and buy from MicroCenter They have the same deal Ryzen 9 7900x ASUS B650E F G SKILL 32GB DDR5 and Jedi Survivor 600 By the time I got home code for game was chillin' in my inbox
Amazon can lick my fuckin pecker
I always doubt if I would order something from Amazon cheaper or other webshops with great cs These kind of posts still made me realize paying a little more is still a good choice
Keep us posted
Not cool not cool at all Mr Bezos Bad ass CPU upgrade nevertheless congratz
The normal problem is when people order not from amazon but from a seller on amazon it has happened before Not all sellers have the promotion codes from AMD If you are not happy return the CPU and buy from a shop that has the promotion
I would call your bank and dispute the charge If the product does not match what was advertised your bank can get all of your money back
That sucks I had this happen when I bought a 5800X3D that was supposed to include the upcoming Medal of Honor game When I reached out to Amazon support they gave me a 60 00 dollar gift card
was this promotion offered on February 5th not trying to be snarky I just didn't see anything in the comments and I've only recently heard of this deal
Same I also didn t get my code
I bought my 5600 from Newegg and the game codes immediately came with the receipt If Amazon won't honor this promotion make this public on Twitter or something tagging AMD in it
Amazon hates returns so another option to pursue is initiate return with customer service since Amazon didn't fulfill their end of the purchase contract unless they refund 69 99 which is the cost to pre order the game from Steam
This makes me no longer want to purchase PC components from Amazon If they don t honor their free games offered with hardware I wonder what else they wont honor
I hate Amazon so much
Thing is the notice says select AMD processors so they probably didn't intend to include this one But it could be argued as false advertising to have this notice appear on the product page for a processor that isn't included I would email them the bottom image and point that out and say you'd like to escalate the complaint to the highest level possible It's not your fault to have assumed it was part of the deal It even says applicable promotion
Try again with Amazon cust service They now routinely throw first response to some clueless moron they've barely trained 1st escalation tends to get a totally different answer Had a problem with a baby monitor they'd told me I needed to contact manufacturer and sent a list of suggested URLs Was clear the rep had just banged the name in Google was a contact lense manufacturer a cookie making website a web page maker etc Genuinely embarrassingly bad first touch Seems normal now with Amazon they're a crappy Chinese knock off drop shipper these days
I still build these bloody things occasionally for work I didn't get it either
I had an issue similar to this I bought a wireless G502 and they sent me a wired one I sent it back as not as described and then they sent me a replacement Also a wired G502 Then I called back and spoke to a supervisor and explained how this was false advertising and they just needed to send me a wireless G502 like it says on the product page It took a while but they finally caved and sent me what I originally ordered So I would talk to a supervisor and explain how this is fraud and false advertising and if they don't fix the issue report them to the FBI for online theft fraud and false advertising
Just keep and I received a refund of 69 99 to cover a cost of a brand new one Basically it took long for thier systems to issue the promotional credit for the game advertised for
I had a similar issue with Amazon I preordered Battlefield 4 from them to get the special knife unlock Don t judge I m a huge fan of BF2142 and the knife was from that game I ordered two copies one for me and one for my wife They would only provide me with one unlock code though It didn t matter how much I escalated they wouldn t budge So I emailed Bezo s supposed personal address and the person that answered got me the second code immediately I hope this works out for you
Noted I ll buy my 7600x from B H
Just replace the new cpu with the old in the box and return it skull and crossbones Amazon sucks anyways
Is this Amazon s fault or AMDs fault
They probably messed up getting you the code now AMD won't give them anymore to make it right and the customer service people don't know what to do I sold 100 PCs into a large school district during a similar Nvidia promo and our procurement folks messed up on the request and Nvidia told us to kick rocks
Amazon are scum and I would avoid any purchase of any time from their fraudulent business
On a side note AMD themselves are giving the proverbial middle finger to RX 7000 series GPU owners Fancy new expensive cards and no free game promotion
also i thought only prime users only get the download digital content for free plus promotion ones only goes toward prime members read the fine print again also try to get more proof than email and product page
Oh fuck those standard copy paste answers
Send this picture to them
If the game is anything like Jedi Fallen Order it will be a major stutterfest so you aren't missing out on much gif emote free emotes pack sweat smile
send the motherfucker back buy intel and tell em to stick their amd up their ass Bought a AMD 7900X e f wifi Fucking Ram dont even work on the board ASUS having alot of issues with DDR5 ram compatibility Returned it went with intel i9 Threadripper can kiss my ass asus tuf z790 plus wifi gskill 32gb ddr5 6000 kit computer build combo asus tuf z790 plus wifi gskill 32gb ddr5 6000 kit computer build combo and this is stock no overclock
Jedi survivor isn't even being released until the end of April
if I read this right the seller was Amazon not AMD I am not even sure AMD has a Amazon store I just returned a cPU that was also not legible to the seller Why you may ask Let me tell you What I got was a Tray CPU meant for Systemintegrators Those are usually cheaper to obtain for the vendors but they are neither legible for the AMD 3 year warrenty the system integrator gives warrenty on its machines and also not for the AMD boxed CPU goodies This willnot be boxed CPUs and as those no game code no 3 year warrenty short if it is marketed as a boxed CPU but is not delivered in a box like displayed it is a Tray or OEM CPU for system integrators You can find out if you have a boxed or OEM Try CPU by looking at the ID of the CPU it is listed on the CPU itself CPU ids AMD Ryzen 7xxx if you have a CPU with letters in the end of the ID you get the game if you have one without yer fucked If you get a CPU in a box like this pruchasing it as a boxed CPU non boxed CPU contact seller demand a boxed one or a discount or return it you got scammed by the seller I contected my seller and got offered a 40 bucks discount wasn't worth it
They keyword here is select AMD 7000 s Not all of them Some of them that they have selected That comment in the store front page is merely an advertisement to make you consider getting a different CPU that actually includes the game
game probably shit and boring i wouldnt play it anyways
Jedi Survivor hasn t even come out yet
Why is AMD having blunder after blunder They really cannot afford to keep doing this
its scam i went through entire post and i found out this user is defruading amazon and amazon is not stupid to detect a scammer like this
I had the same problem after I bought a 7700X
Amazon did this for my 5700xt I had to escalate it to get my promotion Super annoying
Odd I actually ordered my 6700xt at the same time a promotion for Callisto protocol and dead island two were going on I actually didn t receive the code via email it came to some weird messages section in Amazon forgot how I found it though Maybe that s where your code lives Maybe you ve already checked out something like that before Idk when I get home I can look to elaborate with more details
I got my code from Amazon for my 7700x I redeemed it earlier this week
Had this happen to me with a card from a catalogue argued blue they didn't have to supply it and ended up knocking 60 off the cost
A few weeks ago I received the email and was able to redeem
Weird question was it in a full retail box or alternative packaging A friend of mine ordered a CPU recently and they sent her an OEM CPU might be that they only offer it with retail boxes
I didn't get my Uncharted copy when I bought a 5700x either Amazon just seems to be scum bags with bundled software
Wow I had the opposite thing happen with Newegg I bought a 6600 on a restock the one time there wasn t the two codes and then like 3 days later it came back with one and their support just gave me one anyways
I actually bought a 6750xt last year and never got Callisto Protocol or Dead Island 2 codes either Not my cup of tea so I didn't go back and fight for the codes Seems like maybe a recurring thing
Probably that amazon had a certain number of codes that AMD provided them and they should delist that promotion Or it is written in the conditions of the promo
Wow customer service is pooping out words so freely
you just got until supply last d my friend
I had the same thing when I bought my 5700XT a few years ago was advertised that it came with two free games but when i went to redeem the codes it said the offer had expired months before the purchase date
When I did it they said they would send it to my remake but they sent it to my amazon messages and I didn t find out till a month later so check your Amazon messages
Kinda surprised that even with the screenshot they didn't help I find they like to pretend that promotions don't exist but when you send a screenshot they suddenly find the record in their system Of course most people dont take screenshots of everything on the offchance they get scammed
I guess this deal didn' survive
Pulled the exact same shit with a 970 I bought years ago with Rainbow 6 Seige
It used to be that you input your serial number onto an official AMD website to get your code for things like this you don't just get a code from the seller
i had the same issue with the uncharted bundle amazon is useless with their support if the issue isnt on their flow chart
I would say if they dont honor send the thing back and try to find it out or around same price I mean Amazon has been shotty lately
They refunded me for an item I explicitly stated that I would not be returning IMO their customer service is extremely error prone in this case it but you in the ass File again and escalate
Yep same thing happened to me Fuck em
Amazon support quality went down a lot in the last years In the past they ALWAYS solved my problems and these days you mostly talk to someone from India who doesn't really understand your problem answers with a translation bot and never solves your problem and then gives you thousands of I'm sorry you are really appreciated
Amazon is horrible with promos its hit and miss I bought a GPU once and got the promos but when amd was running latest promos on the RDNA2 few months back I didn't get the promo after the a week of card being delivered Their chat support only tells you what you wanna hear Heard nothing back after chatting for a week I just returned the card Kinda crazy how its a hit and miss with them and they rather take open box back to take a hit
Bought 5950x on Amazon and it show up damage so I returned and it show it arrive back to their facility First it state 14 days return policy turn to 60 days return Unbelievable Who think it s acceptable that it takes 60 days to process a return
I think it's because it says shipped and sold from by A and that listing says you are buying from the AMD store page It's a small technical difference
That's really weird When I bought my 5700XT the next day they started a promo that gave me Resident Evil 3 and one other game for free I thought that I just missed out on it Then I checked my junk folder a day later and found the codes there
Weird had no issues with bestbuy in canada with this promotion
Until Supplies Last
Why does anyone hardware from Amazon site is rife with knockoffs and scams and some of the delivery providers are extra generous with the kick force over your fence on delivery Seems even first party is pulling shit now Amazon remains the cheap chinese tat I can't find anywhere else that doesn't plug into anything only site to me
I think it's good time to let Steve Gamers Nexus know about this for his investigation
Had a similar issue last fall with the 5800X3D Uncharted Stay polite but firm and keep escalating and also try AMD help I got a code after a few rounds of live chat Good luck
A store on amazon posted a r7 5800 for 200 and tried to guilt me to cancel I ended up getting the cpu but i had to email and complian Go to customer service and on my frienda advice make sure to swear Not at them exactly but using coarse language often signals a customer is at the end of their wits Always worked for me
People shit on Newegg but they did end up giving me the Callisto protocol and dead Island 3 for free when I ordered just before the deal kicked in
First off urg Also the 3 paragraphs saying We want to do the best on repeat without offering any shadow of a
Don't buy hardware at Amazon
Last time I got a game from AMD was Half Life 2 The promos mean nothing never buy a GPU CPU etc based on free software it's very likely you won't get it
Amazon is goofy as fuck
Bh did this to me on uncharted
Not read many answers but it looks like the Bundle was made for the 799 price and not the new price which was 210 discount which would cover the price of the game P S I have never ever had a free game here in the Far East after buying dozens upon dozens of Graphics cards CPU s Motherboards Such this past decade or so Thank the Universe when you do get a freebie it isn t mandatory
hmmm i bought the 7700 in January never got a code for the game
Refund and rebuy
It clearly says when shipped and sold by amazon Can you verify that u bought yours from Amazon directly
This happend to me too once I then complained and got 50 off my CPU At the same time i got the codes by contacting AMD directly
same here i was meant to get a game back in november last year but never got it when i got my 6650xt i think the game was calistico protocol
Amazon's been F'ing up alot recently It seems quite a few companies aren't wanting to hold up their end of promotions etc
I am altering the deal Pray I do not alter it further
I purchased a 7900x through newegg 2 weeks ago and I got my code However whenever I try to redeem it on the EA app like the email states it says it is invalid
isbot Ill Career6870
Ryzen 5 7600 does not include the game promo on the product store page but it does on the promo details 's a trap
Call your card issuer and charge it back under did not receive goods as listed They then have to prove it to your card issuer that you did not qualify you have proof you did provide the code or you get your money back
Thanks I reached out to them and attached the same image of the correspondence with Amazon's customer service Hopefully they can make something happen
Yup I got a free copy of windows that I didn't actually get until I bitched and moaned to AMD Rewards which then turned into Amazon honoring the promotion Apparently I ordered the product at 12 17pm and the promotion ended at 12 00pm which is total bullshit Saved me 100 or some torrenting Most people will see an offer for a code for a game Check spam mail as well Unfortunately for me Amazon sellers aren't really supposed to give out free copies of Windows lol
I've had this happen before like 7 8 years ago Absolutely insane that they're still doing it
Nope I didn't receive any other games or offers
Yep it's been a problem before when people used 3rd party sellers to be fair amazon changed there UI so now it's harder to see who the seller is The amazon UI change relay bugs me the new google UI is making me think about switching search engine Why do they make UI's so bad
Promos for games are a lie in the first place
The offer says select AMD Ryzen 7000 series not all Ryzen 7000 Also says until supplies last
I had the same problem but it turns out because I m m not from the us so it doesn t my apply Rx580
Amazon customer service is all outsourced to a 3rd world country where they don't give a shit
Yeah you got the better end of stick there Would rather have 120 than both of those games
You probably had the same promo as me the code won t go to your email it ll be in the Amazon messages chances are that codes still there
Dead island will be good Even when the game was shitty back in the day it was good Sucks you ll miss a good game
I got screwed by that too Didn't get codes nor any plan B's And now my 6800XT has died and is being RMA'd Fantastic
Screwed me out of games on HD6870 7870Ghz 290X MBA 6800 Don't buy GPUs with the expectation that promos are real
Just in case people aren't aware that's the email for Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon That indeed would be the nuclear option but it's far more likely you'll just be ignored as spam since he does not deal with such things personally He says he does I do not believe it
Wait for real I had to deal with non english speaking CS at Amazon FR recently because a product was missing from my package and they wouldn't want to speak English
They should have removed the promotion if supplies had run out That reason doesn't cut the mustard in terms of their consumer rights
grinning face with sweatlike they're gonna run out of game codes
It could be listed on the wrong page it certainly wouldn't be the first time something like that has happened However checking the promotion page still lists the 7950x as part of the deal so it does count
If it was shipped and sold from Amazon We don't know if he did or not based on what was provided to us
Bitches didnt even refund me the games just said it aint their problem when it clearly was
How did you enjoy the game
did you make sure your retailer was part of the program
I forgot what game I got last night but it said wait 48 hours for the email
Yeah I made sure that it was sold by Amazon not another seller If they don't resolve the issue I do plan on returning it
Also this approach has the added benefit of not having to wait around on hold with AMD support agents who don't give a fuck about you or your problems Raising the issue with your bank puts the burden of responsibility on them saving you loads of time and frustration
The promotion started Jan 24th and ends April 1st
this can always be checked at
The promotion is for anyone who buys a Ryzen 7000 series desktop CPU doesn t matter if you re a Prime member or not Also I AM a Prime member so it doesn t matter either way I have more proof that I ve shared with Amazon but I m not posting it to Reddit
Weird I didn t have any issues with Fallen Order
They give you a code that redeems it once the game comes out This isn t anything new I ve gotten a few games in the past from similar promotions with pre release codes
The seller was Amazon not AMD that's correct Amazon is a verified retailer for the promotion on AMD's page I ensured when I ordered it that it was the listing from Amazon and not a third party through Amazon I also received a Boxed CPU not an OEM tray CPU
If you click on the promo for more details on the Amazon page it lets you select an item that qualifies The 7950X is one of them
Did you not like the first one Personally I thought Jedi Fallen Order was pretty good
That doesn't mean they can't send out codes Other buyers have already received theirs Lots of CPU and GPU promos in the past have included pre load codes It'll unlock the game and show it in your library but won't download install til release
How am I defrauding Amazon exactly If anything they re defrauding me by saying I d get a code but not sending me one
Mine arrived in the full retail box
Yup Shipped and sold by Amazon
It was shipped in a poly pad mail envelope instead of box for some reason
Nah Amazon is a verified reseller for the promotion it qualifies as long as I bought the listing specifically sold by A
Look again under the Buy Now button It's shipped and sold by Amazon The link under the item name is just there to take you to the AMD themed section on Amazon where you can browse everything AMD
I doubt they bought it based on getting this game
The promo started Jan 24th I think Wouldn t be eligible if you bought before that
Yes the one I bought is shipped and sold by Amazon
Still haven t gotten a code so I returned mine I believe you re supposed to redeem the code here not the EA app
I purchased a 7950x 3 weeks ago and received the code in an email a day after purchase Amazon is screwing something up on this one
AMDs support is pretty awesome when I bought a Vega 56 it came with a game code I couldn't remember which game it is but the code was invalid due to Amazon sending out expired ones After attaching the emails showing Amazon's Promotion Department not wanting to help they were quick to issue a new one
Pls when you come back with news Reply to this comment
Nah Just return the fucking CPU as broken Amazon have no way to check and you'll cost them hundreds of dollars
Please give us an update when you get it
2 gens later and I see that they're still facing the same issues I had a similar issue with another retailer when I bought my 3900X I contacted AMD Rewards here was their answer Hello xxxx If you did not receive a coupon code or did not receive all of your rewards please contact your retailer to receive them Unfortunately we do not distribute codes on our end as participating retailers are responsible for giving them out when an eligible product is purchased for the promotion We advise customers to check with their retailers before the purchase to ensure that they are participating in our promo Codes are valid while supplies last If you do not see the promotion on your retailer's website the promotion may either have been exhausted or the retailer may not be participating Please note that sometimes the retailer does not provide a redeemable code until after the initial return period Please try to keep a log of all your communication with your retailer as we may need this information in case we have to escalate your case internally We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding The story ends up by me not having the game
Dude the game isn't out until the end of April I bought my 5800x3d when they had the Uncharted promo and got the code for it a few weeks later once the game came out Don't pay attention to the amazon rep they have no clue what they're talking about
have you tried chat support instead of email there you can speak to a live agent and i get better help there then emailing them
Got a 7900x last week and my code works Even bought mine from BHPhoto First time using the site and I thought it was a scam at first But they still came through
What did they end up saying I have the same problem with Amazon right now
For what a Windows 10 11 license key is actually worth on the gray market today Amazon is neither hot nor cold trust me
Absolutely insane I'm going with like mildly bothersome
Mine was definitely directly from Amazon not a third party Even my invoice has the seller Sold by A
It's because tech giants are fucking cancerous I use DuckDuckGo or Bing and use Google as little as possible nowadays Everything from search to Gmail is garbage now
Bad for the consumer good for profits
I already partially switched when I got access to the new bing I use both pretty regularly Google is still better when it comes to raw search so I use it for school research projects and all though bing is really good when I don't want to just search something up
Because muh metrics
That s why I use Firefox DuckDuckGo and Protonmail Never had an issue at all with this combination and I never receive spam emails
Why do they make UIs so bad I think the issue is that the design teams responsible for them are constantly looking for ways to build a better prettier mousetrap because they want to look like they re doing something productive so that they can keep their jobs
They make the UI bad so people make profitable mistakes and click on more of the content they get paid to show you
s referencing this promo from AMD and that page lists which processors qualify which is basically all desktop 7000 series CPUs Also if you click the Find Retailers link from AMDs page it lists Amazon as one of the participating ones And even furthermore if you click the promo on Amazon s own site it brings you to a page that lets you add qualifying items The 7950X is on the list
Yeah you can't even sell the codes I got em for free when I bought my Asus 6650xt but haven't even bothered to download them
Agreed haha
If i find this I'm gonna be excited and pissed EDIT YOU ARE MY GODDAMN HERO HOLY SHIT
Thanks to a hero in previous comment got my games You are right dead island was fun at launch with friends Appeal die real quick to me
Dead island will be good dude what you smoking that game has seen more studios than my dick has seen action They should've included Redfall This reminds me someone made a post about Forspoken and the same type of promotion They only give away the bottom of the barrel nvm it was on r pcmr but still
There is a whole team behind that email He does not waste his time with customer support
Not ceo anymore
its actually the executive responce team and they have fixed a few issues when i had problems getting issue though the thick skulls of the normal CS
He s not like Gabe Newell who literally does answer his emails himself
that's the email for Jeff Bezos I really suspect it is not It's going to a team or an intern
Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon Yeah and bill CEO of M 't forget steve CEO of A
Jeff isn t CEO anymore
you have to choose the option Contact us in english and use the chat function when i used the mail they often replied in their native language but if u use the chat they answer in English and i had only good experienced with the chat very fast D
It is the nuclear option but an option that does exist if you ve exhausted other options
They can have a limited number of game codes as they are not the publisher of this game but even if they have codes they won't admit it because that's Amazon way of lies
Imo if you mark it for promotion it should be honored no matter what That or they should be fully accept refunds past date because some I'm sure buy based on that if they were eyeing two closely related products say like a 7900 non x doesn't have it but a 7900x does have a promotion listed
Was definitely sold by Amazon I always make sure to check my invoice has the seller Sold by A
They refunded the money in Amazon credits and I ended up letting my mom use it so I never got the game in the end
Correct Amazon in the USA
I got the codes after 1 1 2 months Support said it was not eligible when i was It worked itself out
oh I'd be on the horn with my payment processor immediately I'd have also told Amazon that as well in order to avoid that very situation they hate disputed transactions especially when they are documented to be in the wrong
Then contact AMD show em the reply from Amazon and I am sure they will sort it out
I stand corrected A lot of the time these kind of deals are excruciating to try and figure out and redeem
2nd who are you to say that you really bought 7950x
ooo i should be eligible as well i bought on feb 1 actually just checked edit I just talked with Amazon support and while chatting with them found the email with the game code in my email spam folder lol
Ahh okay that would make more sense lmao thank you
Yep purchased a 6900XT and got both my codes as soon as it shipped For all the crap Newegg gets my last purchases have been early and my returns promptly processed Amazon has been shady for me lately though Ordered a laptop and UPS website said it had not arrived They told me to wait 3 days then apply for refund I did they denied it I had to initiate a charge back claim and got the refund 2 weeks after not receiving the item Apparently they've grown too big to properly serve their customers
Have you redeemed it I ve read the full ToC but just curious how it played out Does it eventually show in the EA app as waiting for release Or is it something else The code you get is first redeemed on AMD then they verify the CPU install then do you get a second code redeemed through EA
its the amd store it wont cost amazon a dime
They charge the seller for returns even if shipped by amazon
Just return an old CPU Let amazon burn
Other people have received the code already from other vendors I ve gotten pre release codes from other promos weeks in advance of the game launch It adds the game to your library but doesn t download it til launch
I never heard back and ended up returning the 7950X and got a 7950X3D instead The X3D doesn t qualify for the promotion though oh well
Had the same issue in Canada back in November for the 5000 series Checkout page listed my order as valid and that it came with Bonus video game Code never arrived and Amazon did nothing Ended up getting a code directly from AMD rewards
Well all I can say is hassle them if no luck return and buy from a shop that will give the game code When I got my 3700X from amazon 4 years ago or so they sent the code via amazon PM or is it email had to look to find it GL
Did you order more than one
Even if it wasn't it shouldn't even matter if Amazon is listing the promo on the product they should be honoring it regardless of which seller they allowed on their platform
Yep the quality of google results drooped both on google and you tube now I think about it also amazon search is super bad to Dark patterns are everywhere bad results keep you on the site for longer so stats look bigger
Not trying to be overtly pedantic but Bing is owned by Microsoft a tech giant I would just stick with DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo went shitty too I stick with brave for my search engines now
Brave is definitely worth checking out too They've got their own search engine now too
bing wtf for and duck duck go is a joke its literally almost a carbon copy of the code used in incognito mode of chrome but much less secure
making intentionally bad products does well under capitalism i was told that literally cannot happen and has never happened before
Did you get both codes Just wondering because I never received the Dead Island 2 code
Is the activation after code validation tied to the cpu I m reading yoh can sell the code if it s through epic or steam via Amd
That means you get both games and the money too
hes not checking them from space in a rocket shaped like a
Yup I used to work for a major Amazon seller and we got results when we emailed them with issues their minimum wage Indian call center workers weren't qualified to even attempt to fix Granted those were major issues like an 800K container disappearing in a warehouse
Is that why we can't have half life 3 Gabe spends all his time answering random people's emails
Might want to take a look at Valves nonsense of the last 48 hours Gabe seems to be mia lately
And tim
You do realize Bill Gates no longer works at Microsoft and Steve Jobs is dead and therefore no longer the CEO of Apple right
well you're laughing but Gaben
still owns 10 of the stock though ie still has a horse in the race moreso than anyone else probably
I had the complete opposite experience Chat was always French only even if I said something in English they replied in French responding to that Email was also in French unless specifically requesting to be contacted in English but then they forgot after like the first response and they spoke French again They called me once from the UK where they spoke English and they were very nice
Indeed got the point from your previous comment I'm not even sure it would cost them anything to give a spare
In this case yes Honor the deal for the people who bought it inquired about it whilst removing it from the product page Stores mess up advertisements constantly this is how it should be done
I've had similar happen to me before and that's why I made my comment I hate when there's a promo like this and somehow the default seller ISNT Amazon like you'd think it would be Infuriating
Ah damn I d never played the original 3 on PS3 so the nostalgia was lost on me when I played Uncharted 4 but I still enjoyed it loads I only played it on PS4 but I d recommend to cop it on a sale if you re still interested to play it
If you want to play a Star Wars game reminiscent of Sekiro Souls style games it's pretty good The story is interesting too if you're into Star Wars I'm looking forward to the sequel which is why not getting the code would be upsetting
The Amazon customer service representative can see my order history they even referenced my order number that I blurred out Proving I bought it is not the issue
Did you buy on Amazon If so make sure it was sold by A re eligible I d open a ticket too
Amazon's support has been extremely dodgy the last few years Sometimes they're awesome with helping but other times they tell me they can't do anything I bought a brand new unopened WD Blue 6 TB drive opened the box and found a 2 TB inside Despite sending numerous pics of the unopened Amazon box the WD packaging including serial number and the unopened 2 TB drive they eventually sent me a return label It took 3 months to get my money back because they kept telling me I sent the wrong item and they want the original It's freaking annoying when the returns department can only be contacted by email not phone support and still deal with them sending the same copy and pasted message each time without a real response I've cut down using them for only certain things otherwise I just take a 45 min ride to Microcenter or even Best Buy in most cases to get something
lately no son Amazon had been shady as f ck for years now I would not spend major money on that site Oh yeah and then there are all the counterfeit products sold on Amazon all day long and they do nothing to protect their customers A so they choose to screw their customers I would never trust them with anything beyond tea or shampoo
I have redeemed it via AMD's website for such things It said it was awaiting full release but confirmed the free game Apparently when it releases I'll get a code key Not sure if the key will be redeemable on steam or whatever but it is certainly confirmed
shipped and sold by all the amd store means is they will show you AMD items
The seller is Amazon
illegal but ethical
Maybe Amazon is just slow since that's where I ordered my cpu from too If you don't get an e mail with the code by launch then I'd worry but either way if you contact the AMD rewards cust service like others recommended they should get you sorted pretty quickly
Dang thanks for the update I'm sorry you didn't get your promotion
Those arseholes are probably aware you won't want to go thru the hassle of returning Amazon Twitch are a joke these days
Yep the quality of google results drooped both on google and you tube It's not just me then Seriously for a little while now perfectly simple Google searches have been returning completely useless results where previously it would reliably just be whatever info I needed Thought I was just getting bad at googling
DDG had their own telemetry crap I use Startpage Gives google results but goes through their server first instead of you telling google what you're looking for
Duck duck is worse than Google
How did duckduckgo become shitty
Wow did some searching and yes Brave has there own Search engine At first I assumed they where link Duck Duck Go and using Bing cool that they have the own Ill have a go at a few and see what I like now I know brave is there own ill be sure to give it a go
Warning Brave uses Chromium If you like their search engine I would see if it s possible to use it on Firefox Firefox and TOR are the only web browsers that don t use Chromium
DDG uses Bing actually
AMD doesn t make bad products They re not all great but they don t currently sell any legitimately bad products
Intentionally making bad products might win short term but it is a losing strategy long term under capitalism A slightly more clever strategy is to make your products as cheaply as possible while still being high enough quality to reasonably satisfy the customer Reasonably satisfied in this case would be a customer willing to purchase the product again if the need arose This is a MUCH more successful strategy than simply making intentionally bad products This is actually filling a need in the market while others can fill other needs wants like good quality at a reasonable price and luxury goods
To be honest I knew I couldn't resell them so I didn't even bother registering for them
You only get the DI2 code in the release day April 21th
It s not released yet You ll get it when it s out
The way I understood it is that the game will only install on a PC which actually has the GPU installed You have to run a validation program or something
Yup Playing dodge simulator in callisto rn
Johnson space center can you send me all my emails while I'm up here There's no internet in this rocket shaped like a
I know you jest but i think that at this point it would be for the best that half life 3 never comes into existence why because no matter what Valve does it would never be able to live up the expectations this is a game that has been elevated to mythical levels of hopium
bro doesn t develop anymore
We got half life 3 the script was leaked years ago and some fans tweaked it to make it more palatable to read We know what happens Of course half life Alyx was fun
oh Christ
No mate I am oblivious to everything Did you read the post I replied to Just in case people aren t aware that s the email for Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon Jeff is literally not the CEO of Amazon although frequently confused as such and I replied with two people who are literally not the CEO of other companies although frequently confused as such
It would cost them almost nothing but Amazon gave up the customer happiness since they are dominant in online market now they just do whatever they want
I just hate that amazon doesn't have a straight up filter to show products shipped and sold by Amazon You can sort of get it to work by combining a few filters in the search But with so many ways to filter that option should be an easy one
yeah I just edited my last comment with an update I have my code thumbs up
I only buy from Amazon as a last resort now Best Buy is good but has a limited selection for PC components GPUs and CPUs are all there but motherboard RAM and SSD options are less certain Newegg tends to have everything Amazon does but they've had their own issues Microcenter sounds awesome but only if it's available Amazon I just don't even trust to send me what I order anymore due to the extent of their counterfeit similar issues Usually between Best buy and Newegg I can get what I want at the same price
Yea I'm actually surprised people haven't noticed how much shittier Amazons support has gotten over the last 3 years or so This was bound to happen as they became more dominant
I ve started using the Walmart site Amazon is priced better on computer parts but Walmart s response is always That s fine we ll send another even when it s a third party seller
I purchased a few years ago a GTX 1080 from Amazon when I received my order I had a box that said GTX 1080 but when I opened it it said in my system I had a opened packages can't be returned because of our policy apparently also after received a wrong product Even after I showed them numerous pictures that I was deceived because my box said it was a 1080 so of course I was gonna open it But apparently it's a failsafe scam to put a fake product in the originally ordered product box because once opened NO RETURNS
why would you have pics of the unopened amazon box
Not sure why all the hate with Amazon Sure this is a special cases Asides from missed packages in delivery I have never had any issues returning an item I am not even sure whey most of you guys on here are contacting support just to return an item I just use the app or website and initiate a return myself I never ever had them refused a return I have returned opened and slightly used products There is no such policy as no return on open items People who commented they don't trust Amazon probably got scammed by buying from 3rd party vendors I buy 99 percent of my items shipped and sold by Amazon Never had to contact support directly to return items and I have return a lot I ordered a 2TB m 2 ssd drive from Newegg recent and they sent it in a manila padded envelope through UPS and package came bent and dented
They usually suck me off but they re starting to be more conservative Also keep in mind they are rented out to the lowest bidder so these are most certainly underpaid employees
Surprisingly amazon India has gotten a lot better Seems like their focus is shifting from the United States to other parts of the world I've heard similar reports from my friends in Australia as well
I bough a AIO from them last correct
Received my CPU today from Amazon how long did it take for you to receive the info from Amazon to then redeem on AMD s site What is the validation process like Do you have to download a tool from AMD that checks the installed CPU vs the serial number you give them I believe I read in the terms and conditions the code you get is for Steam which would be amazing Thanks for the input I m just not sure when I will get this CPU installed I was planning on throwing it in a test bench with parts I have put aside for the 7800X3D when it launches but really was hoping I could use this promo to get the game and return the CPU afterwards
its drop shipped by amazon for AMD so the return go direct back to AMP amazon isnt buying them first
If wait til launch I ll be outside the return period I d rather get it resolved within that time frame
Amazon is not to bad for returns they let a few go past no problems each year What they do is flag users that return a lot and then start making it harder well that's how it used to be unless there's not been a big change But I do get you if the CPU is in the system then it's a pain to pull and clean etc
It seems to be a normal way to boost metrics for your website you make search less good to force users to spend more time on the site Helps management get a pay rise Also nice to know its not just me relay noticed Youtube searches pull up videos with no relation to the search I can jump from google but youtube is much more of a problem
It's not just you SEO industry has gamed the system thoroughly while Google keeps plowing in more ads on the right of the page This is why there's so much blog spam garbage and similar in the top results Google is going to be in big trouble if they keep this up simply because competitors have nothing to lose and everything to gain While Google has barely anything left to gain with 90 market share and everything to lose especially if competition loses they're going to have anti trust snipers gunning for them much more actively than they already are Especially with Bing going all ChatGTP supplemented now again with basically nothing to lose Google Search is in a panic at the offices I'd wager my life on it As an aside Amazon search has hit shovelware status especially since 3rd party sellers crossed the 50 of all site sales threshold a little while back It's shovelware as the search functionality itself is just inaccurate and it's shovelware since there is a flood of so many sellers selling the same garbage
neeva is honestly the best alternative to google but it's paid
They pretty much use the same backend censored engine as Bing and will give you the same censored or SEO optimized results as google I remember searching some weird niche Japanese raw manga at a time going trough 4 search engines till I found the one that gave me the result Want to guess what it was It was Yandex if I need to go to an Russian search engine to find something things are bad Sadly it seems to be consistent at this point if google does not find it no other western search engine will really do it either but Yandex will
They recently got caught selling user data
Great to know thank you
Warning Brave uses Chromium And If they strip out any potential telemetry stuff then where is the issue The whole reason why people don't want to use Chrome is that Google tracks everything and a lot of that tracking is integrated into the Chrome browser itself By starting with the Chromium codebase Brave gets all the benefits of Google's work on making a fast clean browser and all the Brave developers need to do is strip out any potential analytics and add in their own modifications to suit their needs
firefox is so ba dnow its like the old dead grandmother of the browser world
I never said literally all products made are bad
Alright No worries I ended up registering at amdrewards but its been saying that for like a month now
Thanks You're a really nice guy
Wang Pay attention I'm sorry teacher it was just that I saw this email thread on Reddit talking
Well documented dmca abuse by an irate fan has taken down Workers and Resources Devs have filed counter claim Valve was even warned ahead of time this was likely No response from valve but to pull the game no action whatsoever by Gabe
Best Buy is good but has a limited selection for PC components GPUs and CPUs are all there but motherboard RAM and SSD options are less certain i mentioned this in a Data Hoarder's sub but my local Besy But recently downsized and doesn't even have a fraction of the stock they used to Hardware components Good luck Our area's forced to go back to buying from online retailers or Amazon sadly
One thing from Amazon I noticed is the drop of quality in delivery never had a missed package for years until recently and it happened two times now maybe it's a new guy in my area that refused to contact me at the door but instead called my phone from a weird number I usually don't answer unknown numbers and let it go to voicemail while standing at the front door I live in a condo and I specified the unit number for him to push but he doesn't do it
Absolutely I try to use Amazon for non important stuff or if they're the only ones who have something that BB or MC don't carry While BB doesn't have the best selection which has gotten better over the years at least they're a good substitute if you're in a bind and need it right away MC is usually my first route option I'm within distance of two stores but both highways are a pain to travel with heavy construction they're undergoing I used Newegg frequently before they were bought out Still use them here and there but I avoid getting motherboards from them after that whole fiasco GN covered awhile back But they do still have good deals when you can catch them and their support has never given me much trouble either The reps on the phone were always helpful whenever I did need help with something Same goes for FRYS and TigerDirect both were within the same distance of MC for me so I had options if one of them didn't have what I needed
Living in Ireland Amazon is the only real choice we have since Brexit as most places in the UK won't ship to us here unless the main brands have a dedicated Irish online store But we do get to buy from other EU Amazon sites and can compare the prices with the
They haven t turned a profit yet They re trying to position themselves to be less dependent on AWS to stay afloat They ve been cutting costs and jacking up prices The sellers are paying 30 more cut to them now as well this year
How are they I might consider using them if they're that good with dealing with those issues
Sounds like you got scammed by a 3rd party seller
I've seen that scam too that's why I try to grab pictures or a video showing the box being opened Though after my HDD incident it feels like showing proof isn't good enough and put you through so many hoops in the hopes you just give up
I'm assuming they did so with the expectation that such pictures would've helped with exactly that type of situation
Because of the scams people pull on Amazon by buying and swamping out items and returning them There have been threads on here BAPCS PCMR etc of people buying new parts only to find the wrong item or something entirely different thrown into the box and returned only for it to be sold again as new on Amazon It's more of insurance to help fight Amazon refusing to refund you in the instance you buy something find out what you got wasn't what you ordered or was swapped and they refuse to issue a refund when they demand you send it back
Because these days people document the opening process so they don t get screwed
Oh yeah years ago it felt like anytime you'd call in for help they'd happily give out 10 credits or refunds over the phone Nowadays it feels like you're pulling teeth trying to explain the problem only to have the rep not understand what the issue is while reading off the same lines from their support book Usually the only way I can get good help is during the very early morning hours 5 7 AM or late night anytime after midnight and usually being connected with the Philippine support who actually try to go a bit further
Because of the scams people pull on Amazon by buying and swamping out items and returning them There have been threads on here BAPCS PCMR etc of people buying new parts only to find the wrong item or something entirely different thrown into the box and returned only for it to be sold again as new on Amazon Amazon Spain is terrible these days my friends and family back there avoid buying expensive stuff from amazon and film the
I wouldn't be surprised they have a good stronghold over most of the online market in the US Seems like a common thing companies do establish themselves with fantastic support once that's achieved move onto the next market while cutting back to ensure that hold They're getting aggressive with their online pharmacy over here I'm constantly receiving emails that I should move all my meds over to them because its cheaper
you are a moron it literally say's SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON right in the image that OP posted you need to actually learn how amazon works
also why would amazon have WAREHOUSES when you say they dropship its the 3rd party sellers on amazon that dropship not amazon themselves
oh fuck yea I remember that now I remember the news from 2021 july 'access denied' don't know what that is about
I actually agree with you yandex can be surprisingly good if none of the usual scumbags give the results you're looking for Though I have run into issues with yandex trying to force a specific region version that doesn't allow search settings to be saved but that's relatively minor and can be worked around Though I still don't trust it in regards to respecting privacy as much as duckduckgo
Wanna throw a link my way I know about the search with duckduckgo on Android leaking data to Microsoft thing and IIRC they're trying to get out of the contract that was a part of if that's what you're talking about Though I believe that didn't apply to using duckduckgo in a web browser just context menu selection quick search on Android which still isn't good admittedly
Brave is a bit shady with their marketing crypto integration ad replacements etc
Brave actually uses Ungoogled Chromium's patches as well
What are you talking about They are continually adding more features and it actually better than Chrome while using less system resources
Tell me you haven't used Firefox within the last 5 years without telling me
I asked about dead island a few days prior to release
I'd definitely believe that For what it's worth I have no idea how well stocked the retail locations are I just use them as an online store that doesn't co mingle inventory with various third parties
I want to like B H Photo but they have unreliable stock Anything that is throttled like GPUs may get listed and never fulfilled Happened to my on December 13th xtx launch Paid for my GPU and got refunded almost a month later with an apology email
I didn't want to mention them because I feared the chance of the conversation going off course but I'll just say I really don't want to support a privately owned company where the owners are part of a specific religious sub sect that has views on women's rights Women's role that I find extremely problematic For people that either don't care about that or just prefer to not take such considerations into account for purchases B H is probably a solid choice
Amazon Prime drivers have a pulse and a driver's license
It s really been very good so far I ve ordered at least a dozen or so times Two times I got an alert that the package had arrived when it hadn t Both times they immediately had the third party seller send another In both cases the first eventually arrived In one case the third party seller did want the extra RAM back but the other seller did not want the extra PSU back So I ve actually got a really nice spare EVGA 750w 80 Gold PSU
He s right they do that The listings are kind of sus compared to other sites but the customer service does eat most problems They don t even ask for the return most of the time and when they do it s similar to Amazon only you drop off at Walmart instead of ups
No shit but they should at least implement some sort of reassurance policy which would guarantee you either get your ordered product or your money returned 3rd party seller or not
no one takes pics of amazon boxes because 1 it doesn't prove anything it could be any box period also any box can be opened repackaged and resealed i do it all the time for returns and since i make very s nice clean neat slices open they close real easily also what would a box have to do with the code for the game
Holy shit the worse I've had is amazon accidently sending me the wrong colour of socks
That makes sense
Though I still don't trust it in regards to respecting privacy as much as duckduckgo TBH I dont trust any of them but I can bet money Yandex is tracking everything you do and reporting it to the Russian government but if you are not Russian and not using it for sensitive stuff there is not much for them to find
That s what I was talking about All the rest is ass covering
Thanks for letting me know
That s the issue though they ARENT responding to the point that their lack of procedure amounts to complicity It is pretty typical corporate but not some shining beacon of responsiveness and common sense either
The Best Buy in our area used to be well stocked except on CPUs and Motherboards and stuff They couldn't keep them in stock for long LOL I loved going in there to see what they had so I could pick it up locally and when I wanted Best buy does let 3rd parties sell on their site but you can normally filter to best buy only I highly prefer places that don't comingle inventories if possible makes thins easier
If you only discovered them after the pandemic the unreliable stock is more common since that kicked off Stories like yours still happened occasionally but they were the exception not the rule I think the cause of it is that I'm pretty sure their warehouse is their store in NYC When you buy something online from them they send someone to pick it from the shelves but you're still competing with walk ins as well

Interesting I haven't used Walmart all that much aside from a few small things like oil for my car Though that's pretty awesome they're able to step in and provide proper help against third parties I know returning stuff in store was always easy and they didn't really make the process difficult either
And that is probably the worst that will happen to you The worst I had was a broken 55 tv box was fine outside seemed maybe a bit crushed
Saw someone else claim the third party thing in a different conversation Conclusion was that it used to be true but they cancelled it maybe a year or two ago At least when I go there I only ever see options for stuff sold by them directly

I trust them with bedding curtains appliances home and car stuff mostly
Ouch that's gotta hurt Hopefully they replaced it free of charge
Maybe it was Cancelled in the US but is still active in Canada I saw third party sellers on their site just the other day
They did bit from the conversation I could tell the qgen thought I had broken it
Huh I just checked their Canadian website and that is the case That's such a weird thing to do different between US and Canada For once I'm glad I'm getting the American version instead of the Canadian version of something
What the fuck I don't understand why they'd do that like be consistent
I think this is a new chart Let me know if it's old news
This makes it clear that the 7900 XT is a full tier down from the XTX and there's no point in saving 10 in price when you lose 20 in performance
RX 7900XTX performance increase to RX 6950XT RE Village 53 COD MW 2 51 CP2077 67 WD Legion 47
Can we speculate that the 7800xt will be only as good as a 6950xt if not worse Then it is time to get 515 6800xt No need to wait any more
At the rate we are going my guess is the 7800 XT will give you 6950 XT performance BUT at a much reduced power draw compared to the 6950 XT and 7900 class And will probably be priced at 700
If I see strong post release review numbers for performance I m buying an 7900XTX for sure But this graph shows pretty decisively that the 7900XT needs to be cheaper than it is to make it in any way worth buying instead of the XTX
Sooo can we get a nice 100 dollar price reduction on the xt please
7900XT should be 800 AMD is using the classic upselling strategy
So the 7900 XT would be 29 6 faster than a 6950 XT and the 7900 XTX would be 54 7 faster than a 6950 XT and 19 4 faster than the XT model That would put the XTX kind of close to the 4090 in raster only 6 advantage for the Nvidia card and the XT around 15 faster than the 3090 Ti according to Techpowerup results It depends on how cherrypicked these numbers are of course Edit I forgot TPU used a 5800X for their review Using the meta review the 4090 would be 13 14 faster than an XTX geforce rtx 4090 meta review
Everyone jumped on the XTX being value forgetting the crappy price bump of the 6800 XT's replacement of literally 250 But it's easy to do so when you look at the abominations called RTX 4080 12GB 16GB Remember names mean nothing it's all about the specs from a generational comparison point of view and if you look at them 7900 XT is even more castrated than 6800 XT was compared to the flagship counterpart AMD pulled off a much more elegant less outrageous 4080 12GB with the XT and XTX conventions
Like the 6800 non XT this GPU will hardly sell and no one would buy it and rightly so at it's price point Fortunately AMD will probably drop it's price sooner or later
So my guesswork 4080 and 7900 XT will have around the same performance looking at nvidia's and amd's slides and 7900 XTX will be in between 4080 and 4090 Hypothetical 4085 so to speak AMD undercuts with 7900 XT by 300 dollars 1200 to 900 and undercuts with 7900 XTX by 400 dollars Average between 4090 and 4080 is 1400 and AMD is 1000
Ngl my 540 6800xt feeling really good right now I m gonna need to start saving now for my next gpu upgrade cause next year we aren t going under 1000 at all
Sheesh The XT is shaping up to be AMD's 4080 12GB I guess it only exists to sell the XTX
Huh ngl the 7900xt looks kind of mid compared to the 6950xt It's definitely an improvement but I was kinda expecting more The 7900xtx definitely offers a lot more though
People need to understand that the 7900 XT is in the same spot that the 6800 XT was for RDNA 2 AMD has effectively pushed up every model one tier in the product stack for pricing compared to RDNA 2 So we need to treat the 7900 XTX as the 7900 XT and the 7900 XT as the 7800 XT in terms of price to performance They are pulling the wool over the consumer's eyes and changing the pricing right in front of our eyes without most people noticing Why aren't the influencers calling them out on this AMD has cut costs through using chiplet design and raised prices by bumping every tier up one on the product stack this generation and they need to be called out like Nvidia is being called out right now
Quick math Geomean of 7900XT results puts it at 29 faster than the 6950XT
If these charts are to be believed there s no way the 7700xt will beat the 6950xt like some were saying initially I bet even the 7800xt will at best be on par with the 6950xt which is still great depending on the price it s released at
Why not just call them 7800 XT and 7900 XT And leave room for a XTX or 7950 XT which uses dual GPU dies
Oof so the 7900XT exists to upsell the 7900XTX To me if these cards are 4080 competitors they should be the 7800XT and 7800 XTX at those respective prices The 6900XT competed with the 3090 so if the 7900XTX doesn't compete with the 4090 then the pricing and naming is just wrong
Cyberpunk hits exactly 60 fps Hmmm have a feeling there might be some fudging going on there
the yields must be so good they don't want anyone to buy the cut down die lol
Man AMD why are you marketing a X800XT card as X900XT after the fake 4080 12Gb disaster I'm disappointed
If the 7800xt is 6950xt levels there will be chaos
NVIDIA and AMD pricing this generation SUCKS Price your halo flagship cards at whatever but making them so fast it makes everything else close to the flagship look like bad value is not it
So that's confirms thar the AMD's X800s and NVIDIA's XX80 are now mid end GPUS with high end prices
This generation is a disaster Both GPUs need to lose at least 200 to somewhat justify a new generation
looks like theyre using the same tactics as nvidia theres a pretty good bump in performance going from the 7900xt to 7900xtx why spend 900 on the xt when you can spend only 100 more for the xtx
I wonder how this graph would look if ray tracing was turned on
You can kind of tell that AMD wants you to buy the XTX
amd is trying to sell 7900xtx and blame nvidia for price hikes grinning face with smiling eyes
Should be 18 faster than the 4080 and 9 9 slower than the 4090 based on Hardware Unboxed 4k 13 game geomean
This card 7900XT is going to be extremely irrelevant as soon as the 7800 XT drops If the performance aren't far behind and the price is lower than 700 than it has no reason to exist Either get a 7900XTX or the 7800 XT Unfortunately the 7900XTX rivals the 4080 16GB and the 7900 XT rivals the 4070 Ti model making the 7800 XT probably only 4070 competitor compared to last year's 3080 competition at 670 MSRP
7900xt should have been 7800xt and 7900xtx should have been 7900xt Nvidia type move from AMD
This just in AMD engages in the same shitty upselling that Nvidia does by making the 7900XT look like a bad value as incentive to buy into the more expensive XTX tier More at 11
thinking face did the PC gaming world switch to 4k gaming already
Is the FPS count shown with or without FSR So in comparison for Cyberpunk on a 4090 4K without DLSS is at 43 58 FPS With DLSS 3 0 It's hitting 113
Coming soon RX 7900 XTXTXTX
Looks like die production is going much better than they thought So keep the lower card priced higher to make the top end card look like a better deal
So is the 7900XT just 7900XTX's that didn't make the cut
Wouldn't this mean that the 6900xt is still the bang for the buck for wqhd at least since it costs below 700 often around 650 in Germany right now and the 7900xtx will propably be at least 1200 for the base model 50 60 performance uplift for 70 increased price
I can't fathom how people in the comments find it easy to spend 1000 Dollars on just a graphics card That's over two months worth of rents
Borderlands 3 15FPS
In my opinion if those numbers are valid AMD want to jab on RTX 4080 But im concern how will they price Navi 32 It will probably end with Navi21 performance and just a little better RT Yet current pricing of Navi 31 just puches any potential Navi 32 in 500 700 range which is Navi 21 teritory I think Navi 32 could be AMDs RTX 4080 kind of failure The question is how valid are those numbers MLiD just said AMD is still valdating final clocks and if AMD isn t sandbagging to much or is concerned nVidia could lover the price of 4080
4k Max Settings Up To WTF is that even supposed to mean If Up To were 1st it'd kind of make sense but it makes no sense at the end like that
I'm a little confused how a 15 20 performance gap only gets a 10 price cut The cache dies must add some significant cost
So the 7900xt is only 20 ish faster than the I have a feeling the 7900xt might go down in price by 100 200 in the not too distant future or the 7800xt is 90 of the way fingers crossed anyways
This is insanely good XTX is 90 of 4090 in rasterization performance Of course will lose badly in ray tracing DLSS is half a tier better than FSR still due to adaptation
6950 can only play Cyberpunk at 43fps is this right
Looks like the not a 4090 competitor lands 10 behind it in raster at least in CP77 WD Legion Will be nice if it gets confirmed I guess this warning was to cater to the but RT perfs crowd The 7900XT as announced is still a head scratcher though
I hate how prices have become normalized in the GPU space And now upselling GPU's is becoming normalized to Sadly this can only get worse because people will buy them no matter what
I wanted to save for xtx 7900 but im scared of taxation and vendor increasing even more prices
I was like 139fps that's wack Then saw 4k Holy shit Hats off to you AMD Should see the 9950xt in my next build while this 3080 skeet skeets these frames out like rick James on a bender
Up To I don't like the sound of this Maximum FPS is very unreliable
Thanks to nvida that 1000 seems as a bargain As the pricing goes the cards could have been 50 to 100 cheaper given the current prices of the new cards Amd is hoping that the budget section jumps on the XT and the rest of the market goes after the xtx face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy Hopefully one day people speak with their wallets and not social media protest
This reminds me of the classic X non X differences in Zen 2 Get a 7900 XT if you want to toy with its voltages and overclock it a bit maybe even enough to get it to near XTX performance Get an XTX if you don't
So they've confirmed that the numbers are raster can the idiots stop claiming that it's fsr numbers now
I don't know how to feel about it numbers look more or less around the 4090 performance maybe a bit slower and I hate how it is Up to and not average fps
New chart old data says nothing more than the numbers they showed on reveal
Cant wait for the 7600xt that will be more expensive and worse vs the 6600xt with 4 pcie lanes also Its a tradition in the budget midrange class of gpus for a few generations Not even talking about the 500xt class of gpus That will probably be something truly outrageous
Everyone talking about the specs and which is better while my biggest concerns are the temps and availability 999 price tag doesn t mean anything if it s sold out instantly for months and resold for the same price as 4090 msrp
Nvidia simply owns at ray tracing If you want RT throw away your AMD card and get Nvidia That being said if you are like me then you quickly realize that most games do in fact neither support ray tracing nor does ray tracing look always amazing And if you are one do the crazy high FPS of gamers ray tracing isn t attractive anyhow
Very disappointing
Upto numbers and not AVG i mean no benchmarkers use that metric for anything
IMO this chart isn't bragging at all its actually really sad I miss the days of REAL performance differences from one gen to another back in the 90's and early 2000's
Says Max Settings but ray tracing is obviously disabled so it isn t really max settings
Up to As in max framerate for just a moment ThisIsWorthlessM
The 7900 XTX is a million dollars however
It's actually quite close to what LTT speculated so not that far from 4090 at least in these selected titles The 7900 XT numbers are disappointing though
Without FSR If so the XTX trades blows with the 4090 if no ray tracing used Can't wait to see full benchmarks for these Could be the next GPU buy after the price abomination of 4090
This new gen is so disappointing from both sides Performance wise the gains are great but the pricing just kills the hype I dont have any problem with the 7900XTX because it matches the MSRP of the 6900XT while delivering 70 performance probably close to 2x in RT But the 7900XT should be the affordable high end card like the 6800XT was for 700 tops This essentially means AMD is really only launching one new high end gpu and relying on last gen to carry the rest of the line up which is no different from Nvidia As someone who is still on a 5 year old 1070 Ti and looking to upgrade to 4K I feel like theres just no winning especially as an european Nvidia cards are all still above MSRP and AMD while much better value overall locks you out of RT DLSS Best thing to do is probably to just grab the cheapest 6800XT I can find on black friday and put up with the fact I wont be able to use RT for a few more years
Jesus this is didisappointing These don't seem to line up with the previous 1 5 1 7x increase And the 7900xt seems to fall shorter of the xtx than I expected
So this doesn't count Ray Tracing
up to avg and 99 are the valuable numbers max frame rate while staring at the sky isint valuable info
Please re release 7900XT as 7800XT and at 650 It's so obvious what AMD are doing here The performance difference is big enough for it to be on a lower tier Looks like I'm definitely sticking with what I currently have which was already the plan anyway but now I have no temptation at all unless the prices drop significantly
Wow disappointing as fuck Glad I didn't wait
The next slide is with the RTX performance figures and it shows RDNA 3 is performing probably a full generation behind NVIDIA without FSR enabled x200B The RTX 4090 DLSS 3 does 4K at over 100fps in Cyberpunk RDNA3 FSR manages about 60fps at 4K So I think you get what you pay for with AMD it isn't a great deal in terms of fps
The 7900XT is more cut down vs the 7900XTX than the 6800XT was vs the 6900XT The 7900XT is really what should have been named the 7800XT Dick move but an expected one
Interesting the chart days up to for the fps Why not show the average The average is all that matters
So 7900xt is masked 7800xt
Yeah I think I'd stick to the 4080
i love how i get downvoted to oblivion for pointing out that the XT and XTX are entirely different tiers of cards used as a marketing strategy to sell more flagships yet here we but because it's not a 4090 AMD gets another free pass from the fanboys
In good old days this wouldnt cost more than 500 its fucking Nvidia who made this huge gap in pricing that made this Gpu cost around twice as much So we are all fucked and have to swallow it down unfortunately
Up to lol My 750ti gets up to 1000 fps
Up to Is this a joke And you guys are buying this all up I'd be very concerned if I was planning on buying a 7900 series card
Graph says up to in brackets so is it the max fps they get If yes then these graphs are super misleading
Up to This information is essentially worthless
So 7900 XT gets worse framerate in cyberpunk with RT off compared to 4080 12gb with RT
Up to These are max fps not average
So they basically re released the same charts they showed during the presentation Lol
without using FSR
7000 series are compatible with am4 right
We're these true even once No
Can someone please redo this chart and add the RTX 4090 I'm dead serious I actually plan on buying the RX 7900 XTX but I would at least like to know how close in performance the two are Thanks in advance
Fsr on
Up to
Up to is such a useless metric can't wait for some independent reviews My Steam Deck can manage Up to 100 frames in some games if I find a corner of the map and stare at the wall
can someone buy me 7900XT or XTX
I m super interested in this but I keep hearing how bad AMD drivers are I don t wanna spend forever fighting with it
Up to That is basically worthless
Good God y'all Y'all bitching about pricing when you should be bitching about this graph No one cares about max fps We need averages not the max that appears when there's hardly a thing to render
Up to is annoying I'll wait for some legitimate benchmarks
I guess I would be fine with a RX 7600
Any speculation on why the 7900 xt clocks slower than the xtx Usually the lower core counts get compensated with higher boost clocks which would normally keep the bigger and smaller die closer Does the xtx need perfect silicon
I expect the performance difference at lower resolutions to be much reduced RDNA2 falls off at higher resolutions RDNA3 is paired with more raw bandwidth allowing better scaling at higher resolution So the gains may be 30 at 1080p 50 at 1440p
i'm tired of waiting let me buy this now ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Is this without using fsr
Hey why does the 4090 get 55 60fps in 4k cyberpunk max no raytracing I really doubt the 7900xtx will be better let alone significantly
There is another slide as well comparing ray tracing performance So the RX 7900 xt is on average around 30 faster in Raster compared to the 6950XT A decent gen on gen uplift but 7900XTX is priced too closely Will be a great card for around 749 dollars
Forgot about watch dogs
Hell of an upgrade from my 2080 super
It's crazy but its looking like the best ''value'' this generation is going to be the top end card for both AMD and Nvidia
I'm a 1080p gamer lol future proofed
Where is endnote RX 839
They should reveal the jebait and put the XT MSRP at 799 or 849 at most So far the XT MSRP only exists to sell more XTXs
I'm curious does anyone know when the embargo lifts for third party reviews
The XT will stay at it's price until A More of the midrange from AMD and Nvidia shape out leading to pricing pressure or B AMD sells out of rdna2 back log Some people are fr out here thinking AMD are just gonna go ohh yeah here's a 6 700 card that out performs our current 6 700 card we will just throw those in the bin and eat the cost for you our loving fans who buy Nvidias over priced shit regardless Smile
What's the sidenote say Is this with fsr
weird results x200B Their 6950XT is higher than tpu in CP WD and lower in RE8
7900 XTX looks like it will be my new card Hopefully I can grab a Sapphire Pulse or Nitro for a decent price The reference card looks sexy but I do want that Sapphire customer service
I'm more interested in how the 6950XT does against whatever they label the 7800XT if it continues the 650 price point I have a feeling the 7900XT is what should have been the 7800XT though
My 5700XT can finally retire 1440p is going to play amazingly
Who here is going green to red
ELI5 What is rasterization
Back Down Down X F A T A L I T Y Well played AMD well played
I might go for the xtx and upgrade from my 5700xt idk yet would that be possible on x570 boards Might go for an upgrade with that and rock out with my 5800
the question is should i upgrade to the 7900xt or should i just wait till the prices drop
I WANT PRODUCTIVITY BENCHMARKS
Can t wait to see YouTuber do a price vs performance chart on the 7900XT and 4080 16GB Lol
Question for anybody able to answer how many games are able to utilize ray tracing with AMD cards Is it something the devs need to enable or can RTX supported games run with ray tracing on AMD Coming from Nvidia but I'd like to pick up a 7900XTX because of Nvidia's crack pricing and cable melting lol
So the 7900xt is like the illusion of choice
Why is watchdogs still being used as a performance metric
These cards will be great for people who don't have 6000 3000 series cards
7900 XT probably should've been about 200 less At the very least 100
Will def be waiting for 7950xtx I think
Here's hoping for the 7800 XT to match 6950 XT in rasterization and at least 50 faster in RT at 700
The best joke is AMD posted real data while a supposedly chinese leaker posted 4080 16GB data portraying it faster on average by 20 than 3090Ti which is NOT going to happen in the most wet dreams you could possibly imagine Not unless RTX4090 is seriously bottlenecked at 4K or that leaked 4080 16GB has significantly higher clocks than any of the RTX4090 cards
Meanwhile I'm just patiently waiting for the 7700 haha
Everyone wants their own 4080 12 GB
It may finally be time to upgrade from my gtx1080
These graphs are unusually straightforward No obviously design decisions heavily emphasizing the performance deltas
Watch Dogs LeL
On the positive side this shows that the architecture seems to scale very well The XTX only has 14 more cores 20 more bandwidth and 20 more cache But it clearly performs about 20 faster too Meaning that AMD could probably get a lot more performance simply by making the GPU bigger which they can thanks to the chiplet design
Impressive Very nice Now let's see the Red Dead Redemption 2 numbers
Hmmm I don't think I have the PSU for the 7900 XTX so I might consider the 7900 XT even though it's more like a successor to the 6800 XT than the 6900 XT Will I REALLY need it if I want to do 1440p at high refresh rate though Would a 7800 XT be fine
How do we know these numbers aren't without using FSR
TechPowerUp 4K comparisons I added the Radeon RT 6950 XT as the baseline since their results for that card vary which likely comes down to nuances in system configuration e g CPU memory etc Then I scaled the results with a percentage gain based on the percentage performance difference in AMD s testbed The resulting projections are what you see as a good ballpark estimate of where the RT 7900 series cards should land As expected the RT 7900 XTX comes close roughly within 10 15 shy of the RTX 4090 but it is in no terms an RTX 4090 killer full stop Resident Evil Village RT 6950 XT 133 fps RTX 4090 235 fps RT 7900 XT projected on TechPowerUp testbed 157 124 133 168 fps RT 7900 XTX projected on TechPowerUp testbed 190 124 133 204 fps Cyberpunk 2077 RT 6950 XT 39 fps RTX 4090 71 fps RT 7900 XT projected on TechPowerUp testbed 60 43 39 54 fps RT 7900 XTX projected on TechPowerUp testbed 72 43 39 65 fps Watch Dog Legion RT 6950 XT 64 fps RTX 4090 105 fps RT 7900 XT projected on TechPowerUp testbed 85 68 64 80 fps RT 7900 XTX projected on TechPowerUp testbed 100 68 64 94 fps
I saw this picture on the day of reveal Old news
I really hope they will be available in Canada Right now I can t find what I want
7900xt and whatever 7800 7700 will be compared to last generation and likely pricing doesn't look very good here
Will this handle OSRS
My 3060 ti ultra gets 76 f cyberpunk
If I was doing NNN I'd lose here
HUB's 6950XT video shows Watch Dogs Legion 4k at 88 FPS average
20 fps in native 4K RT does not sound too promising In RT it is barely a competitor for 3090 Ti unfortunately I thought about XTX for a second before I've seen their RT results
My gut say you can definitely overclock this to reach XTX performance Unlike 4080 12GB 4070 Ti
Amd only showing length of the 7900xt xtx Can someone please tell the width height please Thanks
so is the 4080 16gb doa
this is without raytracing on why amd so scared to turn it on if they say RT improved a lot
I'm getting average of mid 90s 4k max on my 4090 in cyberpunk so not sad about not waiting for the team red offerings Solid numbers for sure though especially considering the price
Look what additional X gives to FPS
7900XT is even slower vs 7900XTX than 6800XT was vs 6900XT 7900XT dont deserve 7900 name It should be 7800XT and cost 650usd MAX
I really can't wait to be playing Dwarf Fortress on one of these monsters
Yea idk what the numbers mean but I m going for the 7900 next month and I m hype
Eh Guess I'll stick to my 6900XT All things considered this isn't that impressive of a jump
So what's the contents of Endnote RX 839 I wonder We don't know how raw these numbers are Also according to PCPartsPicker c 524 sort price page 1 the 6950XT is currently a 760USD card so that 7900XT better be a good step faster
Yeeeeah take these with a big lump of salt No word on FSR and RT At a guess Cyberpunk is 4k ultra with FSR on and zero RT
I will be waiting for the 7950XTXTXTX thanks
This is great Thank you for sharing
Pretty sure these cards will sell out in seconds and wind up on Ebay for twice the price lol
Can someone add the 4080 and 4090 numbers to this chart I'm too lazy to do the search myself D Also are the numbers with FSR or without Later edit looks like even XT is in rasterization around 4080 While 30 cheaper Hmmmm
rough estimation of 7900tx 7900XTX vs 4080 4090
What's up with the performance creep 7900XTX should've been 83 fps by their launch slides in C2077 Also Techspot RX 6900XT 48 fps RTX 3090Ti review RX 6900XT 42 fps RTX 4090 review RX 6900XT 45 fps RTX 4080 review RX 6900XT 45 fps There's something wrong with the numbers on this slide and in
Based on these values I think the 7800xt is gonna be the direct replacement of the 6950xt but way more efficient and better ray tracing and will most likely match the 3090 ti at 4k in terms of rasterization Itll be better value than both the 6950xt and 3090 ti at current low market price IT SURE AS HELL WILL BE BETTER VALUE THAN THE 4080 I hope they bring that name back itd be funny will most likely be similar to the 4090 in performance but will beat it in amd sponsored titles with pure raster and probably cost 300 less at 1299 I am happy that they are keeping the cards smallish I noticed with my 4090 that it literally could be cooled by a 2 5 slot cooler and still stay relatively cool These big ass coolers they use are dumb and not needed Like damn the only super hot thing in my case is the 5800x3d if anything that needs a big cooler just to be cooled properly haah
You guys think the xt would pair ok with a i9900k
that was clear when you looked at the specs it confirms it tho it's gimped af and only exists to upsell the XTX
Well it's more like 15 18 less performance but at least the option is there if someone wants to save a 100 The reality is these probably won't sell at exactly MSRP so it might still balance out depending on the finale sale prices
AMD doing Nvidia tactic Make 7900xtx 4090 look like the better value option compared to 7900xt and 4080 Potato potato
This also makes clear there is still much room to scale with both clock and CUs paving the way for 3 or 4nm multi GCD designs next generation I had really hope RT would get some more love because this the third generation of support and it's not going to be trivial going forward nVidia has a major card to play and they will be paying developers to make RT a killer feature in every AAA title moving forward This weakness will be grossly exploited I am thinking Last gen it wasn't as big of a deal because even nVidia took an unreasonable performance hit with RT on That isn't the case this round
It's 16 slower For 10 less money
I wish AMD could price the 7900 XT accordingly 899 is still too steep I think this was supposed to be originally the 7800 XT I feel the proper price for the 7900 XT should be between 650 to 750 tops
I think that was the intended purpose of the card It exists for the reason to make 7900xtx look great
Seems like this is the new gen selling tactic Honestly unpopular opinion but with new consoles being so good in terms of you barely need anymore graphical fidelity anymore now and it's only 500 gaming PCs are becoming more of an enthusiast tier thing more than ever
yeah this might push me to just wait for 7800XT or reconsider my options I don't like such marketing selling bullshit
The XTX is over the 300w TDP standard though
It should ve been 899 and 759
Should have been the 7800XT the only purpose of it is to make the 7900XTX looks good value nvidia bonkers prices made people totally lose grasp of what is acceptable and AMD is just exploiting that
Yeah It's the same bullshit Nvidia pulled with their 2 4080s The 7900 XT should have been called 7800 I think the only reason people aren't that mad is the low price for both cards compared to the new Nvidia cards
Up to 20 D
yep should be lower price to really consider it With that pricing even if availability will be issue we will wait instead of buying XT
Size and wattage Price per watt is probably the same
either they should have called it the 7800xt at 700 800 either way this seems like Nvidia and AMD have found a new upselling tactic for this gen though AMD at a lower price point and Nvidia at a higher price point
The 7900xt is obviously there just to make you think it's only 100 bucks more at this point might as well
It may only make sense since the XT has a much higher OC potential However given the past few generations track record I'm pretty sure OC is locked limited so you might not go past 15 extra clocks which puts it barely on par with the reference clocks for a 7900XTX
It's the chip that was supposed to be 6800 XT imo
My guess is that the yields are good and they don't have very many of them relative to the XFX Sort of like the 6800 vs 6800 XT
Wait for 3rd party reviews Most of this segmentation may have been achieved via clocks and pwr limit Wouldn't be the first time
For just 100 more the XTX is just too tempting Even if that meant 1300 In that case the XT will be 100 behind
There's no point for the 900 price tag other than leaving room for old RDNA 2 stock to be sold off Once that happens and Navi 32 cards begin to be released I'd expect the 7900 XT to drop in price
Its like the 4080 12GB except price is still decent
upsell
Yeah wtf Same situation as the 4090 4080 WHY are the more expensive cards the better value Stop upselling please
Just when I thought I could
4080 12GB moment
So it s kinda like how the 6800 to the xt Just got for the xtx and be done with it
The 7900XT should be the 7800XT Simple as that
It s first party numbers That s why they re so cleanly spread No way that s how it pans out real world
Probably gonna have low supply for 7900 XT outside of launch day just like they did with the 6800 non XT
Isn't it obvious whats going on Full Navi 21 80 CU 6900xt 1000 Cut Navi 21 72 CU 8 less 90 of full 6800xt 699 x200B Full Navi 31 96 CU 7900xtx should be 7900xt 1000 Cut Navi 31 84 12 less 87 5 of full 7900xt 900 x200B They are selling the 7800xt as the 7900xt with a 200 markup but due to naming it looks the 7900xt got a 100 reduction
It was the same with the 6800 6800XT However in certain regions it was pretty much impossible to buy the XT until april may 2021
This is what I calls the Cinema Popcorn Effect
It's funny that if they had made the 7900 XTX 200 more expensive you would have been less upset about it
That might be true of the US MSRP pricing but by the time it reaches places outside the US there can be a lot more variability For example one UK retailer has the 6950 XT going for less than many of their 6900 XT models and 6800 XTs for less than 6800s If the 7900 XTX is that popular it may well go for upwards of 1500USD and make the XT model look like a good deal
As expected The XTX is the obvious card to get even over the 4080 still need reviews but right now it s better I likely will get the XTX and power limit it to 250w
unless they lock down the OC clock range comically 7900XT should only be down by the share of silicon cut out But yeah at stock it looks like an upsell and defect die saver plus one MCD
I am honestly more excited for the 7700XT the jump and better drivers between the 5700 XT and 6700 XT was quite nice
Geomean 1 545x 335W 6950XT performance Fyi in the footnotes AMD also clarified that at 300W the 7900XTX was 54 faster than the 6900XT
So the 1 5x upgrade probably holds water
I feel like RDNA3's emphasis on 4k and 8k is because they almost doubled the memory bandwidth with the 7900 XTX RDNA2 was notorious for falling behind at higher resolutions I'm guessing the improvements at 1440p will be much less impressive
Price compared to cheapest 6950XT on PCPartsPicker c 524 sort price page 1 32 Doesn't exactly feel like a generational shift in value
This was what I bet on after I saw the 4090 and 4080s pricing perf AMD wasn't gonna just give up the entire market but I felt like there was no way we were getting anything reasonably priced after I saw those Jumped on a 550 6800XT a month ago and have been very happy
This was pretty obvious from the moment the XTX performance was announced I'm pretty sure RDNA2 already offers similar value to RDNA3 on the lower end stack with the current discounted prices applied
It should be like 80CU's which will make it a direct comparison to the 6900XT Would make for a very interesting comparison from an architecture perspective I really hope it doesn't go above 600 700 I thought the Xt had 88 CU's so scratch that It's goona be like 72 76 CU's instead
There is still a big gap between the 6950 XT and the 790XT I think the 7800XT will be in the middle around 15 20 faster than the 6950XT
Yes Judging by the ALU count a full navi32 will have 63 performance of 7900xtx The 6950xt has 65 in this graph Maybe full navi32 will be clocked a little bit higher than navi31 but it won't change much
I think people forget that RDNA 3 is going to bring an RT performance uplift over the previous architecture If they are similar in raster performance and price but the 7800 gives 40 50 better rt performance then it's a no brainer Honestly I am looking for an upgrade to my 1070 and the only reason I haven't gone for a 6800xt is the abysmal rt performance compared to nvidia
Probably not as slow as a 6950 XT but not much faster than it The 7800 XT will just render the 7900 XT at 900 as a joke as long as it's 750
That's why I'm waiting for holiday season to see if they further discounts a little bit more They're desperate to get rid of RDNA2 Ampere stock
515 Man go on r hardwareswap and there's people selling 6800 xt's for 425
I think both companies will cut down prices on new gen once their overstock of the previous gen is finally gone These prices seem temporary just to keep selling their previous gen without losing on it Because I don't see either gen selling very well at these prices Price performance actually went down for new gen instead of up which is absurd especially the ridiculous 4080 This aint the covid crypto boom market anymore and nvidia amd will have to accept that eventually
I think 7800XT will be closer to the 7900XT than the 7900XT is to the XTX Can easily see it be around 15 20 faster than the 6950XT and then AMD can just make the bare minimum 7900XTs
Now that we know AMD followed nVidia's Ampere model of having dual function ALU's that can be either FP32 or INT32 in a particular 32 wide batch we can make some safer assumptions Assume the 7800 XT is a full Navi 32 which has 3840 stream processors and 7680 total FP32 ALU's Based on the limited performance information available it looks like AMD's extra FP32 capacity is used at roughly the same rate as nVidia's at 4K So divide the number of FP32 ALU's by 1 6 to get the effective shader count which is 4800 for this hypothetical 7800 XT To match the 6950 XT it needs to run at about 2 5 2 6GHz which seems likely It may be faster or slower depending on actual shader scaling and actual clock speeds but I think it's a safe bet that it will be pretty close
AV1 encoder is a huge deal if you want to make use of that functionality I kinda did but midrange next gen is months and months away likely
Depends if the 7800xt is a further cut down 72 cu navi31 or just a 60 cu navi32 I guess I'd be curious if another n31 based card would be 320 bit as well or 256 bit I'd say a 72 cu card would still be like 10 faster plus have more OC headroom and hopefully better RT performance but that doesn't look promising
I will probably wait until someone is dumping a 6950xt for cheap and snap that up Nice little upgrade on my 6800xt Then i will get the water block for it
I mean it only makes sense 4080 is only 15 faster than a 3090ti and a 7800xt will probably cost half
the 7900xt here should be the 7800XT imo and rename the 7900XTX to 7900XT
where are you seeing 515 6800xt i've been checking amazon everyday and all of the 6800xt is 670 out of stock and these are 3rd party scalpers if i saw the 6800xt for 515 i would have directly snatch it man thats a steal
Yeah sounds about right It'll match the last gen high end card while coming in at a cheaper price
But will it be on N32 a 60 CU chip Or will they further cut N31 just to compete with an X070 chip in limited quantities like they did with the 6800
And Best RT performance
I mean if the trend holds the equivalent gpus are 54 faster than their last gen counterpart so I wouldn't be surprised if the 7800 XT is 54 faster than the 6800 XT
they don't want to sell the XT
I think I'll wait for the XTXTXXTXTXXXX
finally seeing this post just because nvidia sell 4090 for 1600 not justified for amd to sell 7900xt for 900 it is just insane that it cost that much should be around 700 or even less
The 7900XT should be called 7800XT and sold for 700 bucks AMD is basically pulling a soft nvidia with shofting the names and prices around
If you could walk that back that'd be great Really think about what 800
7900XT is actually a 7800XT So the price should be 700 compared to 6800XT at 650
that's pretty close to what I expect of course AMD is using their best results here so I expect the 4090 to lead by about 15 20 on average in raster and be closer to 2x in rt in a wide suite of games
People already ignored the 350 price jump between the 6800XT and the 6900XT which amounts to like 5 gaming performance
They're the least egregiously bad options out there Win win
That s the low bar Nvidia presented due to their pride and greed AMD just had to meet it Smh
The 6800xt's successore is the 7900xt tho navi 1 xt die
Most of the XTX being value comments were based on the fact of people assuming based on nothing that the RX 7900 XTX was a RTX 4090 competitor
If you look at it from a CU perspective the 7900xt still has more CUs than the 6900xt so technically that could be the naming scheme But they should still have given it a price appropriate for performance not raw specs
If we base flagships equivalent of 3090 4090 then 7900XTX is less competitive than the 999 6090XT was as at least it was trading blows in rasterization while 4090 looks untouchable right now Makes the 4080 look bad naming wise remains to be seen where it places itself against the 7900XTX If it ever trade blows in rasterization then it s more like a 3080 Ti situation but somehow on a much more cut back silicon than ampere was and would put some serious doubt on AMD s flagship If a 4080 is price gauging then wouldn t that put the 7900XTX more like a 6800XT equivalent and thus also showcases a price gauging Honestly the way I look at this mess now I m not touching this gen Value is gone Mid range looks like it will be expensive too
Now they just need cuda cores
Honestly I think it has more to do with price than generational spec comparison You have budget oriented buyers mid range buyers enthusiasts and people who get the best no matter what So IMO what matters more than names and specs is if you spend the same what performance do you get vs cards at that price point People have a target budget what gets you the most in that bracket Fuck the names if at 600 the best performance you can get is the last gen 6950XT get that It s an amazing card and probably overkill for anyone without a 4k monitor I think it s completely reasonable for the last gen product to become the new mid tier or budget card It happens in other markets like the iPhone and imo it s not anti consumer so long as you can still get a lot of performance for your money And that s still going to be the case for people buying last gen cards for quite a while especially second hand I also think it s great to push budget buyers to the used market t expect the brand new greatest latest to be budget oriented because you can get a lot of performance for not much money and GPUs last a long time I just wish this was a bit clearer in the naming and product launches The 2080 performs better than the 3060 which is confusing because 3060 is the newer card with a bigger number So it fits the trend for the newer 7800XT to not be as good as the 6950XT But I don t think it s completely bad for consumers except that the price ceiling has been rising But that s separate from the problem of relative performance
Pretty easy to get away with price increases when you look at what their competition is doing
Hey brother you just opened a recently closed wound I was fighting for any GPU at AMD queue for MSRP and ended up getting the 6800 non XT after so many weeks
The 6800 was much more appropriately priced though on paper The 7900XT is basically a 6800XT replacement at a pretty egregious price increase
6800 was my favorite card last gen as it was the most power efficient card stock of that generation
When the 7900 XTX sells out and the only ones available are at scalper prices people will flock to the 7900 XT at MSRP
Yes in pure raster that looks to be accurate I suspect AMD will do a power hog variant 7950XT that slightly exceeds 4090 in raster to which NVIDIA will counter with a full fat die 4090Ti that may actually burn a house down
Probably the AIB cards wont be 1000 they be more like 1200 though
Let's see how the 7800xt price performance is first
Sadly it does look that way But regardless 90 class cards are mostly geared towards uneducated buyers anyway Wise gamers buy 70 80 class
For 100 it makes the decision quite easy at least
I was thinking about this I'm sure the cards are way cheaper for them They just want crazy margins Now we leave in a world where 1000 for a gpu is reasonable thanks to nvida face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy Hopefully people speak with their wallets and not social media post Is great to know people aren't fooled 250 increased is not much fun
Well let's hope that the leaks of 3GHZ clock speeds were true
Remember when leaks were saying the next gen flagship GPUs were going to be 2 3X as fast This is why I never trust those leaks
I do loathe the generations where the majority of performance increase is in the halo products and the rest of the stack have middling gains I hope it doesn t become the normal moving forward It s certainly not going to help drive adoption of ray tracing and 4K displays if performance improvements for low and mid range cards isn t adequate All we can do is wait and see
The early stuff I saw regarding 7700xt performance was in comparison to the 6900xt not the 6950xt
It's to make the 7900 XTX a no brainer upgrade It's an upselling tactic If it's called 7800XT then it doesn't make sense to have that 899
So this is a sign that clearly states their intention to price their new generation cards one tier up
7900 Xt 7950 XT 7970 XT
Theyre doing the same shit as nvidia and somehow way less people call their bullshit Everyone shit on nvidia because 4080 use different die than 4090 and rightfully so but they're silent when amd did the same shit as nvidia 7800 xt will use different die than 7900 xt x this time unlike 6800 xt and 6900 xt Company gonna be company trying to squeeze your dollar out of your pocket
AMD is not releasing a dual GCD GPU this gen and I'll gladly eat my words if it actually happens If they had the design down you would've seen it announced a couple weeks ago to compete and likely beat the 4090 in performance My guess is they did a lot of R D attempts at a multi GCD package but couldn't get over the inherent latency issues Even if you would see a large uplift in raster and RT for example maybe the 1 lows in framerate were awful making it basically unusable as a consumer product Of course it's all just speculation but the fact that a lot of people were expecting a dual GCD product and we didn't get one is pretty telling MCM design didn't pan out as AMD was hoping for this gen
Up to 60fps which isn t great
How so
Indeed sad times The heel turn you always knew was coming but its still too soon
I can't believe I'm saying this but our hope now with Intel Battlemage with better RT and hopefully reasonable pricing
Let s see what the cards actually cost can t even believe those suggested retail prices in this day and age
If only the next slide in the presentation was raytracing data 's not great
Inb4 7800XT MSRP 799
DLSS 3 0 numbers don't count Doesn't represent real performance
4K max no RT no FSR I think it's deceptive to say max settings when it's literally not as RT is disabled but that's what it is I'm guessing the 43 58FPS number you're quoting for the 4090 is with RT
I bet these numbers have no raytracing and uses fsr
Says rasterization if thats raw 70 fps without fsr then thats insane i have my doubts though as always gotta wait for reviews x200B Im hoping for the best jensen needs a kick in the nuts
Over two months worth of rent Please tell me where I can find this Utopia Then I too could afford a 7900 XTX lol
Buying a house is too expensive so you might as well spent the rest of your income on a computer you use 2 8hours a day depending on the type of person you are 1000 is not much if you don't have a wife and kids This is 1000 once every 2 4 years not 1000 every month A lot of young men these days work come home play games sleep repeat
Yields should be good on these small gcd die and tiny mcd die Multi die packaging costs will be much the same for either card so no savings there 2 less memory chips are probably the biggest difference in the bill of materials for the 2 cards Part of it is probably fixed costs remaining static between cards And part is likely an upsell tactic which is very common in marketing This pricing tells me they want the mix weighted toward 7900xtx over 7900xt
Normally I'd agree but AMD are usually very fair with their numbers they don't lie and manipulate nearly as much as their competitors do With Ryzen 5000 they promised 19 performance improvement from Ryzen 3000 and reviews showed that was accurate With Ryzen 7000 they promised 15 performance improvement it turned out to be 29
This is substantially higher then usually seen from the non x models I don't think ryzen has had a gap like this at all only one that would be close would be the Vega 56 I think
Up to is average but this is just lawyer speak since configs can vary between person to person
You should not be comparing it to 4090 at all considering AMD themselves confirmed they won t compete with it Furthermore this up to nonsense makes things even more deceptive so take everything with a grain of salt and just wait for independent reviews
and I hate how it is Up to and not average fps The FPS are not up to the settings are
Do you have a link to that I don't remember seeing the 7900 XT in the old data
They didn't catch up to nvidia in raytracing but they gained on them So you're still getting good performance especially when enabling FSR 3
I agree if you really want RT then Nvidia all the way but in fairness RT is kinda naff and not worth even thinking about
Why
Don't be daft The numbers are average FPS The up to is just a stupid legal disclaimer and refers to the largest average FPS increase across the games shown
55 generational uplift is nothing to scoff at It's pretty darn good Especially considering it's actually cheaper than the previous gen 6950xt was 1099 The GPU actually has more raw uplift than that but we're getting to the point where the raw performance doesn't really scale with the gaming performance due to CPU Game Engine overheads
it literally says in rasterization in the title
On these graphs up to is normally used for legal reasons just in case you have CPU bottlenecks or something on your computer it generally means average
OMFG this bullshit again it's been explained over and over A it's average fps B up to is just legal CYA language they and Intel and nVidia and lots of others use to cover their butts and make it not a legally binding promise they can be sued for to protect themselves from some freaking moron taking one of these cards and putting it in a PC from ten years ago That is CPU bottlenecked and going WHY NO PERFORMANCE INCREASE
Obviously not
No that's just idiotic disclaimer talk The numbers are the average frame rate The up to refers to the highest gains in average frame rate they are reporting here Some games could be higher but we won't really know until Steve from Hardware Unboxed loses a few days of sleep doing a 50 game benchmark at some point after release
The Up to is obviously in regards to the
Watch this become true in 5 generations or so lol
But not nearly as cut down as the 4080 16GB is from the 4090 9728 vs 16384 cores
lol Whaaaat XD
Up to is marketing speak to protect them self incase someone uses an old CPU and gets worse FPS and claims that the performance figures are misleading So up to doesn't mean max FPS because that would be so stupid and easy to manipulate You could just look at the ground or sky and get much higher FPS than you would really get if you played games normally It obviously means average FPS
Read the footnotes The up to here is to account for people using different hardware These are not the best results they could possibly achieve but rather they are just the results they achieved with the setup described in the footnotes The up to is to guard against complaints from people who use a different setup including drivers and god knows what else
It's not max fps It's average fps That's obvious by the score of the 6950xt The up to is legal speak so they don't get sued by some idiot who got 1fps less than AMD promised
The up to is in regards to settings how does nobody understand this
It is average it's just a disclaimer for people running weaker other hardware You wont get these average if you pair it with a 2600X obviously
4090 is 2 times more expensive for like max 30 more fps
OMFG this bullshit again it's been explained over and over A it's average fps B up to is just legal CYA language they and Intel and nVidia and lots of others use to cover their butts and make it not a legally binding promise they can be sued for to protect themselves from some freaking moron taking one of these cards and putting it in a PC from ten years ago That is CPU bottlenecked and going WHY NO PERFORMANCE INCREASE
in regards to the
This is indeed averages Even for RDNA 2 graphs AMD indicated only upto in charts The upto here refers to the GPU combination with the fastest available CPU according to AMD This is done to avoid legal problems since someone could test it with a weaker CPU and get weaker results
I'm surprised no brand loyalist hasn't jumped in to insist that up to is CYA lawyer speak for average performance even tho they don't know what CYA is nor do they have any supporting evidence that lawyers ever use the phrase that way Up to has always meant best result under ideal conditions it has never been used to indicate overall averages I mean we have a word for that average
because the XT are binned down XTXs that failed validation
Not sure why Techspot and HardwareUnboxed said High Quality but the results were like this at 4k RT off 4090 83fps 6950XT 49fps
All games with raytracing work with AMD now I believe However some don't have FSR although this is changing which is required for good performance
Not sure if you ve ever played but it s a pretty intense game with a style similar to cyberpunk s It s Ray tracing implementation also looks very good and it very intense like cyberpunk s There also is a built in benchmarking tool in the game It doesn t have FSR though which is kinda stupid
Go buy a 6900xt right now It's way below msrp
Are you sure Can you count the number of bars for each comparison It looks like something popped up in the middle
The place HUB tested got 88 fps average and the place AMD tested got 68 fps It's not that hard to understand

You were right congratulations for seeing what others could not including me Hopium is one hell of a drug
Or maybe XTX will be sold out at MSRP and only available at a markup
Agreed it also need a price drop of 100
True it was clear but this cements it From the specs I could have guessed that maybe there's a bottleneck making the 7900 XTX not perform that well but numbers in games don't hide anything
Probably a mixture of upselling the higher model and simply not having enough defective dies to actually make them ie the upselling makes some sense
I think the XT is simply for non spec XTX dies They designed them both and once production started they saw high yield rates for the XTX so they worsed the value proposition for the XT to upsell and or discourage buying the cheaper part
Kinda funny how AMD's 'n Nvidia's decoy pricing go in the opposite direction
price anchoring
The 7900XT the direct successor of the 69 50 XT It has almost the same cores CUs 7900XT 899 6900XT 999 The 7900XT is not really a sell up AMD just made the 7900XTX too cheap for this market AMD just watered down pricing in a market where Nvidia is raising them It may look like an up sell and feel like one but in the end AMD is clearly lowering prices Maybe not to an extent we want but better than a 2500 RTX 4090 The 7900XTX will sell for 1500 I suppose I just feel like you give the 7900XT bad credit for being a bit overpriced compared to the 7900XTX which is only the case because the 7900XTX offers insane value for a insane price but still
Yes but also no The pricing is reflective of how much supply AMD has of these cut down parts relative to the full die parts And at 300mm2 GCD will yield well It s 899 because they wouldn t be able to provide adequate supply of these parts at the 799 price point Of course there is business reasons The 899 price point leaves a ton of room to price the Navi32 silicon based on how it performs where Nvidia prices their competition
Can you blame em In the past it was the opposite where the cut down card was far more popular The cut down card was way better value which in return does hurt AMDs margins From a business standpoint it makes little sense to have the cut down be more popular than the full Chip Especially with RDNA2 you could see that they havent really produced and sold a whole lot of 6800s Thats because the 6800 only exists because of the chips that couldnt make it as a 6800xt The same story will happen here
Makes me sad for all the complete idiots who will buy this card But hey not to worry it's just natural selection A fool and his money are easily parted and all
They used to have the cheaper one be better value at least with Vega
Still not as bad as the 4080 12gb or should I say 4070ti
What is with this gen usually it's the other way around Spend more to get that last available 10 but lower tiers were better value N
Y 's like 12fps more at cyberpunk that's not a lot of frames Both seem viable
Similar to how NVIDIA tried to do it with the 4080 12GB
Not really it be pointless if 10 and then to able to over clock it to the close the gap
Well there s power consumption too
Yeah but the problem is I d need a bigger PSU for the XTX Which would require a whole new case ugh
its also actually an 7800xt
It exists to sell broken dies
15 17 based on my math Will probably end up like 15 5 slower across more games About 5 worse value than the 7900xtx It's really not that bad particularly if you're trying to fit in a lower power budget
I think part of the appeal is that it's a 300W card instead of a 355W card That means there are more compatible PSUs and motherboards It's for people that want a 6900XT replacement at the same power draw
Only if you buy from scalpers will it be more Or you buy some crazy high board partner model
this card kills the 7800xt as they will likely cut it even more to launch anywhere near 700 and with 30 less performance of the 7900xt you are better off getting a 6900xt for 500
we need Intel to step up their game this lack of competition is killing it for normal consumers like us knowing Intel though they'd probably do the same
4090 does not look like a good value proposition It's 't want a space heater
AMD doing Nvidia tactic We'll see soon enough Going NV tactic would be claiming 1000 MSRP but selling it for at least 1200 2080Ti style or for 1500 4090 style which despite faux MSRP of 1600 which should translate to 1900 Euro with VAT costs 2300
If next gen is coming within the next 2 years I highly doubt AMD would have moved on to 3nm by then Even Zen 5 which is coming around the same time is split between 3 and 4nm chips I think it's going to be 5 4nm again I also doubt multichip GCD is going to come to fruition for AMD by RDNA 4 Multi chip compute tiles are way more complicated than multi chip memory tiles and should probably be avoided until the need for it really arrives as going multi compute tiles presents many problems Hell Nvidia still does not see the benefit from going MCM at all I doubt we would see multi GCD until the next couple generations at best especially in gaming cards
The numbers AMD has shown for RT on these cards aren't great but I'd wait and see how things end up The 7900 XTX is cheaper than the 4080 and it will be interesting to see how far behind RT performance is especially considering that rasterisation performance should be better
Worse value which is usually the opposite
yep this is basically glorified 7800XT still trying to abuse the shortage for new hardware
This should've been between 650 to 800 900 is way too steep for it
You can get a 5600 and RX 6600 and pretty much match the consoles It'll obviously still be more expensive in total but that's PC
gaming PCs are becoming more of an enthusiast tier thing more than ever They've always sorta been gaming PC's are just the expensive premium upgrade some choose to get
7900xtx price is already good for the level of performance compared to Nvidia 7900xt could have been 50 cheaper though We will see where it actually lands next to the 4080 which costs 300 more
Up to 17 actually
It's funny that you think as if it's a matter of being upset and as if it's a matter of only my opinion
We'll have to wait and see how the 7700 XT performs and how it's priced I'm cautiously optimistic but if you take the 6500 XT vs 5500 XT that wasn't a good upgrade Still I'm guessing that AMD will try to do some NVIDIA beating
Nice efficiency increase
And after 3 driver updates probably 1 8x
1440p is going to be cpu bottlenecked just like the 4090
I mean launch price of 6950xt was 1100 Don't think it's quite fair to compare like that for value when the prices have dropped so dramatically for last gen cards
You're almost in the same boat as me I got a used 6800xt Asrock taichi for 450 I had the same reasoning Plus I could sell my 3060Ti for 350 so a very cheapo upgrade
Yeah I don't know if there's any point in waiting for the mid range RDNA3 cards for anyone upgrading or building a new system They'll probably be a good value a year after release with some price drops and maybe some 50xt refresh models but as it stands the perf looks like it'll be right in line with the outgoing RDNA2 models at current pricing
It's a 300mm2 die we don't know if they would cut it further or if the 7800 XT is going to be based on Navi 32 which has 60CU according to angstronomics
The 7900 XT is barely 25 faster than the 6950 XT there is almost no space for a 7800 XT
I would guess the 7800XT will be about on par with or a tiny bit ahead of the 6900XT A 15 20 bump over the 6950XT would put it way too close to the 7900XT per the pic above that the price difference would make the 7900XT a bad value
Based on these numbers the XT is 20 faster than the 6950 XT
Isn't RT a gimmick according to this sub Why would it matter if the raster performance is the most important metric
RTRT still isn't important to the overwhelming majority of gamers Either way it's a 50 bump per CU according to AMD's claims That translates into a full Navi 32 card having 12 5 better RTRT than the 6950 XT at the same clock speed 60 CU 1 5 80 CU Given the performance hit that RTRT effects have that's not even a perceptible difference most of the time it might be 34fps instead of 30fps for example
Less power consumption too
AMDs own benchmarks show only 25 faster RT capabilities regardless of what their engineering team says The 7900xtx brings 50 faster RT FPS with 20 more cores than the 6950xt As well as general raster performance 1 5 1 2 1 25 25 more RT performance per core So an 80 cu RDNA3 chip would only be 25 faster than a 6950xt in both RT and raster performance A more likely 72 CU 7800xt would be 25 faster in raster and RT than a Rx 6800 xt
Probably n32
Highly doubt it when the gap between the 6800XT and 6900XT isnt that big
54 faster per watt So if the 7800 XT uses a lower power draw this generation I wouldn't expect it to be 54 faster overall But we'll have to wait and see
they don't want to sell the XT to endusers they probably want to sell units to OEMs The XT lets them bin defective XTX chips down a level reducing the cost of the XTX by increasing effective yields
I mean their last gen top gpu cost 1 100 so that's a good discount Also if you look at its equivalent which is the 6900xt it's a 54 performance Improvement just like the 7900 xdx is a 54 Improvement over the 6950xt
I mean not really the CU counts are roughly equivalent and it gives 54 performance improvement over the 6 900xt while the 7900 XTX gives a 54 performance Improvement over the 6950xt so technically they're slotting into similar brackets while costing 100 less even though they would be priced at 1 200 USD if they kept up with inflation
Well Ideally it should be 500 but am just talking relatively compared to 999 price of 7900xtx
I agree and 7900xtx should be no more than 900
well sucks that it can only output 4k 120fps then
What do you mean Faster compared to what card
Y 's how the high end usually is Performance increases significantly less than price does so it was never a smart decision to get the halo product because it was a poor value That's why it's so astounding that the 4090 was the best value The 3090 performed 15 better than the 3080 for 2x the price which is way worse than the 350 increase from the 6800 XT to the 6900 XT
Maybe a slight better loss but still a loss High end gaming pretty much starts at 899 right now
They're the smallest pineapples you could voluntarily get brutally rammed up your own ass Win
That s exactly what the person you re replying to is saying The 7900 XT is just a renamed 7800 XT It s 250 more than what the 6800 XT msrp was
I don't know the spec of the cards but the 6900xt was even faster in some games than the 3090 now the 7900xt successor doesn't even get close to the 4090 at anything The 6900xt was matching the Nvidia top tier card and costing 500 USD less that was a real MVP this 7900xt is just another GPU with a weird name
Eventually these companies are going to run out of minor steppings x700 used to be beginning of the high end with x800 flagship Then it was x800 and x900 Then x950 came Now x900 is both the beginning of high end and the flagship all at the same time due to XT and XTX Honestly where COULD they go with 8000 series 8990 XX Special X Edition Then what do they call the 9000 flagship
It's value compared to the 4080 too well assuming the numbers line up as reported
That's true and right but 4090 had a very big price to begin with if we look at RTX 3080 RX 6800 XT pricing it's not that great anymore and the 7900 XT is just bad it should have been a 799 card at most
Sounds about right rolling on the floor laughing Everyone that has a 6800 got it because they couldn't get a 6800 XT The 7900XTX real 7900XT competes against the 4080 and the 7900 XT aka 7800 XT sits between the 4070 Ti 4080 12GB and 4080 16GB That's quite unfortunate since AMD's last rival to the 3080 was only 670 MSRP Now it's either a 1200 GPU or a 1000 AMD simply upped prices more elegantly and some how nobody in the community noticed
Indeed I said it on launch day and made a post about it on this sub unfortunately it got downvoted to hell
The real reason AMD priced 7900xt the way they did is most likely because they won't make many of them since the yields on 7900xtx having only a 308mm 2 GCD will be good enough not to have to bin many of them Had they priced it any lower they wouldn't have been able to keep them in stock 7800xtx will be interesting
to which NVIDIA will counter with a full fat die 4090Ti that may actually burn a house down They don't really have to crank power that much Just make it the full die and give it faster GDDR6X There's plenty of disabled GPU to work with this time compared to the 3090 3090 Ti situation They also stuck the 4090 with slower G6X than they could have given it 4080 has faster modules
The 4090ti won t be a graphics card anymore It will only be graphics
Same with Nvidia
guessing 6950 xt performance for 699
Wise gamers buy 70 80 class says the dude with the 3070 You know as well as I do if someone has the money to buy a 90 class card and it's not a big deal they buy the 90 class card not 70 80 Don't flatter yourself
I don't think there has ever been a 70 80 class card purchaser with above 10 IQ Enlightened folk buy 60 class cards for maximum frames or preferably salvage a PC off the side of the road for free for infinite value
Lmfao
Exactly as AMD intended
Considering the 6900xt and 6950xt are like 5 apart the 7700xt isn t going to do better than a 6900xt either Seems like those 600 dollar 6900xts are a crazy good deal
Not only that but in this case they can use the more midrange Navi 32 as the chip for 7800 XT instead of 7700 XT as they did with the 6700 XT Basically even more market segmentation and upselling
Using a different die isn't the issue here lol it's using a lower tier die at 1200 It's totally logical for the 6800xt to use N32 so long as it isn't priced to high hell and it beats the 6950xt in performance
For the nth time it's just legal words to cover their asses when you try to pair a 7900 xt with a mid tier cpu at best and try to replicate their numbers on 4k
the 7800xt matching the 6950xt would mean the 6800xt to 7800xt got only a 15 improvement On top of that the 6950xt can be found for less than 700 now The 6900xt even less
face with head bandage Ouch
It seems like raytracing tech still just blows at 4k If you're gaming in 4k it probably isn't worth it What kind of numbers do the 4000 series cards put up
Ouch 24 FPS in Dying Light 2
can't wait for the 7900xt and 7900xtx unlaunch
I see dlss and fsr so much these days it's insane Preferably you don't want even want to use those features especially on high end cards
We need DLSS 2 numbers to compare to FSR 3 numbers
Car with turbo doesn't count Not real performance Only displacement matters
Since many games are launching with these features I don't think it's as unfair as it was a generation or 2 ago I always use DLSS FSR where I can because of the performance gains and I don't think I'm an outlier These features should probably be compared to the performance gains of going to a higher DirectX since they're becoming universal
lol what Wtf is fake performance This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard AMD fanboys are wild
I wouldn t call it deceptive since it clearly states this is the performance in rasterization with max settings and not RT performance with Max settings
RT and max settings has been treated as two seperate things by most reviews I d say it s completely fair
With RT at the newest Psycho setting most likely
It's raw no FSR if it was FSR it would be mentioned like on the RT slide
It's with FSR their slide confirms it here So this perf basically only levels with an RTX 3080 Ti In some games the gains maybe larger but it seems in Cyberpunk it is well and truly behind Ada Lovelace
It's just disappointing that the budget offering is worse value than the premium one But I guess both are light years better value than nvidia right now
Stop saying this No one has ever used up to to indicate overall average It is and has always meant this is the maximum you could get under ideal conditions but it could also very well be less and we would still be correct
I know AMD claimed it's not competing with the 4090 but the numbers they posted should be taken with a grain of salt but AMD's late history of data comparison has been quite accurate so idk how to feel about it are definitely in the 4090 area
They have given the 6950 results so it should be fairly easy to determine if the 7900XTX result is max fps or an average According to TechPowerup the 6950XT gets the following at 4K RE V 133fps Cyberpunk 38fps Watchdogs Legion 64fps I reckon AMD is showing averages here since the peak fps would be a fair bit higher in all these games on the 6950XT
How is up to 67 more performance related to setting
oh you're right lmao I dunno how I completely forgot about the XT
Yeah but why then even buy the card in the first
This is not an excuse though Intel Arc their first dgpu has comparable RT with RTX 3000 series
Not enough performance gains in RT and AI compared to 20 series Nvidia cards and poor advancement in Raster for the time and price I bought a 6800 in 2020 and these cards will effectively be available in 2023 so much time for so little gains And even with the chiplet approach they still raised prices It's disappointing
Sorry but NO Don't let yourself be fooled by copium Up to means top best result in ideal circumstances Average means on average The two phrases do not meet If they displayed averages they would have labeled them as averages I keep seeing people parrot this up to mean avErAgE CYA lawyer speak but not one of you have ever posted any proof of the claim
Then they shouldn't say Max Settings on the slide
If it's average FPS they can say average fps Nobody can sue them for not seeing the same performance metrics that is idiotic There is no need to cover their ass for such a case
All of you keep repeating this lawyer CYA language but have never once given any supporting evidence for such a usage In every mainstream usage of up to the phrase means this is what you could get in an ideal situation but it could also very well fall significantly below that and we don't want to be responsible for that Up to means the absolute best you can get whereas average means what you can expect to get for the majority of your usage time Do not conflate the two
So you're saying that they just have poor grammar and probably shouldn't be in charge of publishing anything
Sorry but no If the numbers are averages then they should be labeled as such If I average 70fps most of the time but there are edge cases where I get 92fps I'm not going to say I get 92fps on average Id say I get up to 92 but on average I get 70 Idk where this up to means average CYA lawyer speak shtick came from but I've not seen a shred of evidence for it
They're embracing the username
Thanks makes sense My fault for reading this slide out of context
Makes sense thanks for clarifying
The slide doesn't say average but does say up to I'll trust the wording on the slide itself over your speculation
Down voting you because you're just repeating what you've read it's CYA layer speak without ever looking for evidence that the phrase has ever been used that way Y'all just saw one person make the excuse didn't want to question it and repeated it as infinitum because it makes you feel better about numbers not being as good as you want
I see nothing that indicates they are averages
You've been repeating this for god knows how many threads without providing a single shred of evidence that this is how AMD intends for the data to be interpreted Up to by and large means this is the peak you could get in ideal situations but on average you might end up a fair bit below that If AMD meant for these to be averages they would SAY averages This whole people need to understand lawyer speak shtick just feels like people coping for the numbers not aligning with their expectations especially when they provide no evidence that the phrase is ever used the way they're saying
Oh cool so it's not feature locked by Nvidia anymore
It doesn t have FSR though which is kinda stupid Because FSR didn't exist yet when the game came out and by the time FSR did come out Ubisoft stopped releasing any big updates for the game
The Nitro is still 1k euro here if I order from germany the Red Devil is 1k too mindfactory doesnt have Nitro
That's practically a given at this point
Yes but so will the XT
I would never support markup would rather just wait out for 1 year without gpu
I don't know a card that doesn't need at least a 100 dollar price drop
Agreed it also need a price drop of 100 500
I am sure it will get one when the 4070Ti hits basically undercutting it on price and outperforming it on average
They both need price drop of 200 also 7900xtx The performance in not as we expect It would be interesting 7800xt performance if the 7900xt is this low
No need to discount anything will sell everything in the blink of an eye
Yeah makes sense that as part of the point here is keeping yields high they might be able to produce a relatively high proportion of the full die SKU
r AMD when Nvidia upsells it's bad but when AMD upsells we will find a way to construe it as a good thing
This is what I was going to say If they made it cheaper they might end up in a situation like the Ryzen 1600 where it sold so well that they had to take good eight core dies and disable two cores just to cover the demand
This makes perfect sense They could also be holding a price drop in reserve for when Nvidia inevitably makes a counter move
none of that really matters though the card is either good value or it's not the reasons why don't really matter just like good yields on Zen3 didn't really justify cranking the 6C segment to 300 pricing either People being willing to come up with these kinds of rationalization for their preferred brand is part of the parasocial relationship thing I don't think it's factually supportable and if it were a different brand NVIDIA most of the people doing this would be screaming about price decoys but either way it doesn't matter what matters is providing good value to the market and 7900XT doesn't do that To be fair I'm Mr costs are going up faster than people realize myself in general but 4080 and 7900XT are obviously the cases where that is NOT true and there are specific reasons why those SKUs are being raised up It's not normal to see the big SKUs offer better value than the cutdowns that's the obviously problematic bit here I think people also generally discount that AMD is just as afraid of the miner stockpile as NVIDIA is and afraid of NVIDIA's 30 series stockpile At the right price a 3080 is a definite competitor to the 7900XT and NVIDIA and miners ultimately will price them where they have to be to move So AMD gains nothing by cutting their own throat on pricing they want to keep prices high and let 30 series inventory burn through just as much as NVIDIA does That's why they pulled Navi 33 back and launched the big chips first too the original plan was midrange cards first AMD changed a few months ago and went with the same big chips first and wait for 30 series miner cards to sell through as NVIDIA Honestly they seem more scared of it than I expected I kinda figured they'd launch sooner and push a little harder on the 7900XT pricing But if there's not a problem for them why push back Navi 33 That plus the high prices on the cutdown really looks like they're avoiding putting price pressure on the legacy market just like NVIDIA for whatever reason Miner inventory NVIDIA inventory or their own or whatever reason I'm not really 100 sure on the why either but they're doing the same slow walk as NVIDIA and this was not the original plan Navi 33 next chip down was supposed to come first
XT is the same die as XTX
I imagine they were confident enough that TSMC would produce high yields of the XTX The package design seems rather resilient because the cache is offloaded to larger process chiplets and the main die is on a process thats been used for other purposes so TSMC probably has the institutional knowledge to crank whatever out of that node at pretty good yields Also even Navi 31 at its biggest is pretty small
I mean if they literally don't have enough defect dies to make as many 7900XT as would be demanded at 800 without doing artificial cuts on good dies then raising the price is the best way to adjust demand to the available supply of defect dies
Eh I thought they were both doing an upsell 4090 shaping up to be much better value than 4080 despite being expensive Likewise 7900XTX is seemingly better value than 7900XT In both cases the hardware on the smaller card is cut down a bit too much compared to the reduction in price
Yes but it makes more money like this
12 fps at a base of 60 is a whoppin 20 more frames for a measly 11 increase in price Hilarious no
Stop fucking coping no you wont Hit 3GHz or some bullshit the cards will be at the near limit
Which you could just turn down with the Power target the measly 55W
You're confusing average power draw with transient power spikes which was really only an issue with high end RTX 30 cards The 450w RTX 4090 when it's connector isn't melting runs just fine on an 850w PSU so I would hope that AMD cards don't reintroduce an issue that has been fixed by Nvidia
Those may be the only options depending on supply We ve seen it before where cards that sell at the listed MSRP only account for a small percentage of the available supply meaning that the majority of people end up having to buy a more expensive partner model or buy a reference card from a scalper
The 7900XT should really be 7800XT at 799 ideally Because otherwise you will have another 7800XT that is barely faster than 6950XT and that doesn't makes any sense
The 7900xtx is only 100 more but the card it's replacing 6800XT was 250 cheaper I mean it's super obvious the 7900XT is replacing the 6800XT But again Nvidia is way worse increasing the price of 4080 by 500 but bering worse does not pardon amd for doing what they're doing
I'm just comparing AMD to AMD and Nvidia to nvidia
Looks like the only reason 7900XT exists is to use up dies that didn t make the cut for XTX
Absolutely true Things changed over time but the 5800X was a head scratcher at launch if you didn't accept that this literally was what they were doing
AMD remained consistent in pricing It's Nvidia who's going off the rails
It's 't want a space heater Running the 4090 will genuinely cost a pretty penny esp here in Europe where some countries have electricity prices reaching 0 8 kWh
Power limit to 300w and lose 2 performance in games
It doesn't actually use that though in most games as it's often voltage limited It just has a weirdly high TGP for some reason
Sure but pricewise it's being shown as being the better performer for the price paid when comparing it to a 4080 Just like 7900xtx looks to be the better value for the money Vs a 7900xt Not liking that lower segments are being overpriced to make the top tier look like good value It's absurd that they even cost 4 digits It is fricking insane how some are like oh wow it's cheap when it's still stupid expensive Like others said the 7900xt is 250 higher MSRP than the 6800xt
The 4090 can be limited to 300 watts and still get 95 96 performance At 150W limit it performs the same as a 350W 3080
lmfao what MSRP is only guaranteed for FE models and since when does pricing translate to the same numbers across different economies IE 1600 USD must be 1600 Euro
Pretty much every company that released consumer electronics in the last six months has had higher prices because of the currency tanking That s far from an Nvidia issue
Going NV tactic would be claiming 1000 MSRP but selling it for at least 1200 Back in 2021 AMD AIB's were charging more than 1500 for 999 RX 6900XT's The PowerColor Liquid Devil special edition or whatever its name was was 2500 at Microcenter and Microcenter doesn't scalp
What do you Nvidia doesn't see the benefit of MCM
Nvidia still does not see the benefit from going MCM at all they would if they tried but alas they are multiple years behind on such technology Sure they are making a good job with the monolithic die but at the same time they have been consistently making 600mm2 dies with the associated lower yields and there's a physical limit on how big you can make a die before it gets unwieldy to manufacture and implement
which is usually the opposite We live in a new era where bang for your buck somehow no longer is about the same as lower midrange
It's not
Any chance AMD might have a change of heart by reducing the price of the 7900XT
I think it's more like they realized how uncompetitive Nvidia is in value Even at 900 dollars it utterly curb stomps Nvidia's offerings since they're still reheating the leftovers
Yes that would be more expensive in the short run but in the long run it is more cost efficient let say you pay 1000 for your pc get your self some decent specs yes that is double the cost of a console but those specs will hold up for lets say the next 8 9 years thats if you dont what to play 4k at 60 fps or more but 1080p is still most played and even some older gpus can still run 1440p You don't have to have the newest console every 3 years but most console gamers do upgrade because as there are newer console there are games that the older one can't play So in that 9 years you would have spent 1500 on consoles where you could have spent that in pc upgrades or if you really want and save that to get you something like a 7900 xtx which would still cost you less then the consoles and would future proof your pc for a even longer time Edit had a misconception about console releasing every 3 years sorry guys Then not a bad deal on consoles still you can do more on pc's and I still believe it is a better option at the end of the day
Nope Xbox GPU is about a 6700xt
Just get a Steam Deck 4k gaming the tools the deck provide make it not too hard to get most run pretty smoothly plex server workstation monster beast you name it
I mean a computer can do exponentially more things than a console can I should hope it would cost more Consoles are cheap because the only thing they are built for is exclusively gaming
They do 4k pretty damn well Not like the 30xx or 6xxx series could do 4k high fps either Most people don't really need a home computer anymore as most of the stuff they used to do on a computer browse web watch videos send emails they can do on a phone A handful of power users who actually use computers for their job can benefit from having a gaming computer For others a 500 console plus a 300 laptop does the job for school etc
I have been liking and supporting AMD whenever I can since I was like 13 14 years old back in 08 09 but common let s be honest here the prices only seem good in comparison to the shit Nvidias pulled as well as the raises msrp on 6900 6950xt last year scalpers And the XT is only there to make the XTX seem like the best deal it s similar to the tactic Nvidia has employed with the 4090 4080 It s still a decent deal tho
The important part is the 'up to'
The games we're seeing are the games they optimized drivers for
Not with how their drivers are working recently with hardware acceleration being broken though im starting to learn more towards microsoft breaking something recently
The 7900XTX is slower than the 4090 Also it was well established that RDNA2 has less CPU overhead than Nvidia
very nearly same boat I had a 2080 Super that I sold for 275 so the upgrade felt like a no brainer because my 2080 would only further drop in value once the new AMD GPUs are announced
I'm about to sell a 6800XT for the same in USDs either now or next week on r hardwareswap
Got the 520 AR MSI Z trio for my new build after watching prices and announcements and feel pretty good about where that falls price performance wise now The 7900XTX is clearly a big boost but nearly 2x the price if you can get it at MSRP Upgrading from a 2015 980ti and it should be damn near twice the performance upgrade from my old rig Finally being able to do a decent ultrawide setup has me really excited to game again
I think it would dilute the naming scheme a lot having the 800 now a mid range GPU But i guess that's exactly what nvidia have been doing for a long time so AMD can feel free to retire the x800XT name for anything high end It's just sad to see imo
It's 29 faster in 4K raster and 40 45 in 4K RT 40 with and 46 without FSR So there's definately room for a 7800XT that is 10 faster in Raster and 20 faster in RT
I calculated its around 29 faster
Amd did the exact same on 6000 series 6900xt is only 10 faster than 6800xt but 250 more expensive They will probably do the same with 7900xt a paper launch to make 7800xt and 7900xtx the absolute best deal
Speaking for myself I m not overly interested in ray tracing until it s only a 25 performance s are so ridiculously powerful that it doesn t matter The 4090 isn t even at that point yet Maybe the 5090
I wouldn't say that RT is a gimmick in the sense that PhysX or hairworks effects were for nvidia titles but the implementation by devs in most games is lacking Many surfaces are unnecessarily turned into mirrors instead of accurately reflecting environments Store glass windows water and even roads are turned into dead accurate mirrors which does not reflect real life in the slightest Anyway if you ask me I wouldn't say it's worth to halve your performance and go from 80 100 to 40 50 to have accurate shadow positions and reflective surfaces but if the performance holds to more than acceptable levels Sure I would turn those features on
This sub takes a stance on RT depending on if it's beneficial to AMD or not If AMD announces decent gains in RT performance for RDNA3 suddenly it's a cutting edge feature integral to many newer games If Nvidia continues to trounce them in RT then it's a tacked on gimmick
Anything Nvidia can do better than AMD is considered a useless gimmick on this subreddit until AMD is better at it at which point suddenly it becomes a promising new tech This subreddit shits on stuff like CUDA NVENC DLSS and Ray Tracing because AMD either can't do them at all or can't do them as well Then AMD came out with FSR and it's various iterations and suddenly upscaling is a great beneficial option for those who want it Or how the transition from RDNA to RDNA 2 where this sub went from shitting completely on RT when AMD couldn't do it to only shitting on it some of the time now that AMD had hardware to do RT Or how PhysX apparently died out because it didn't matter despite the fact it got shifted to being a CPU based system and became ubiquitous in almost every game engine thereafter It's frankly tiring to read such rhetoric so frequently on this sub It's like everyone has an inferiority complex they're trying to compensate for
It's a gimmick to fanboys People who can't stand to see AMD be behind so they gotta smoke a bunch of copium to rationalize it That being said it seems the lack of major dedicated RT core space isn't hurting AMD much in the Unreal 5 Matrix City demo They were only like 5 behind Nvidia with hardware accelerated Lume on when comparing the 3080 and 6800xt And AMD only had a 5 rater advantage that generation So it seems there are better alternatives to the regular implementation that something like Cyberpunk uses It'll be really interesting to see how the 7900xtx compares to the rtx 4080 in Unreal 5 Because now AMD seems to have like a 20 rasterization advantage while being 20 cheaper These cards might kick ass in UE5 titles But if DLSS3 gets even better and FSR3 is garbage in comparison it could look really bad for AMD
I swear rt is the biggest scam in history and everyone falls for it Its like when Nvidia tried to establish hairworks but back in the day people actually used their thinking cap
It's not a gimmick but it surely is extremly taxing on the HW for what it offers I'd say it's irrelevant at least for several more years EDIT You know it's true when people can't even think of a reason to downvote you
If it's a 50 80 bump per CU why does the 7900xtx only perform 50 better with 20 more cores At the same 80 CU count AMD would only be 30 ahead 1 5 1 2 1 25 So really only 25 faster per CU because percentage are multiplicative not additive I don't know what those engineers are smoking to claim 80 per CU in these slides but it's not showing up in their own benchmarks They've previously shown Cyberpunk only being 46 faster despite the fact it has a 20 CU advantage
That's a good point but I honestly can't remember the last time I saw an AMD GPU in an OEM system
That's the wool being pulled over your eyes 7900XT 20 7900XTX 6800XT 15 6950XT The 6900XT is just 6 from the 6950XT they are basically the same product The 7900XTX should have been the 7900XT and the 7900XT should have been the 7800XT and even then the performance delta would be bigger than in the 6000 series so the current 7900XT is closer to a 6800 non XT Inflation is a pretty flimsy excuse when last year's peices were demolished by the mining boom and covid
Also even though the die is smaller at 300 mm the McD's included make it go above 500 mm total both of which are on a smaller and more expensive die vs rdna2 by at least 20 due to tsmc canceling bulk discounts and at the same time increasing prices
Why not 200
ideally everyone would be entitled to a free 7900 XT and a pony but here we are
Who down voted you face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy Yeah the cards should be 100 cheaper
It depends on what high end means Nvidia and AMD both keep stretching the definition further out 8k gaming 4k 240hz on and on High end gaming just a few years ago meant 4k 60 or 1440p 120 It used to be that the games defined what high end gaming meant Can you run Crysis above 60fps can you get over 100fps in F E A R at 1080p Now AAA graphics have stalled and developers don't make AAA PC exclusives anymore What are Nvidia and AMD gonna do about that They're gonna keep pumping out cards that's what The only way those cards make sense is if the goal posts move Look at raytracing We all know that raytracing doesn't matter and won't matter until developers prioritize it as a foundational part of the lighting and game design in their product and we know that won't happen this console generation because the consoles just aren't up to it So we keep getting unoptimized tacked on shit funded by Nvidia and then featured in every benchmarking review getting published And that's not an attack on Nvidia or raytracing AMD benefits from it too It sells cards You can go buy an RX6900XT from AMD right now for 680 I'd argue that's high end gaming
Not sure what you mean Whatever the 7800XT or 7700XT will wind up being will be a good enough card to pair with a 1440p 144hz monitor
This seems to presume I don t like pineapples rammed up my arse BIG MISTAKE pineapple
It s purposefully disingenuous to blindside less knowledgeable consumers by selling them lesser cards for more money It s literally exactly that same as Nvidia s 12GB 4080 that s a 4060Ti die rebrand which they re now selling as a 4070Ti People rightly lost their shit at that being a 4080 bit no one in media is saying anything about it STILL being up sold as a 4070Ti OR AMD s 7900XT being an upsold 7800 let alone the stupidly confusing adding only a single letter being used on the end to designate a whole product stack and performance tier difference It s absolutely ridiculous face with symbols on mouth
AMD loves Extreme so something like RXe 8975XTXE Extreme Pro Plus Edition isn't out of the question for their best bin
I would say so as well but if it barely beats it in rasterization and gets destroyed in RT I'm not that sure anymore Besides nVIDIA will still beat AMD in terms of software stack notice how I didn't say stability and has much better resell value than AMD if you want to upgrade later due to the card being called nVIDIA RTX and the tendency to avoid AMD cards like plague as if their game would crash every 3 seconds with it so even the value argument becomes harder to justify but again I still believe 7900 XTX will be better and I'd rather buy it at the end of the day
Everyone is distracted by Nvidias 1600 gpu
That's a weird comparison you fixate on the code name instead of the actual generation performance improvement We all know the naming means nothing after the 4080 12gb 4090 did have a 30 performance increase vs the 3090 ti but it comes with a 400 price tag same as 4080 While amd keep the same price tag on 7900xtx with also 30 improvement over 6950xt It isn't amd upping the price because they literally didn't it's Nvidia try to brute force and justify a 1000 price tag on a gpu and mess up people's sense of value Also 7900xtx will probably beat 4080 on raster if the chart is real
Probably because your name is userbenchmark I'm surprised you aren't banned
So I'll wait gor a while to buy one face with tears of joy
Probably not that far off But I'll wait and see
Seems legit but I hope its gonna be 230w max Since the 7900xt is around 25 30 faster than the 6950xt The 7800xt being 25 30 weaker than the 7900xt could mean a big saving in power consumption
You know as well as I do if someone has the money to buy a 90 class card and it's not a big deal they buy the 90 class card We live on different planets then I can easily buy several 4090s but would still go 70 80 class because I know how to assess value and enjoy not get raped by greedy corps Would you spend 500 on a cheeseburger too just because you can Ever hear the phrase just because you can doesn't mean you should 90 class is for the uneducated or emotionally impaired Very few actually buy them for rational reasons aka productivity workloads Reality doesn't agree with you but don't hate the messenger
Salvage a PC You can just imagine games Much more cost efficient
Sounds sarcastic because you didn't understand Have a downvote
Nah the 70 class cards offer more frames per dollar at least before these current discounts This Jen however the value is in the top tier products
Oh no you're one of 'those'
They are closer to 10 apart
They re doing a nvidia disappointed face
Actually last generation chips are not a clear comparison point anymore For eg N21 had 80CU's but N22 only had 40CU's That's like 50 of the top navi die This time N31 has 96CU's and N32 has 60CU's So it's not exactly a halving of CU's
4090 outputting double ish the native RT numbers at 4k
Without any kind of scaling it's still about double at 4k on a 4090
That s not possible
24 FPS in Dying Light 2 my 4090 does 110 Stop using DLSS to lie about your frame rate bro that's the DLSS enabled speed for Dying Light 2 in all the benchmarks I can find for a 4090
More like 60 70
my gpu can talk
It's foolish not to use DLSS and FSR at higher resolutions It's a waste of performance to render a native 3840x2160 pixels when upscaling looks so good at those higher resolutions I would never choose to natively render 4k over using DLSS or FSR
FSR DLSS upscaling is hugely important for hitting 144hz 240hz frame caps even on the highest end cards while also resolving better than native when upscaling 1440p to 4k I don't like it for comparing card performance but it is useful for making a purchasing decision on a specific card The above commenter is calling out DLSS3 0 specifically because it uses frame interpolation which belongs nowhere near a benchmark Upscaling is one thing but inserting fake frames and using it in an FPS number is just useless Nvidia could insert 2 fake frames for every one real frame and triple the FPS count it would still be meaningless and awful to play
I dont know why you wouldnt FSR2 and DLSS are both incredibly useful in select games and if youre running 4k a 5k ultrawide you would be dumb not to use it
Fsr 3 isn't coming out until next year while dlss 3 is currently released Frame generation is a separate setting than dlss 3 and you can test dlss 3 without frame generation fyi
Oh it's really not More frames but also higher input lag and artifacts Maybe one day but not today
That's a bad analogy and makes zero sense It's closer to say recording the car and playing it back at twice the speed to make it LOOK like it ran the track faster
They're hallucinated frames that don't respond to user input Are hallucinations real Also I run a 3080 so there's that
No it's not with FSR that slide where it mentions FSR is IN RAYTRACING This slide is IN RASTERIZATION and does not mention FSR
Shouldn't be surprising as intel shown with arc gpu that as long as amd didn't invest in ray tracing dedicated cores like nvidia they will always be behind nvidia in ray tracing It's embarrassing when intel first attempt at dgpu is better at raytracing than amd Amd need to invest in dedicated ray tracing core asap
Clearly says rasterization
Ya i was hoping for a 2nd cut navi31 7800 to be announced at more like 700 Nvidia going off the deep end with their pricing and amd choosing not to announce a lower priced card in the first batch is the only reason I'm considering a 7900xtx right now If i buy into this generation i don't want to wait for the navi32 based cards and if I don't want to wait and am considering a 900 xt may as well buy a 1000 xtx if the price perf is better
4k max settings up to as for the up to 67 are you mentally challenged that means 67 in one game but less in others
Because it's not worth it
Because Raytracing isn't an actual thing that people use And you get a much faster card for less money Plus you don't support a shitty company that has shitty morals and bad business practices
But it is max settings for raster though
And honestly RT dosnt make me want to buy an Nvidia card for my personal rig The ONLY thing that will make me consider Nvidia again is price because AMD delivers the same for less money
There is a seperate graph for ray tracing that they showed Here
Except you're wrong if they don't put the CYA language in they can and will get sued The person might not succeed but they don't want to deal with it Intel nVidia AMD everyone in this sector uses this language
up to the phrase means this is what you could get in an ideal situation but it could also very well fall significantly below that and we don't want to be responsible for that And in what world is this not lawyer language
I'm not Straight wrong and I'm not Coping this is legal CYA language used by Intel nVidia AMD EVERYFUCKING ONE The fact that you had to come in here and post this shows that the only person here coping is you grow the fuck up
Hey OP Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3 Be civil and follow side wide rules this means no insults personal attacks slurs brigading mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on r AMD Please read the rules or message the mods for any further clarification
I'm saying you should take a few more minutes to think about what you're looking at before making any comment
you can prove if their average just compare their 6950xt numbers to other 6950xt from 3rd party reviews if their close then you can confirm these amd numbers are avg simple as that
oh lo didn't even notice XD
Are you fucking kidding me this is goddamn common knowledge Take off your goddamn tinfoil hat and stop being obnoxious as fuck this isn't we saw one person make this excuse this is We weren't born yesterday and have been literally hearing that disclaimer FOR DECADES Downvoting you for being an idiot
They are though You can infer from past AMD presentations and individual game benchmarks Plus max fps doesn't make sense Any game can have 2 or even 3x spike in FPS for a split second or two
amd 6950xt numbers line up with 3rd party 6950xt avg fps so its avg fps you can shut up now
No Microsoft have made sure of that with a DXR
And that s a real shame too It s a very beautiful game that would benefit from FSR for sure Just like cyberpunk
You mean without a NEW GPU because you still have be one to fulfill your
I know that feel bro forever alone
Hopefully you don't have to wait 2 years like last gen
Back in my day 500 bought u a nasa quality gpu
Even gt730
Now you reminded me of the time when I got my HD 7970 GHz for 400
That ain't happening the days of getting a High end GPU at 500 are long gone That is what I paid for an Ati Radeon 9700 Pro at launch which seems like a life time ago
That card was already unlaunched at 900
4070 is around a 3090 TI so the 7900 XT would still be faster
The performance of the 7900XTX was what I was expecting Some people were expecting a 4090 killer which I think was unrealistic And the 7950 XT or XTX if they release it will probably sit in between the 4090 and the 4090TI
it doesn't make the value proposition better whatever the reason but nVidia uses totally different chips instead of cut down ones so at least the same explanation doesn't hold for them
Nvidia doesn t really care what AMD does lol
Well I mean if they have a constrained production capacity which they normally do they will seek to fill the highest margin SKUs first Lately higher than expected yields for many wafers have encouraged semi conductor makers to price products to encourage the highest margin SKUs
I've always been of the mind that r amd hates things if Nvidia does it and will love the exact same thing if it's instead AMD that does it Kind of like how ray tracing is an obvious useless gimmick so long as Nvidia is better at it but will switch to being a promising technology for the future in any situation where AMD matches Nvidia
It was only 50 bucks why are you crying about it
It wasn't yields that made them crank Zen3 prices it was just wafer supply They couldn't make as many as were demanded Street price for a 5600X was 400 for like 3 months Setting a lower MSRP wouldn't have changed that or the amount of chips they had
That's what they
If yields are high enough then they can position the 7900XT's value proposition to upsell the 7900XTX I think that's what they've done and we can look to any price changes as a sign of the success of that strategy
Well the 7900XTX is really the 7900XT and is launching at 1000 same as the 6900XT So that is fine The 7900XT is really the 7800XT and is launching at 900 instead of 650 like the 6800XT So a pretty big jump there I wouldn t be surprised to see it drop in price later but they don t want to interfere with the remaining 6000 series stock yet
Yea but in the case of 7900XTX and 7900XT the better model is only 100 dollars more expensive A more Reasonable upsell compared to the 400 dollar price difference between 4080 and 4090 Nevertheless AMD might be planning for a bait and switch once 4080 launches and then revise its pricing downwards I hope
Did I say anything about 3ghz just let me know where I mentioned that what you need to go do smoke a cig or take that dick out your 's been the same thing since rnda 1 kinda of since 5700 needed 5700xt bios but you always been able to overclock the non xt to get near xt performance
Eh I didn't mention power spikes at any point so how can I be confused about that I also didn't talk about any Nvidia cards either for that matter I was comparing the 6900 XT 7900 XT and the 7900 XTX for power consumption Most modern PSUs can handle spikes and as you say AMD has smaller power spikes anyway so they aren't even relevant to my comment Realistically you could have a system with say a Ryzen 5600X or 5800X3D a 6900XT and a 600W or 650W PSU An extra 55W might push that over the limit
This is a good point Makes me wonder what the actual 7800 XT is going to look like I suspect what the leaks were saying about the Navi 32 chip with 4 MCDs will actually go into the 7800 XT instead of the 7700 XT like the leaks said
It should be but they are still trying to offload some 6900 6950XT at a reasonable price
Last time it was 350 difference it should be 250 minimum And here you get even more VRAM and bandwith with the 6900 vs 6800 XT you only got 512 shaders and that was all
Or maybe AMD should have introduced a non XT 7900 and made the XTX a regular XT Introducing an XTX on top of an XT when they could have just made a 7900 and 7900XT just needlessly muddies the water of performance tiers
I think because it has 4 more cu it should be 999 which is already a good deal due to inflation but 899 is ludicrous
It should be the 7800XT at 650 like last time
what if there is no 7800xt AMD go straight to 7700XT that slightly beats 6800x probably better marketing
I think both companies believe making the X800 chip a very slightly cut down top die was a mistake So because of that the 7800 XT is probably not gonna be as big of a jump as the 7900 XTX But the 8800 XT will probably be more what we expect
Eh This might very well be 6900 XT and 6950 XT replacements They're still called 79xx We don't have a 78xx replacement yet
Tbh 7900xt is stuck in a weird place AMD could price it at 799 but then that would encroach on the theoretical 649 749 priced 7800xt which is supposed to be a more mainstream card That would make one of the 2 cards a bad value The obvious solution is renaming 7900xt to 7800xt and lower the price to 650 to 700 dollar range but that's not going to happen
Remind me when AMD had a 1100 GPU before RDNA 2 Consistent my ass
0 45kw 0 8 kwh 40 52 is 748 per year It's half the price of the stupid card in electricity costs at that rate
my dude stop acting like a helpless bystander unless you're gaming 10 hours a day just set a very aggressive standby power profile in afterburner and leave it on that whenever you're not really using it
10 actually but for a 50 reduction in power The 4090 can be crazy efficent
Why not just make it efficient out of the box so I don t have to tweak my 1500USD gpu to make it not be a hot mess
Official MSRP of 2080Ti was 1000 Real was 1200 MSRP is only guaranteed Something something leather man good something since when does pricing translate to the same numbers across different economies Amazing reading comprehension skills
Nvidia claimed they already had working prototypes of MCM chips taped out on the 16nm architecture and had tested results 2C HotChips RC18 What's interesting about this prototype is that it seems to be MCM in the sense of disaggregating GCDs not cache which honestly is way harder to do but again this is just a Nvidia test chip vs AMDs actual product and also this one I think but I can't find it explicitly said anywhere is recognized as one GPU unlike CDNA 2 However Nvidia says they won't implement MCM until it becomes cost effective for them to do so You might say that Nvidia is already at that point with their huge dies and that may be right but something to keep in mind is that Nvidia has had a long history of making huge die sizes and their die size now is not really any huge exception to that rule Nvidia is experienced and is aware and has delt with the cost of huge monolithic chips for a while
they would if they tried Idk As you said before Nvidia had consistently used huge dies and so far I don't think they are seeing the need to go any bigger in terms of competition so why go the more complicated design route of MCM Nvidia themselves said they won't move to MCM until they see a cost benefit but alas they are multiple years behind on such technology I don't think this is true Nvidia had working MCM prototypes all the way back in 2018 What's even more impressive is that they disaggregated the compute as well not just cache from compute like RDNA 3 did But as Nvidia doesn't have actual products out in the wild so I would argue that they are still behind but maybe by a year or two considering the MCM AMD has right now is still very impressive but not to tackling the largest challenge of MCM disaggregating the compute tile into multiple chiplets beyond even just two And as much as I don't want to come off as disparaging the work of the engineers of any of these companies I think Intel is actually in the lead of MCM if they get Ponte Vechio out It is disaggregates basically everything all while I'm pretty sure being recognized as one GPU to the OS And Intel is relatively new to the GPU scene and also MCM so if Intel famous for it's bad execution as of late is able to make it work I highly doubt Nvidia can't in a quick time frame especially since they have already been working on it behind the scenes
Assuredly prices change all the time it's just that we haven't seen that behavior work properly in the last two years because of circumstances we are all familiar with I think both manufacturers are still living on the moon and they will see in the upcoming year that all the suggested prices they have in mind are unreasonable and people won't be buying We seeing it with Am5 and we'll see it again
uncompetitive meanwhile Nvidia still outsells AMD on GPUs by like 10 1
Who upgrades consoles every 3 years They are still releasing most games for the PS4 a 9 year old console Every game that released till 2020 Nov was guaranteed to run on the 400 launch PS4 at the time a 7 year old console Someone clearly has never owned a console before but most console gamers do upgrade because as there are newer console there are games that the older one can't play
Idk about everyone else here but I literally need my PC for work and study so if I'm already investing in one it's only a marginal upgrade to add a gaming GPU Vs buying a entirely new system as a console on top of a work pc
Current consoles dont do 4k60 in most cases without cheating with resolution scaling
Console GPUs right now are around 2070S levels Idk what that stacks up to on AMDs discrete side
They can t most games are upscaling from 1440p and these are mostly refreshed old gen games With new games it won t be different but locked at 30 fps this time
I couldn't disagree more I think the price of 7900xtx is much lower than most expected
hardware acceleration is broken on nvidia too
Its going to be slower than the 4090 sure but its still CPU bottlenecked at 1080p and 1440p Look at the numbers they've provided its very close to what 4090 will be doing in 4k So obviously its going to be bottlenecked at lower resolutions where its going to be even faster and have more cache hits and such
Hmm I might have misunderstood but if not then the 700xtx is a much bigger upgrade I would wager something like 4 5x the performance of a 980Ti
New FSR should work on older cards and also on NVidia cards or else there wouldn't be any point to it Navi 32 7800 series should go as high end mobile solution and Navi 31 7700 would be a budget one
Lineups change and it's not like AMD naming has been consistent during the last decade A 60 CU GPU clocked closer to 3GHz should be close enough to the 7900 XT in performance anyway
6900xt is only 10 faster than 6800xt but 250 more expensive 350
I have to laugh every time I see hairworks mentioned I remember people freaking out about it saying it s the next big thing in photo realism and they made such a big stink about it Absolute rubbish Quite frankly so was RT on launch
Personally speaking I wouldnt buy any of the current cards for RT It's just like DX10 all over again By the time their are games where it is a must have feature the cards available will be so much better at RT Or put another way those future RT games are going to murder the current cards so the RT will be largely pointless
Not me It's always a tacked on gimmick to me Could not give less of a shit about RT performance
There's one good use for it for games and another one that can look good but also tends come with a big performance hit that just isn't great Replacing any of the older fake reflection techniques with RT gives a really nice quality boost I would pretty much want RT reflections on all games just for this because the various artifacts of those older techniques are rather annoying and highly perceptible Global Illumination with RT is nice but tends to be more subtle and hits performance
Yup On this subreddit technology only matters if it's either AMD making it or AMD is better at it Anytning else is construed as a gimmick or as useless Look at how often people get shit on here when they say their job needs CUDA you'll inevitably see someone tell them CUDA is useless to 90 of people as if that matters to the person who needs it
Biggest scam in history lmao Dude has never heard of Bernie Madoff apparently
RTRT is claimed to be 50 faster per CU There are 20 more CU's so RTRT performance is expected to be 1 5 1 2 1 8 80 faster at the same clock speeds The only RTRT results they've shown range from 43 faster at the low end to 100 faster at the high end without FSR Adding upscaling it ranges from 38 to 85 Cyberpunk 2077 in particular is shown as being 67 faster without RTRT 62 faster with RTRT and 48 faster with RTRT and FSR
Agreed which is why using OEM's as an excuse for the 7900XT seems really weird AMD has never had a big GPU presence in OEMs prebuilts and unless they plan to heavily invest in establishing a foothold there I doubt it will change in this generation

I m still waiting for my reparations 40 acres and a mule Or I ll take a 7900xtx and we call it even
Im talking about displayport 1 4 which doesnt support framerates higher than 120 at 4k The screen and the card dont matter if the cable is the bottleneck
wrong
If nvidia really wants to keep selling gpus to gamers they need to start investing in something that'll help increase gpu demand Something like vr becasue I see no point in buying a display beyond 4k and compromising my framerates and don't see it as worth it beyond 144hz I see no reason to upgrade beyond this gens top sku ever
6900xt performance with less wattage sounds good in my world
You enjoy not getting raped by greedy corps by buying a card from the greedy corps anyways Really making a bold statement there bud Also really Your example is a 500 burger Maybe you should buy a 90 class card as you don't seem nearly as educated as you seem to think you are
You should also point that the fact that majority of people who buy xx90 class cards also ignore the operational costs energy costs of the said card for the long run GPUs at the apex of the food chain are highly energy inefficient
They've all done this forever Best Buy and Starbucks do this Your grocery store does this They're called decoy products The point is to put one product in such close competition be it a GPU's performance or a coffee's cup size that your 'reasonable' brain will go well we may as well get the bigger one I'm just making these numbers up but for example if a small coffee is 2 a medium is 4 and a large is 4 50 our dumb monkey brains will opt for the large every time Meanwhile the store has earned an extra 0 50 for selling an extra 0 02 of product Obviously the margins are bigger when you're dealing with things like electronics but the idea is the same
Except they're doing it in a way that will actually get cards begrudgingly bought Coughing up an extra 100 as opposed to 400 is something people can be persuaded to do
mb you're right let me check native
Yeah I had the wrong number in my head
I would never choose to natively render 4k over using DLSS or FSR Then i think you're weird I'd never upscale when I can run it natively Upscaling always looks worse than native
Dlss2 maybe but the glitching of the dlss3 is a fuck no I'm not paying that much for that shit
native looks better and always will
It might improve some games but I don't care what it does in benchmarks I want to see real performance not cheaty frames
His post sounds like he doesn't even have a GPU xD Who the fuck wouldn't use FSR or DLSS His comment sounds I heard people with GPUs don't dare to use FSR or DLSS because it ruins their gaming experience and the higher Tier the GPU is the experience is worst wtf
No they're interpolated frames wtf are you even saying lol
Yes I am not talking about rasterization perf I am talking about DXR Raster is not that surprising to see 72 The first OP was talking about 43 58 that's RT level per raster 4090 already does 70ish fps and with DXR it does 41 So in my defense I naturally I assume OPs are talking about the DXR per uplift
this comment shows that you know absolutely nothing about chip design Intel being new to the market did a complete clean slate chip design which has significant advantages right now AMD is in incremental improvements of an existing design They won't get to Clean slate until they design the replacement for RDNA entirely not just 1 vs 2 vs 3
RTX 3080 Ti levels of DXR is very welcome actually It's just a bit underwhelming vs Ada for a gen on gen when AMD are playing catch up RDNA4 plans are already in PoR it cant be changed at this stage AMD can only react for maybe RDNA5
Amd need to invest in dedicated ray tracing core asap No thanks I'll prefer the cheaper card that's good at raster
Yeah It's a trap
So then explain it to me exactly what up to settings means the way you are reading it What exactly are they defining by saying that How does that qualify the results in comparison to one another I'd like a clear breakdown if you are so mentally enabled
yeah from the specs alone I wrote it off already
No it s either max settings or it s not
AMD does not deliver the same If they did then their RT performance would be on par with Nvidia
The one in which this moron wants to wear a tinfoil hat
You can't infer for a card that hasn't come out
my r9 290x just rest forever this month i could go for 6800xt
With how cryptocurrency anf recession going right now Doubt such thing would be a thing for 10 more years Im praying this statement doesn't become a sour milk tho rolling on the floor laughing
And we would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling Nvidias and their 780 Ti
I remember very well when the GeForce 2 Ultra came out at a whopping US
The gt730 is slower than most modern integrated GPUs it's just going to increase your electricity bill So yeah it's pretty much worthless at this point
Bought an R9 Fury for 500 in 2016 Today I would need to spend like 300 just to fucking match it
We don t know the new price yet but I imagine AMD will adjust accordingly
RTX 4070Ti is generally below the 3090 performance and closer to RTX 3080 performance level
They clearly do When the 5600 XT was released Nvidia dropped the price of the RTX 2060 and I think the GTX 1660 as well
He's not crying dude Don't over exaggerate shit for up votes
They designed them both Which part about my reply is confusing to you You are talking about XT and XTX like they are different chips and once production started they saw high yield rates for the XTX AMD will sell as many XTX as they make rest gets labeled XT and fused off but it is the same exact chip
In terms of value you get from the upsell though 4090 is much better than 7900XTX Based on MSRPs and shader counts 4090 upsell get 68 more GPU 16384 9728 for 30 more 1600 1200 7900XTX upsell get 14 more GPU 6144 5376 for 11 more 1000 900 Though the value equation might change if you have to account for fire insurance
Realistically you could have a system with say a Ryzen 5600X or 5800X3D a 6900XT and a 600W or 650W PSU An extra 55W might push that over the limit That is not a realistic scenario for someone about to drop a grand on a graphics card
Or rather the 7700 Series AND the 7800 Series
Hopefully it will beat my 8800 GT by expected 17 letters
If you look at the core count to max core count per die they obviously are 6900XT and 6800XT replacements
it doesnt exactly they are pretty different performance tiers
They didn't have anything high end for quite a few years before RDNA2 and focused only on low end and mid range options so of course there was nothing that expensive Edit excluding Vega and the Radeon 7 but those weren't really high end
355kw 8 kwh 40 52 590 per year I honestly don't see how an entire years worth of difference being only 158 dollars is going to sway anyone If you're worried about 158 dollars of energy in an entire year why are you buying EITHER OF THESE CARDS
What You are going to game for 40 hours a week on full blast There are not even that many AAA games worth playing atm face with tears of joy
40 hours gaming at max power usage per week Who can do that Not even kids going to school have that much free time And if you let your kid game 16 hours a day on the weekend you're a bad parent Also nobody with a 4090 is gaming at 450w nonstop Even when benchmarking mine I couldn't get it to reach those numbers with 4k and anti aliasing More like 300w typical and a lot less if you use vsync Totally overblown problem
The irony of posting this on r AMD skullskullskullskull Vega 56 64
Because benchmarks are usually stock so gotta push that number up that's why raptor lake and zen4 are also to the max Now we only need proper pre tuned ram for some obscene costs so ppl go omgawd it's so much faster than normal ram because ddr5 xmp timings suck and not a lot of ppl tune their ram
Same reason why amd now makes their cpus a hot mess out of the box marketability
It s an enthusiast GPU Are you seriously asking why it should be tweaked The GPU also offers a 600W balls to the wall performance option so it makes sense you can tweak it to be more efficient Why do you want Nvidia to lock it down like Apple that my way is the highway
Because god phorbid you suggest that companies should make a product that benefits the user in general to these zombified goblins on these subreddits Especially on a 1500 msrp product
Because not everyone cares about power draw
It is efficient it's just overclocked out of the box
Tweaking as in pulling a slider slightly to the left Most people power limit undervolt their gpus anyway now
Debauer confirmed this tho
I really hope you are correct the amount of people jumping to buy a 4090 has got me worried Personally I was considering upgrading this generation but the value proposition is not tenable for me Maybe if prices come down a bit over the next year I'll reevaluate
Nvidia outproduces AMD as well
Dsame here I do lile everything on my pc and the aiming with sticks i just dont like So i went also for a gaming pc and its about 2000 able to play 4k but also watching films payments research writing on word play music Sure 2k is a lot foe most ppl and so it is for me But on tje other hand i just keep my midrange phones for atleast 4 5 years instead of buy new iphone every year for 1 5k But i can understand if ppl loke more to pay 500 once and be fine for 5 years with xbox or ps5 4 Tbh the prices are going up way too fast in pc gaming and we should stop to overpay such things like cpus and gpus but everyone thinks he needs a 4090 xD wont get it
Doesn't work like that can't compare amd arch to nivida arch I said 6700xt
You smoking some crack
Yep I think microsoft did something that the GPU manufacturers are trying to fix
Okay clearly you don't understand what I'm saying Nvidia GPU's tax the CPU harder than AMD GPU's This causes Nvidia GPU's to get CPU bottlenecked at a lower fps than AMD GPU's Source v JLEIJhunaW8
For my budget and use case 3440 x 1440p gaming the 6800xt video card at 520 still makes a lot more sense than a 1000 video card that's nearly double the cost even if performance numbers in the real world match what AMD is claiming Availability AIB prices and scalper prices are all very real possibilities to consider here also
I'm a bit sad Hairworks didn't catch on tbh cuz it did look pretty dope despite the huge performance hit
It's a valid point though To the 1 of people who need it go Nvidia To the rest it shouldn't be a relevant feature
to 100 faster at the high end Do you have a link to that benchmark Their best result I've seen claims 60 which is a rounded up number likely from like 57 or so Like all their numbers up to now have been rounded up p 1 p 1 That looks like a 47 6 increase to me with FSR I don't know what the gap is without FSR but I'd imagine it be even smaller since these new GPUs should be like 2 7x as fast at FSR because of all the extra compute A lot of that 47 can be attributed to FSR improvements EDIT it's 62 faster with only RT and no FSR enabled That's odd where are these charts
It's still high end Go look at the steam gpu survey Almost everyone is running 3060 and below performance cards 3080 6900xt and above is still high end even if 4090 is the new king 3080 1 82 3080ti 0 72 3090 0 48 3090ti grouped with other 9 21 6800xt 0 16 6900xt 0 18 6950xt grouped with other 9 21
Yeah I was mostly using those two examples as rather well known instances of specific games pushing performance forward I understand what you are saying but it's a slippery slope The problem with using raw GPU power itself to measure what is high end is that it has no inherent limitation or ceiling Nvidia could release an enthusiast dual chip 1000w GPU tomorrow with double the performance of the 4090 for 4 5k and by the logic you applied above the 4090 would then be a mid or upper midrange card For around a decade and a half high end gaming was defined by the gaming experience provided by the cards available in the 400 700 range give or take for inflation Given the current console performance I think 4k 60 should still be the high end gaming target with enthusiast cards punching a bit above If Nvidia or AMD wants to release enthusiast cards for 1600 2500 that's all fine and dandy but we can't allow them to drag the entire PC gaming market up with them and throw out definitions of performance just so they can realize higher margins On a related note doing exactly that is why we suddenly have a PC gaming market starved for budget oriented cards These out of control halo products have redefined performance segments and pulled the pricing floor up with it
To me high end is something one tier below enthusiast and 7900 XT RTX 4080 seem just that especially how worse the 4080 is compared to the 4090 You missing the guy's point and also contradicting yourself when you said names are irrelevant High end gaming is not determined by the fact that you bought the most expensive GPU on the market it is defined by meeting the relevant performance criteria which when it comes to gaming is basically determined by resolution refresh rate and latency It's not linear not is it infinite High end has a hard ceiling a human eye Only so many pixels and Hz untill it makes no difference Is 8k exclusively a high end gaming now by your logic Or is it even 4k I say if you are gaming on 27 inch monitor 1440p 165Hz is pretty much a hard cap for human eye abilities to distinguish a difference The point is getting a card that can run a game at 600fps vs 240fps will not results in any higher end gaming
Also really Your example is a 500 burger Saw this smoothbrain make the exact same analogy r nvidia comments yrhcyd ivvehvv to me a few days ago and knew the convo was a waste of time Absolutely desperate to portray his lower budget as a moral decision for some reason
Will have to assume you are a troll at this point No decent educated being would respond like that Have a downvote
Yup and not just energy costs but who enjoys their computer room being multiple degrees higher than the rest of the home Or the fact it makes the computer itself noisier dumping all that extra heat Drives me nuts TBH I would never want to exceed 300W GPU Ideally 200 250W
10 feet away 65 inch 4k tv upscaling looks 97 the same as native native just isn't worth it imo
You have a 1440p monitor right DLSS and FSR at lower resolutions like that aren't really comparable to upscaling at 4k and beyond DLSS Quality often looks better than native 4k due to the wonked out TAA and DLSS Balanced often looks the same At least on my display from my viewing distance results may vary of course
Cheaty frames is fsr3 and dlss3 fsr2 and dlss2 are just upscaling I still don't know why nvidia called the frame generation dlss3 and then amd copied that stupid naming scheme for god knows why
Who the fuck wouldn't use FSR or DLSS Me I haven't head the pleasure of playing a game where it's actually good yet F1 game Blurry ghosty mess cars are leaving trails no exaggeration Assetto Corsa Competizione Same as above CoD Blurry af can't see enemies
I wish I was as creative as you so I could also make up whole dialogues for someone I don't even know If you looked at my flair you could see I have a GPU I am playing on 1440p and wouldn't turn it on as long as my GPU can handle games at high fps But that's also why I said preferably you always want to end up with the best results on your screen right
Lol yeah I never understand this chest beating over native resolution I literally see no difference between DLSS Quality and native same goes for FSR The only thing I notice is the higher frame rate Its a no brainer in most cases These people obsessed with native are literally choosing poorer performance just so they can grandstand about not using upscaling
If I put my eyeball up to the screen I can see 3 lower image quality so I rather take a 20 reduction in performance
Who the fuck wouldn't use FSR or DLSS people who give a fuck about image quality
I've seen it I don't like it and won't use it Adding lag to a shooter is a bad time Upscaling is fine but frame generation is a no go for me
AI generated frames used in interpolation are hallucinations It's the professional term used for when AI is fed information and spits out an image So yes They're hallucinations
Ah now I understand where you're coming from and yeah that 43 58 makes no sense otherwise
Y or when 3rd party benchmarks are released Its not a super leap up from what i was considering anyway I wanted to step up a tier from my last card So i was considering the 600 650 price range before recent inflation Inflation adjust that and you are at the 700 800 range I normally skip 1 generation between cards so buying this gen would be normal But I would be generally fine if i skipped a 2nd generation I am both trying to talk myself into it because it would be much faster and out of it because it is still 25 30 more then i wanted to spend it's 50 more if you ignore inflation but that isn't reality Most games I've played over the past 3 years don't even make me want to upgrade no need of more fps But right at this moment i am playing something that makes me want to upgrade Right now I am playing satisfactory with a stupid large build and lately my framerate dropped from the 40 50 i was getting with a large build that was not active down to 10 20 fps with a stupid large build that is active That is making me want to upgrade because spikes under 10 fps is certainly not satisfactory
What exactly are they defining by saying that that the settings are up to How does that qualify the results in comparison to one another what the same games obviously use the same settings but because higher numbers better they're not running completely maxed out settings in all of those games
Okay then it is max settings Glad we're on the same page now
You are purposely inserting criteria in order to prove a point which isn t at issue here Not sure why you want to do this Many many people do not give a single fuck about rt when Nvidia think it is worth such a premium It is not And you are right AMD does not deliver the same performance They actually do better in the areas that matter So there is that But whatever You do you
I am only inferring how AMD typically shows the performance data They always show averages with upto in the graph
I'd just go for a cheap used Rx 580 or 1070 for basic 1080p gaming and wait for January February to buy something market will surely be moving after 7900xtx XT
The Titan cards is what started all this crap
I remember the 8800 gtx gts and ultra debacle too The 8600 didn't even deserve the name and iirc wasn't even as good as a 7800 or close enough to justify it Prices have crept today but same thing
It serves a purpose giving the computer more video outputs
I'm in a similar situation With AMD I would need to spend north of 300 to match my Vega 64 North of 340 if I went with Nvidia The only upgrades around that make some sense are the RX 6700XT or RX 6800 Anything else is just too expensive for the performance upgrade
Man that s brutal They were going for 260 on Amazon a year or so before that Maybe 2 3 years
Eh Depends on game and the rest of the PC a 6500 XT would be enough to match a Fury Certainly for less than 300 There certainly would be cases where a Fury would end up slightly faster also but not by much GCN3 aged really poorly even with NimeZ drivers and using DX12 Vulkan AMD's 2nd worst uArch ever after HD 2000 Mostly crippled by VRAM And by being more expensive and late vs GTX 980
I bought one for 70 recently Exactly the model you have
Yeah looking at my options to upgrade from my Radeon VII Hopefully the prices on these 7000 series remain somewhere in orbit around our planet and don't escape to N
Im waiting for the Sapphire Radeon 7995 Toxic Extreme Titan SUPER Ti XXXtXXX Power MAXXX Hopefully it implements AMD's DLSS3 FSR3 in 2023 and has enough TDP headroom with 4 8 pin power connectors I don't trust that new PCIe power adapter that's been melting the Nvidia cards
I still consider a 800 900 videocard high end regardless if there is a model above it And AMD hasn't released any mid tier options for RDNA 3 so how can it not be highend
7900 XT is above high end definitely lmfao What the hell is this logic High end in my opinion is any gpu that runs newer modern titles at 1440p60 High settings which starts bottoms out at around RTX 2070 Super RX 6600XT Enthusiast gpus I would define as 4k60 High settings which starts around RTX 3080 RX 6800XT Idk what your standards are but if a gpu needs to do 4k120 Ultra settings in order to be high end then something tells me even 4090 won't be enough for you and you probably max out RT and resolution scaling in every game thinking hardware is failing since you're not getting 120 fps at 8k native in Cyberpunk
You say that because you clearly never used any of these cards in a production environment I d have killed to get the sort of performance that these cards provide now back in 2017 when I got my 1070 ti for my first work funded rig
They could have easily NOT dropped their prices and still outsold AMD at an absurd ratio The 3060 alone sold more than the entirety of the rDNA 2 line
It's not exaggerating but the whining is annoying x to x rose 50 bucks what's the big deal about it nobody said anything about 1080ti to 2080ti price hike
I'm confused because my comment implies this already It's commonplace within semi conductor manufacturing to use non top spec dies as lower spec products They designed both the XT and the XTX though they use the same die they are distinct products that required specific designs
They are different chips The 7900XT is a Navi 31 XT core while the 7900XTX is a Navi 31 XTX core The XT is substantially cutdown from the XTX
You still haven't explained what power spikes have to do with anything
I wouldn't look at that and instead look at price performance Which means to wait for more announcements and benchmarks
This It's so obvious the 4090 is head and shoulders above the XTX performance and it's AMD's own fault for setting up that expectation by how they named them Last gen the 6900XT was a direct 3090 competitor and since humans seek patterns they perceive the XTX to be a 4090 competitor making AMD look second rate since their flagship falls so far below Nvidia's
Please there's people doing double that or more Obviously it's not great or healthy but it happens
I play about 50 hours per week 6 hours per day on weekdays and more on weekends I was being generously low at 40 hours I'm married and work full time No kids though And at 300w that's still 500 a year at 40 hours Vsync introduces input lag and is simply just saying well I don't need this much GPU power and at that point you may well have purchased a cheaper GPU since you aren't utilizing it
Not too hard to hit those numbers all you gotta do is play 5 8 hours a day
lmaoo i know I can't with these clowns bunch of armchair lawyers physicists and economists without a shred of a clue
I'm full time employed and phd student And a dog owner Yet could spend 40h week on games with ease So at least your first statement seems not quite correct
R9 moment lol skull and crossbones
How can you say that when AMD is using a fraction of the power EDIT Just realized you were speaking for CPUs not GPUs I wouldn't call Zen 4 a hot mess Ryzen 7000 chips are designed to OC themselves within thermal power limits They don't run too hot Too hot would imply they are running beyond a safe threshold What matters more is how much energy they draw and they do this quite well
Most people power limit undervolt their gpus anyway now Lol you overestimate how technical most people are The average person will just install a component update drivers and call it a day Your everyday man also isn't browsing tech subreddits
Most people dont even know what the difference between mega and gigaherz and gigawatt is Including most gamers Yo bro I have a 2000 gigawatt gpu
Complete opposite of most that s being done by only a few super enthusiast users 99 of people just run out the box not remotely touching anything like that
This is why the price is like that they KNOW enough people will purchase all the stocks for few months on those prices and it's additional profit There is a reason why 7900XTX was not compared to 4090 whatsoever there is no slider that can make it look good even at 1k vs 1 6k price tag As generally for prices it's insane global inflation is insane prices or everything are going up in worrying speed and this is what happens when you print money like no tomorrow in the recent years the effect is seen later now
And you are ignoring the fact that the 7900 XTX is so powerful it will be CPU bottlenecked 1080p and 1440p in many games
This doesn't even a general thing DX11 has way more overhead on AMD and even on DX12 there are games with less overhead on Nvidia Spider Man for example
Oh absolutely paying 1000 or more for a GPU seems kind of crazy to me
This sub was full of data scientists and content creators when the Radeon VII released and Ryzen was faster in multicore Strange how now its a valid point to ignore everything that is not gaming performance It's like we are on a console subreddit
Don't know if there's a first party link to the data but you can find AMD's slides with the numbers I'm talking about here
Market share means nothing in fact no it means something most people barely use midrange stuff at this point since GPUs got so expensive That doesn't mean 4080 is not a high end card and 4090 an enthusiast one
Yeh this guy is insecure as hell Calling people stupid for spending more than what he spent on his gpu here
Oh I can tell you like making assumptions about people that's all you seem to do Also chill with the educated uneducated shtick it makes you look a bit foolish honestly Thanks for the downvote
10 feet away 65 inch 4k tv upscaling looks 97 the same as native and we all know that was play 10 feet away from our displays totally whereas my viewing distance from my 32 monitors and my vision 20 15 I could resolve 8K at that viewing distance easily FSR DLSS do not look as good as native and never will now depending on your FPS it might be worth turning on more stable FPS more noticeable than some image artificacting as FSR and DLSS get really good but they will never be perfect edit checking some visual comparisons Native FSR DLSS
due to the wonked out TAA well of course if you use TAA it'll look like shit and worse than having it off But that's imo the whole point of 4k to not need any AA at all particularly after MSAA just disappeared All images video I've seen comparing them it was easy to tell which is which except for games with TAA on as you say but then I wouldn't play that at native with TAA anyway so it's a non comparison Why anyone would use TAA is beyond me there's literally no positive to it But I'll be playing at 4k when I upgrade my GPU and then revise my opinion but from all the info I have right now DLSS FSR is pretty much of 0 interest to me
Okay that's good to know Then what's the difference between dlss2 and virtual super resolution
Same it's absolute disaster in cod felt like objects in front of me were 2d almost
I understand those who doesn't want to lose visual fidelity but the majority of people use those features because you rather have better performance A guy just responded me that he rather lose 20 FPS than 3 visual effects I got no idea how to respond how the 't use FSR or DLSS because I like pretty pictures xD
My point is you're being disingenuous with the term You're comparing it to a human hallucinating Are hallucinations real Since the word is based off a human experience 1 Even though technically they are real to the observer so that point is moot 2 Hallucinations in that sense aren't controlled for a specific purpose It's like blinking quickly quickly as you walk around and while you're eyes are closed you brain guess what would be there to give you a smooth image if brains had dlss3 It's not fake performance if you can observe and feel it it's real for all intents and purposes And those intents and purposes are to give an equivalent experience to higher frame rates which it does So I don't even know what you're arguing
So you don't know what the settings are then The up to actually clarifies nothing and rather than giving info just poses more questions is that what you are saying So they ran 1 game on one grouping of settings but not another meaning there is no standard among the tests then One test might be run on Max 4k and another on potato settings is that what you want to tell me it means What exactly is the info that up to statement is giving your enhanced mental acuity
It s not max settings unless every graphics option is enabled Disabling RT means it is not max settings
Same year generation released the same day as the 780 Ti Titan 999 780 Ti 699 780 released a month later at 649
FWIW the titan cards used to be deliberately separate from gaming GPUs and offered a lot more enterprise functionality than gaming GPUs complete with bespoke drivers and everything You can argue that the 3090 is the new titan but it lacks the titan nomenclature and the Enterprise drivers It's just a super beefy gaming GPU
That's what you think Nvidia and by extension AMD to a lesser degree will jack up the average selling prices to crypto crazed days The days are of being nice to the consumer are over Now every company everywhere everyday will want to fvck you over Just bend over assume the appropriate position and get your favorite lube ready
A 3050 is 300
I found out about NimeZ drivers today do they make much of a difference
I'd consider this tier of performance and price Enthusiast and above High End in my opinion
high end to me is the flagship and cards close to it aka something like the 3080 Ti 3090 from last gen the 7900 XT is too far off the XTX to be in the same boat it's closer to a regular 3080 from last gen than a TI
Don't be a pussy I need a high end card that can do native 16K at 960fps
Pretty sure during the chip shortage people bought anything they could get their hands on The issue is AMD didn't produce nearly as many RDNA2 products as Nvidia and therefore ran out more quickly
Literally every one did
Your original comment which I replied to implies that the two are a differently designed chip die Example They designed them both and once production started There was only one design The cut down XT is only decided upon once AMD gets to analyze the early XTX production results
It's not a different chip it's the exact same chip with cores fused
The 55w difference in PSU load between the 300w 7900XT and 355w XTX is negligible unless we're talking about large transient power excursions and low quality PSU's If you don't think your PSU can handle a non spikey 7900XTX you shouldn't be pairing that PSU with a 7900XT either
But they're not the norm lol that's the point If you're gaming 80 hours a week uh you kinda deserve the bill you get at the end of the month That's a level of privilege that shouldn't come free
So you never hang out with your wife
If you only play games that don't fully utilize the GPU with vsync on then I agree But not all games have equal performance Heck I can't even maintain 60fps with everything set to decent levels on the latest games while it's only using 70 in others and capped at 60fps And vsync only introduces noticeable lag if you're playing on a 60Hz screen On a 144Hz screen it's not that bad I reckon
You are not the norm sorry guy but you're not Majority of people working fulltime enrolled in school don't have the time to responsibly play 40 hours a week nevermind 50 That's whack Vsync introduces input lag Whatyearisit jpg Get VRR and you will literally not have any added input lag from it This has been researched and proven countless times over the last 5 years since G Sync came out If you're buying a 1000 graphics card you should have VRR on your monitor by now Lastly if you only upgrade once every few years it's better to buy an overkill card today so tomorrow you are still gaming comfortably It's why my 1080 Ti lasted me nearly 6 years I expect my 4090 will do the same
That is an insane amount of gaming for an average person lol
Maybe AMD also knows their gpus don't scale well past the 300w mark so they resigned themselves to be the 'power efficiency king' for out of the box performance rather than be an energy slog and still be worse than a 4090 Saves them some money too from not having to make 4 slot coolers themselves
If they can figure out how to DIY plug a GPU in and buy the correct PSU wire in the connectors etc I'm sure they can figure out drag a slider to the left 4090 ain't for OEM since OEM skimps too hard on psu and cooling
If the 4090's theoretical fps is 200 but the CPU bottlenecks it at 150 then the framerate is 150 If the 7900XTX's theoretical fps is 175 and the exact same CPU bottlenecks at 180 due to less driver overhead then the framerate is 175 In this scenario the 4090 is CPU bottlenecked at 150fps and the 7900 XTX is GPU bottlenecked at 175fps using the same CPU
sub was full of data scientists and content creators when the Radeon VII released No it wasn't It didn't get particularly good feedback from the majority of people Ryzen was faster in multicore I mean after 5 6 7 years of basically no progress from Intel you can't blame people Strange how now its a valid point to ignore everything that is not gaming performance It's like we are on a console subreddit Shock horror dominant form of use case is most talked about and relevant to those in the sub
Yeah that's the post I went looking for and was just looking at That's definitely a bit odd but lines up more with AMDs 50 80 claims Thanks
most people barely use midrange stuff at this point That's exactly what they do Top 14 3080 is 15 1060 2060 3060 3070 1660 3060ti 1660S 1660Ti 1070 makes up 33 72 1650 1050Ti 1050 3050 makes up 14 And 1 laptop gpu I ignored If anything people just hold on to their older gpu rather than upgrade because of the insane gpu prices But 3050 3060 3060ti 3070 all beat 3080 by a large margin Well except 3050 that barely eeks ahead of the 3080
I didn't say upscaling was perfect I said that the perceived 3 in image quality loss was not worth the massive performance decrease I could sit anyone down in my living room and I would surprised if even 2 people could tell the difference You're pixel peeping
As someone that plays at 4k TAA is still needed for a lot of modern games There are some games that look like shit without TAA with jaggiesand texture shimmering etc The idea that 4k doesn't need AA was more true back when MSAA was the prevailing AA type
Virtual super resolution if you mean the driver toggle in the AMD control panel is the exact opposite rendering at a higher resolution and downscaling it With DLSS 1 2 and FSR 1 2 you render at a lower resolution and do some clever upscaling to make it as unnoticeable as possible DLSS 3 and likely FSR 3 as well inject frames that their algorithm rendered inbetween the normal frames to make things look smoother
So It's 1600 bucks I'm not giving that kind of money to a GPU I can afford it easily it just seems like a silly thing to do for me
I'm not comparing it to anything That's the literal technical term in computer science for ai generated frames
all raster games were run at 4k max settings it says it right in the graph
Jesus who pissed in your cereals stop being fucking dense
Every single graphics option IS enabled that is for rasterization performance
pretty sure 780 was released before 780ti
6600 is 200
Between a bit to possibly tremendous difference such as Halo Infinite becoming playable You can play modern games that require modern drivers you can get increased performance in stuff you can use ReBar SAM you can tweak Delta Color Compression ratio for potentially improved performance or reduced VRAM Absolutely try them x200B Try them Also try the FSR2 mod if you haven't already
Curious what price bracket do you consider highend and Enthusiast
So positional based on marketing rather than actual performance in the average game you play
Literally everyone who did ended up buying now if people did what they did for the 4080 12g y'all would of have these high prices to begin with
Two different products require different designs there's more to a video card than simply the silicon even if they use the same chip In any case this conversation is pointless since it's based on you misunderstanding my original comment
Almost 20 of a 600W PSU is not negligible PSUs built to the lastest ATX standard can handle spikes of up to double the rated power for short periods this applies to even lower wattage mid range PSUs not just high end ones Also spikes are typically supplied by capacitors and monitored by control and protection ICs and are not a part of the normal power rating or components that supply most of the nominal power Edit also components can exceed their nominal maximum for fractions of a second as it's heat build up and efficinecy loss that partially limit a PSU components capability and heat built up is not a factor for tiny fractions of a second which is how long transitents last
She had her own PC so she'd prefer not being disturbed
We just game in the same room together And watch some anime from time to time It works well for us
I mean there's people gaming with their partners
VRR prevents when below your monitor refresh rate Vsync prevents flickering from being above your refresh rate They actually don't interact at all You need to use a frame rate limiter below your monitor refresh rate which if not in game engine adds input lag to avoid hitting your refresh rate in the first place They're actually mutually exclusive technically though that works seemlessly by switching back and forth
Lots of people specially kids can easily hit that number
5 6 hours is nothing lol Especially on your days off and on the weekend if you don't work weekends
To each their own but I absolutely love their approach to GPUs and would have done the same thing They stomp all over Nvidia when it comes to balancing price size practicality efficiency connectors DisplayPort etc
Yes and both are CPU bottlenecked Congrats you've figured out why they aren't showing 1080p and 1440p benchmarks but showing it at 4k instead
I thought we were talking about CPU bottlenecks so that's the best way to showcase this Same thing happens at 4K but there's just less of a CPU bottleneck Like the source you gave is of two PS4 ports at 1080p medium settings What a way to self own Did you even watch the video Of course if you move to 4K ultra there's no difference as the bottleneck vanishes Of course it's cherry picking That's the point when I show that there are games where the opposite is true so the conclusion that Nvidia always has more overhead is wrong That's how you refute a hypothesis
3 in image quality loss 3 is a meaningless value here it's not rigorous You're pixel peeping I have sharp vision and one of my hobbies is photography I've been gaming since the 90s as well Visual artifacting sticks out to me and I can easily perceive the visual difference between Native FSR and DLSS looking at video comparisons now if i was doing 30 fps it would probably be worth it to turn them on if it got me 60fps stable The better framerate being worth the trade off in that case but if i'm already getting 60 stable then i'll keep them off 60 stable native 120 stable FSR 120 stable DLSS
hmm what's your monitor size and what distance do you sit from it I'm fairly close to mine so am going for a 24 4k monitor I still preferred playing with jaggies and shimmers at 1440p than using TAA though The blurriness is really uncomfortable to me
You stepped away from the technical term once you asked if they were real Are the hallucinations on your screen real No shit of course they are This isn't philosophy it's data science
Tell that to the other guy winking face
That s still not every graphics option Lol
It's actually about 3 months newer I thought it was released in March 2013 but actually was May 2013 780 Ti was February
Still more than it should cost to match a 7 year old card The graphics card market is fucked no matter how you look at it
Thanks might tide me over until I upgrade Hopefully to a 7700 xt if the pricing is reasonable
I thought about this throughout the years I'd say I don't know I think ever since HD5000 really 5850 5870 class of GPUs are enthusiast 5830 5770 were high end because they matched 4870 and 4890 and so on If not then maybe GTX 700 era Like 680 770 were high end 780 and 780 Ti where enthusiast class 280X 7970 was high end 290 290X was enthusiast That's how I've been seeing it anything When I bought my 5700 XT in 2019 I considered it high end being in the Radeon 7 1080 Ti 2070 2070S 2080 range while 2080 Ti being Enthusiast
Positional based on the best one available at that time yes Nobody needs more performance than a 2060 super so anything is high end by that definition
This conversation is indeed pointless it's not me misunderstanding anything here but your incorrect understanding of how cut down chips are made Now you are sidestepping to product
Almost 20 of a 600W PSU 55 600 is 9
I don't actually play many games with her but I do often play games in the same room and I use open headphones so I can hear her clearly She's more of a console single player jrpg fan
Buddy please update your knowledge on VRR It sounds like you're missing out on the smoothest lowest input lag gaming you can possibly have
If you think that is normal for anyone but a kid on a school 't know what to tell you
This isn't on days off and on weekends It's every day for an entire year straight 99 99 of gamers don't do this
Yes and both are CPU bottlenecked No in the scenario I just spelled out the Nvidia GPU is CPU bottlenecked The AMD GPU is not If you think they're both CPU bottlenecked you don't know what a CPU bottleneck is Don't bother arguing any further
Lmao why are we wasting our time in this conversation we aren't going to change each other's mind Play without upscaling and I'll keep playing with upscaling do what makes you feel happy man
Most people aren't you For a large portion of the population they wouldn't even know what to look for in upscaling artifacts so in almost every use cases upscaling is just better in every way
I don't see how you arrived at that conclusion A stupid purchase is a stupid purchase even if it doesn't affect you I don't need a koala so I'm not buying one My finances don't affect that decision
Up to probably mean the fps you can expect with the system they used I just compared their 6950xt numbers to 3rd party reviewers 6950xt numbers and can confirm that amd is indeed using avg fps
