lol oh geez fuck
motherboard online setup guide Stick qr code mb day
sticker foam right
People want verify smart assume know
motherboard like A1 B1 like A2 b2 Intel think matter know people RAM problem Ryzen fix slot manual tell use
happen lot people know
imagine reason inefficient impossible despite sound like simple solution
tell dual quad channel design require specific trace design layer motherboard pcb make multivalent design like design ethernet card automatically detect cross patch cable connect mean swap single pin inside connector require add level complexity RAM CPU interface design degrade performance and or increase cost talk datum exchange timing order magnitude nanosecond small adjustment enormous impact oh trace cm long happen congratulation ram latency double
length layout trace mater complicate design benefit bad performance
important rip table training time DDR5 stick need install clear cmos second GB RAM instal boot bootup take long not worry
short answer yes well dimm channel instead
color code cheap
board use t topology layout memory trace slot use matter slot physical wire length slot cpu exceedingly rare board use daisy chain slot advertised memory speed print motherboard box possible slot close cpu short trace slot away perform long trace length
design like compromise workaround trigger run slow
possible sheer number control impedence trace DIMM cpu connect pin cpu
call dimm slot instead
likely require sort multiplexer pin jumper channel trace incredibly robustly engineer probably introduce signal noise increase impedance resistance trace introduce new component fail like head impossible likely costly worth consider alternative right slot lol
let use slot instead slot sure upset
think possible exist
circuit pathway connect connect want signal path instead turn path turn path path cross path need switch memory channel path need switch DIMM add complexity reason
board prohibitively expensive RAM trace significant motherboard design complex weird stuff add
remember game come physical thick manual story game info yeah manuaslare worth read
YouTube video need untill reach need plug panel connector motherboard label connector board case panel connector contain need manual
think device manual nowadays annoying tutorial start
pc come manual joke aside literally motherboard manual check port usb3 have lean pc look motherboard motherboard motherboard
exactly coast thing grab manual mess verify Lego click
sure noob idiot read manual compensate lack knowledge take barely effort make entire process easy
knowledge yes easy mess stuff
prefer use tape pull residue
boot time plural boot time feature bug
assume sticker like easy remove normal human external tool talk warranty warranty lawyer care care piece sticker fairly easy remove cause butthurt people spend untold time hobby people board sticker
know pin inside slot right probably shove RAM right sticker work
hard minute hot rinse cycle dishwasher care
Naah reseat cpu cool reach clip lazy plus favorite build

insane happy e waste
time Hyundai own subsidiary catch child labor sheet metal stamping plant lol
People forget Ford GM lie hide know fault cost thousand people life year Kia audacity american try improve
mention theft issue bad idea right especially live big city
hire BMW M division head n model remember hyundai tuscon like know quality pretty good price buy yaris GR afford rivian p
confirm lease Hyundais faulty brake fully replace early life faulty engine completely replace discover tech routine oil change buddy entire steering column replace lease Hyundai vehicle look nice build quality suspect
year increase quality
probably peel gently rip like ham fiste goofball

try Hawaii previous generation result current situation frame pacing blower cooler ahem hairwork rtx h 264 low bitrate encoding tout nVidia adjacent medium blogger need gamer
time AMD roll graphic card people stick nvidia card bc know Best luck AMD honestly like fight Intel fanboy entrenched
greedy lol think understand work market go pay pay AMD price high give recent market trend understanding luxury item sell way sell past budget gpu likely year late perform release version depend release pricing sell hire employee think pay
People want cheap AMD buy cheap Nvidia AMD stupid feed undercutting circle hate want hard truth XT bad price wise country grab pessimism prove right
computer house yeah puppy set bit computer house
pretty sure monitor oled panel Freesync love current monitor Gsync wrong like happy way NVIDIA go good opportunity AMD little aggressive partially go AMD meantime
AMD desecrate goodwill accumulate buyer short term profit AMD course
gpu cheaper buy Nvidia gpu lower price compete
not matter AMD price card people buy Nvidias shit buck like 6600xt vs 2060S reskin aka
lol type post everytime Nvidia raise price like people want competition buy Nvidia cheap People bring lhr
lol stupid post amd order certain wafer form TSMC gpus year half ago process node not possibly sell time node probably book increase wafer count go to long time kid understand ic manufacturing work long take
RX fucking dumb
DP2 0 RX card competition not
innocent post production capacity easily change max price sell production
price gpu maximize profit look Steam hardware share small percentage people people buy line card rich go share literally 1 ers small ti majority consumer buy tier high tier incentive price war majority gamer game increase share people buy budget gpu sale New gen budget gpu month release majority gamer actually buy
know upcoming gpu performe pretty good know produce trh Navi2X card good performance price ratio save pc gaming effect people buy Nvidia want break adoption rate Desktop system good chance sure AMD buy certain allocation TSMC cpu gpu series price product accordingly exact profit possible AMD friend not buy stuff afford difficult concept
Nvidia customer say AMD poors LMAO
nah reality people want AMD compete Nvidia lower price buy Nvidia GPU people want imho AMD price competitively low high
buy 6900xt 5800x year ago good purchase half issue super performance incredible FPS 1440p Modern Warfare render resolution speak software way smooth easy clean look program need nvidia NVENC Nvidia selling point eye edge AMD win long time ago Nvidia Intel sleep r d DLSS FSR look sell point sadly people scared change instance Windows amazing people scared switch
sad truth AMD lower price nvidia follow y buy nvidia
AMD ok 75 100 cheap Nvidia guy happy cheap
AMD exist Nvidia monopoly break law government take control greedy guarantee AMD marketshare will Nvidia remain control market rdna3 will cheap compete product low price segment Nvidia charge
AMD money server market choose Nvidia

highly doubt percent difference like gen Nvidia NVENC CUDA etc
November come Lisa come stage show graph show 7900xt matching rasterization price Lisa thank watch walk mic drop
forgive AMD collapse cryptocurrencie especially noticeable low end Nvidia cut price sell RTX RX people happily buy
stupidity greedy consumer friendly business real factor profit need calculation prediction habe route promise profit duty shareholder think profit face legal trouble
time will not money win gamer heart
People want performance AMD deliver well performance rasterization change matter Nvidia charge absolutely batshit
probably downvote people comment claim AMD par Nvidia far truth mention RTX DLSS driver support probably bad year bug month year fix overall performance 3d accelerate productivity task blender lag far Nvidia maybe play computer look closely metric probably will real difference recur issue lack support support hardware lead switch AMD Nvidia time year valid reason people continue buy Nvidia AMD

AMD want good board partner video card AMD listen negotiate price flexibility give board partner build video card Nvidia AMD gpu board partner want AMD card price relate combination faithful Nvidia customer money buy Nvidia card regardless performance capability allow remain Nvidia card sellable Radeon RX XT devastate geforce RTX example board partner retailer need pricing RX XT allow RTX 4090s board partner build sufficiently sell return investment retailer manufacturer rightfully angry Nvidia noncompetitive price Nvidia card similar sentiment AMD able undercut Nvidia render RTX inventory unsellable money retailer Nvidia money retailer go retailer pay manufacturer product pay Nvidia part order retailer break Nvidia refund product chain price drop exist inventory retailer manufacturer end sell loss especially price set Nvidia contract
stupid people buy 2k dollar 3080 1 5k dollar ps5s prove product sell high price people buy sure hope amd doent greedy foolish company learn year people pay price price nvidia people want scalped nvidias
AMD need undercut significantly sort difference let assume go GB buy come DLSS superior raytracing capability price point people spring dollar question
AMD screw opportunity narrator
plan cpu 6700xt build hold gen AMD gpu reasonably price power efficient available soon 7700xt instead
interested think find niche market go saturate
expect nvidia board gpu instead get increase increase rebrande
maybe like Jay cent video keep market manipulate Nvidia CEO say correct supply demand certain level price high
remember Nvidia launch GTX slash price dollar well expect performance way well performance dollar remember end love
end sure matter low mid range end pricing go massive issue Nvidia AMD compete console people include simply justify spend console graphic card AMD win short term way course long term healthy graphic card sale
leapfrog NVIDIA Intel medium engine go AMD NVIDIA encode 8k60 minimum want thing like 4 2 2 hardware encode decode bandwidth high resolution framerate happen buy AMD
yes AMD not pci e X4 gpu
hmm know sure AMD get taste greed Crypto boom happen combination GPU shortage Nvidia AMD pretty printing money
see Nvidia deliberately price new card outside realm sanity encourage people buy generation card fill warehouse decide price match manage sell absolutely exactly kind play expect AMD point
Linux user agree stable option Wayland lol
actually root AMD hope will swing customer way Nvidia day ago slap unjustified price hike TSMC increase chip price mean pay imo fool GB disguise nail FSR good DLSS wave goodbye Nvidia look wait long upgrade look like join team red soon
friendly reminder use fab chipset RAM pretty
reasonable price mind TSMC increase price overall expect cheap gpus sure expensive TSMC cost die AMD ridiculous die size performance ratio

ready disappoint ready disappointed
time invest
negative thought Nvidia price rtx4070 rdna3 card barely beat rtx4070
price gpu decently think go Supply lot profitable laptop gpu lot profitable go limited wafer capacity focus left go allocate gpus make sense economically
truly believe AMD continue dabble GPU market purely duopoly alive leave Nvidia truly monopoly check place happen far force competitor duopoly stay involved

venture amd time past find driver stable overall nvidia general similar experience
good streaming encoder n gold
wall street hold beer
maybe 7900xt slow buy probably low power
create compete DLSS look like muddy mess DLSS easily big reason RTX card
honestly release RDNA2 desktop apu decent price easily increase adoption desktop market have OEMs price small pc allow push tdp like 60w easily good 1080p gaming medium setting pricetag total small computer like go laptop space way price series OEMs put expensive laptop dedicated graphic make absolutely sense want money bean counter decide adoption rate needle
guy mad card raise price bit Taiwan chip manufacturer raise price AMD play card right fuck affordable card

7900xt lesgo
Nvidia launch sign AMD competitive come round company practially transparent
Amd low price cpu use market share
excuse switch AMD gpu
small efficient cheap card Day buy trust AMD see opportunity
unfortunately AMD plan GPU supply bake mean highly unlikely market share year maybe year class low card come nm wafer think shot take market share expect pricing relief AMD undercut open question give competitive expect gen
AMD Intel swipe huge chunk market share Nvidia relatively easily price gpu
unlike Nvidia AMD make boatload money sell cpu hope undercut Nvidia gpu drive cpu sale
annouce release new gpu market Nov preview card selve
get Ryzen year ago decent gpu low price consider straight buy
problem depend bunch thing AMD gpu satisfy demand cpu epyc mobile wafer start gpu flood market people buy hand 6xxx card little demand 7xxx card case desperate performance upgrade like Nvidia decide gouge normal buyer go buy hand card minimise revenue loss desperate 7xxx card charge double hope AMD price incredibly unimpressed price lately hell Zen price imo absolute trash Zen price normalised Zen core Zen core cheap core talk Zen cheap core node drop core core optimistic
access N4 nm process Nvidia way offer compelling product
yes give good great sub dol card buy want RX AV1 enconde support
unit sell instantly stupid greedy
AMD card fuck launch go to sure
literally own graphic card EVGA go year ago GTX ti build brand new pc month plan beginning 7800x3d EVGA EVGA pull say maybe Asus MSI go wait AMD offer see Nvidia offer keep get AMD GPU ball AMD court right thing price wise solid offering time Intel Nvidia PC
easy unfortunately wafer deal tsmc year advance look today news mean AMD lock supply production volume fraction NVIDIA produce rdna3 mop floor Lovelace limit card demand high simply cause retailer raise price regardless margin AMD charge card good easily end expensive NVIDIA
think see plan rdna3 basically mirror Ryzen rich quick scheme wild price swing execute deliver competitive product slight price increase generation ensure good margin fast fast close cheap potentially expensive msrp Nvidia mess make product match market super fast expensive build rdna3 go cheap build hopefully highly competitive
hope gpu well power requirement 450W nvidia comfortable run hope amd good GPU 350w low 1000w psu silent model
want AMD function opengl driver definitely buy gpu like buy multiple AMD cpu know currently work problem hold breath
save pc gaming imagine buy console instead pc
issue amd lower price nvidia lower price people buy nvidia anyways
percent team green EVGA buyer gaming life consider ATI AMD card AMD close reasonable price money soon find
AMD card match Nvidia 3090ti
depend offer pure raster performance cut anymore people wpuld adopt rdna way AMD lack quality encoder streaming quality massively handicapped ray trace performance bell whistle like AI feature streamer Amd need gen force nvidia price war personally trade 3080ti 6900xt plus got pay 250usd extra nvidia gpus valuable asia regret decision driver issue generally bad performance allot indie survival title old graphic mode game ray trace par brother 3060ti
problem price performance terrible user experience largely software issue
great AMD amazing people not buy bad stigma reduce pricing compare NVidia open people buy ultimately improve brand vision respect
buy RX xt virtualization light computing AMD fix driver start support people increase adoption currently people want use devices even Windows run issue driver stability instal official driver indication effort AMD fix issue
agreed AMD gpu year recently buy 7900xt feel good
expectation low holy fuck thing
yep price increase skus Nvidia g rebrande xx70 die real AMD way easily stomp gain real market share have big margin
decide undercut Lovelace card lose shit Series literally major production cost advantage Lovelace excuse AMD tell Nvidia importantly fanboy Radeon choice MOTHERFUCKIN choice gpu generation time AMD throw debate performance dollar goddamn window gain market share far well long term strategy reap benefit year maxxe margin month
thing know cost assume gouge stuff expensive limited right surprise op mention performance price ratio idea guy stuff expensive maybe performance moon AMD sure stupid lot go say hope come brainer guard
publicly trade company sue good interest shareholder yay capitalism
happy cake day
Nvidia level greedy word GB sad joke
happy discrete gpu market share winking face with tongueface with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughinggrinning squinting face

high end gpu monolithic advantage nvidia
use Sapphire manufacture reference card assume final price negotiation profit
real know price agreement TSMC
wonder Nvidia pay pull stunt year try extort TSMC threaten follow go samsung
question wafer price allocation AMD sure bet suddenly GPU market negotiate wafer TSMC make useless AMD undercut nvidia supply demand generate
AMD waste half CU core space tensor core like Nvidia Ada literally double performance die area Nvidia cost
course greedy nature remember raise price Ryzen remove box cooler drop good chunk cost HSF material box size shipping storage space likely loooot shipping weight saving increase pricing tell buy cooler
hard undercut card time popular choice market Nvidia People afraid amds driver people want DLSS RTX undercut will money
amd get slightly well pricing Navi efficient cost effective produce Ada yield Navi well way well architecture allow effective usage give waffer overall amd gpu cheap cool use way power Ada Amd dominate market share price gpu aggressively Gen amd king dominate performance
probably will buy new power supply new AMD card sayin
AMD large company want exploit market good ability like player stupid hope look Ryzen generation ie arguably good product available price aggressively gain mindshare Ryzen generation know competition competitive price tier creep delay release well bang buck sku like 5700x late possible moment personally think AMD need moment continue establish mindshare need provide product hit metric price performance stability software support generation people start look competitive advanced nVidia take cpu Intel similar opportunity Intel give window release like nm chip row make little progress generation nVidia give window absolutely absurd produ stack pricing bit gpu label wtf
thing people not consider corporate espionage Nvidia likely know s performance AMD upcoming stuff price accordingly
r hardware see poster talk great AMD 5700xt reasonable price happy result Nvidia drop price buy 2060s reasonable price annoyingly large people want AMD competitive Nvidia cheap buy Nvidia gpu
addition proprietary thing market DLSS NVENC PhysX day People feel like miss AMD Nvidia get thing AMD implement open source tech
accurate post dumb embarrassingly ignorant RX6000 extremely well performance dollar grant ship problem AMD developer can t won t wrong Nvidia AMD advertise card correctly combine mindshare dumb consumer base professional thoroughly brainwash AMD simply situation fault people like op feel like Nvidiabot plant
time core gamer care gaming literally use NVENC Cuda nvidia broadcast etc feature add considerable value likely reflect resale value AMD considerably cheap Nvidia comparable unit gamer describe plan use card end life sell upgrade year unfortunately entirely emotional logical decision AMD GPU thing realistically compete price love nvidia hate usually have high raw performance absolutely demolish AMD software feature casually want stream example real alternative nvidia significantly bad experience configuration example thing need Cuda machine learning etc FWIW hate celebrate think people need real AMD need hear AMD make GB equivalent equal real world performance exact price unfortunately objectively stupid purchase situation
sound like Nvidia drop price tho margin thin AIBs AMD good position cost production serie increase AIBs well margin undercut Nvidia lot wait review thing sure buy Intel go AMD Intel wow gen bad
Jensen take huge dump NVIDIA mindshare follow consensus r NVIDIA
blower cool 290X fuck trash lets honest
hey happen Hairworks Tomb Raider witcher

secret ingredient corporate propaganda
AMD great generation past 9700pro RX480 extremely competitive gpu price right gamer embrace happen super recently certainly completely agree op undercut Nvidia win heart Ada gpu huge expensive produce AMD screw Nvidia wall gen hope
time late Cyberpunk special RT mod nuke performance non rtx40 card make visual difference Digital Foundry claim good thing god invent oxygen completely ignore old Nvidia AMD card rush store buy RTX40
choice similarly price product feature rich obvious drawback pick option
thing mention valid point Nvidia get AMD NVidia simply invest mainly software feature fact
Tbf work area u basically need nV product amd give shit ue unity workload HLSL developement
encoding work give fuck hairwork blower cooler horrible AMD Nvidia use anymore guess thing leave AMD RTX game promise Radeon RX7000 let go
tout nVidia adjacent medium blogger pretty lame way try dismiss lot valid complaint maybe AMD well
great example AMD steadily gain cpu marketshare Intel simply kill DIY market
People stick Nvidia objectively well product long list advantage situation intel think slowly change go to price difference sway people away
fair constantly hear bad AMD driver experience amd card Vega constantly crash want support amd Vega headache
nVidia fanboy EVGA head door I Fingers cross Team Red
significantly undercut Nvidia people buy Nvidia like previous gen People argue small premium Nvidia worth right
true Nvidia actually room lower series price rumor believe RDNA lot cheap produce Ada probably undercut bit maintain decent margin price difference convince gamer leave Nvidia ecosystem different story
People want cheap gpu consumer fanboy buy compelling product offering AMD simply match Nvidia price performance go capture market share maybe goal grow GPU division remain static know strategy grow need differentiate competition term price performance Ryzen strategy RDNA2 type offering will cut long supply constrain market
plan thing nvidia plan produce series plan replace previous gen produce anymore compete series series compete series performance increase price profit compete series think sell lot series compete nvidia series replace price series people buy nvidia
6700xt nitro 420 right probably good value atm
depend feature offer raw speed Nvidia damn impressive ray trace dlss promise AMD lot compete need charge right want cheap AMD cheap Nvidia AMD way competitive go wait Nvidia drop price
ole useful clamp color space srgb accurately depict color extended color range color manage application like game poor color reproduction clip color space look right complicated fully understand basically artist give image set color manage program like Photoshop color profile calibrate monitor image vibrant realistic way monitor display color extend color spa e oled support despite color match eye human configure thing like game look tweak photo srgb space people view content srgb space image design inside srgb tell wide gamut monitor display stretch color dull red real life look dull red srgb clamp monitor look bright neon red wide gamut monitor extended color space yes accurate show color will not match reality close clamp srgb bit wide gamut monitor day research answer use amd driver clamp output srgb monitor display color outside srgb effectively content find accurately use color space
buyer vast majority buy Nvidia AMD offer fast product yes yes happen time past likely
nvidiots low rdna3 price amd buy x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B rtx4000 reasonable price
gain market mind share maximize long term profit
increase market share step
bleed customer today Nvidia claim tomorrow People need stop get marketing game understand business current fiscal year Nvidia want bleed customer dry signal future plan need cash maybe figure later lose significant market chunk stupid make bad public knowledge
absolutely price rx msrp stable correct inflation high radeon market share profit ecosystem well optimization developer see marketing future brand order tsmc capacity fall price matter time anyways honest nvidia raytracing proprietary ecosystem advantage matter buyer
valid point mean op frame badly greedy vs stupid market share argument long term AMD benefit have presence market offer compelling price way achieve matter projection base production capacity past performance
AMD release card performance price NV possibly expect people buy AMD price perf choice NV low perf NV competitive price choice likely NV perf low price obvious choice AMD
AMD publicly trade company know maximize profit face repercussion overlord capitalism demand capitalism demand consumer power money capitalism not defend company defend customer give excuse company fair capitalism right good demand money
not dominant theory Freeman stakeholder theory right year ago shareholder theory dominant
manage company work differentiate product sell say product grow business investor content current performance expect growth like investment grow AMD market leader GPU space shock shareholder oppose strategy increase market share extension long term financial performance AMD lose money sell product return product sell low margin grow business take lead market term performance mind share raise price Ryzen strategy example
downvote argument market day trade forward look statement AMD produce price competitor undercut Nvidia perform close card forward look statement point view AMD claim aim build sustainable market share increase quarter quarter work boost AMD share price earning bumper profit day
tis sell 6900xt max point AMD unfortunately AMD cpu Ryzen average consumer ignore pc nvidia graphic
usually buy Nvidia case
probably personally recent year feel Nvidia worth small hundred dollar price premium DLSS well driver quality FSR2 DLSS2 long major competitive advantage DLSS3 remain see
yeah lot people refuse believe AMD card perform counterpart cheap true driver wonky usually good
NVidia card value way better driver well upscaling DLSS well RT performance well performance professional CUDA etc
RTX LETS GOOOO BABY smiling face with sunglassessmiling face with sunglasses
forget 6900xt shortage people buy 6900xt price people buy
maybe EU problem forget actual price AMD Nvidia card price history PowerColor Radeon RX 6900xt Europe Estonia take year close msrp gladly buy 6900xt msrp remotely close go pay price old card wait AMD disappoint cheap 6900xt 3080ti
sadly agree time DLSS nice feature
AMD mindshare change past year
depend performance
mentality company make absolute fast product able bring performance people normally like car company
People buy 3080 mining craze
funny people buy 3060 buck upwards
people buy 3070s buck instead 6900xt
median income high price area like California get 6800xt certainly rich eat lot expense people draw simply hobby different put money aside make time people hobby personal decision
convince need stuff
Nvidia focus cater AI ML market leave retail gaming market AMD handle
time people be buy old rtx series stock new rdna3 long match price performance
close cheap current gen 1800aud vs fast 6900xt 1000aud lol premium
anti monopoly law extend functional monopoly duopoly player market functionally monopoly legally keep player government reach
yep worry pr allocate expensive wafer gamurr card print money make Zen chiplet margin massive CPU brand value software stack place GPU fat margin like Nvidia
mindshare great marketing nVidia
debatable gb true die past course compare series massive downgrade think focus gb scam ignore massive gap CUDA core core gap crazy
rare people like understand fact Nvidia market corner way place gaming sell gpu gamer probably hold majority market share vast workload Nvidia gpu handle easily AMD struggle outright abysmal business enterprise shit increase pricing know get good work AMD good thing rasterization love buy AMD GPU purely game majority market share mindset despite hardware surveying show vast majority gamer run Intel Nvidia tremendous actually AMD barely race downvote want fanboye speak publicly accessible fact edit actually hope AMD steer away single minded outlook GPU performance frame win game know Nvidia slogan amd large focus mindset want hand real money competition AMD come card kill rasterization sweep Nvidia rug category people look Nvidia change tune happen RDNA3 sadly
People want performance afford AMD deliver rasterization performance level sane consumer option hell AMD capture shitty worth section
completely valid mention nvidia broadcast feature plus new card dual av1 encoder perfectly valid reason raster perf buy nvidia card AMD

think nVidia card expensive CUDA provider town pay man video card gamer require CUDA function
switch RDNA2 6800xt year exclusively NV card will card summer buck possible Ampere card level raster performance driver ui well stream line AMD issue far
AMD fool undercut hard nVidia retaliate low price eventually AMD lose money market share gain time test fact previous generation
video card buyer use CUDA feature shop video card argue online incredible CUDA core actually know use lol nVidia marketing force

AMD subredding dramatically misunderstand rebrand mean rebrande exist undoubtedly card call point card Nvidia announce week previously direct buy RTX call rebrand leaker pull bullshit arsis rebrand 800W power requirement
think shareholder agree
need undercut nVidia 150 300 nice instance AMD past decade afford seriously undercut nVidia time happen major success
want card sound like architecture name porn star yes know actual LOVELACE PORN star shares
undercut barely nvidia price ludicrous
shareholder absolutely want chance company gain market share upset exist customer profit unit way achieve good interest surely AMD chance ryzen2 moment time Nvidia
sort urban legend yes sue good interest shareholder sue good interest shareholder sue alien planet Krypton sue stop unlikely sue successfully general long board director oblivious self serve damn near want
easily win court case basically need price low gain marketshare sale judge far Nvidia sale amd point effectively ryzen strategy vs intel cpu market
need well pricing strategy Nvidia shoot foot badly
datum indicate instead
7800xt bloody murder come AMD
AMD will win generation GPU market long Nvidia DLSS CUDA stuff lot people want regardless cost nevermind people buy GPU pc know Nvidia
require exotic cool system pronged reason advantageous manufacturing cost
small chip cheap small chip get well yield chiplet allow AMD use partially faulty chip easily AMD produce cheap throw away chip greedy
TBF sound like packaging go complicated get chiplet die defect not know relative cost thing fair certainly expect charge NV think go slot large pricing gap leave NV get money step toe trigger price war 7900xt 7800xt 6950xt literally announce price cut know rest RDNA2 stack
AMD card rumor sub 550mm 2 add chiplet like 800 mm 2 amazing AMD beat GB card
yeah MCM Chiplets give hope able mass produce point undercut significant degree
hopefully crazy power requirement d upgrade psu
multiple chip design costly silicon wafer yield high
Scott Herkelman CVP GM AMD Radeon ask episode PCWorld Nerd Sapphire make AMD reference gpu answer thank t1beriu find make AMD reference card actually PC Partner Group company sell video card ZOTAC brand
usually reference cooler Coolermaster like cpu heatsink pcb sure AMD dictate bom cost want use few phase input filtering output skip extra like BGA underfill etc
man 6800xt midnight black schweet
sure buy extra allocation Nvidia
Nvidia supposedly double performance core string attach gain yeah AMD need high quality true DLSS competitor come low price win marble 1 5x 2x gen raster performance DLSS quality FSR meh raytrace performance price tag be go cut
maybe got lure nvidia marketing term gaming development move frame generation slowly away frame rasterization case tensor core effective efficient sort task
performance scale linearly tensor core reason lot benefit gpu single purpose product gaming training AI model rendering lot way GPU gaming AMD actually stupidly far Nvidia area hardware software severely lacking fine AMD focus gaming course point post AMD simply stupid greedy hope god AMD nail gpu gaming cheap Nvidia gpu Neural Network development
manage gain mindshare Ryzen cpu way Radeon weird consider FX cpu come dire position like 290X pretty good apart bad stock cool
Tbf pretty huge shortage find 5600x month MSRP scalp sell help start make start discount price increase 5900X 5950X small NVidia case supply issue want artificially hold price
CUDA man kill proper viz rendering solution GPU agnostic
miss op point chicken egg story need undercut win market share mean profit

Ryzen absolutely incredible price performance series pricey definitely deliver good gaming performance
Ryzen case have good product available EPYC Threadripper far strong mainstream user like Reddit play game AMD catch Zen
AMD large company want exploit market good ability like player stupid hope look Ryzen generation ie arguably good product available price aggressively gain mindshare Ryzen generation know competition competitive price tier creep delay release well bang buck sku like 5700x late possible moment difference AMD overtake Intel mind consumer time Zen come thank Zen success afford price new cpu premium Radeon play catch little win marketshare mindhsare RDNA largely overpriced unavailable offer Nvidia term feature set minor gain rasterization performance
annoyingly large people want AMD competitive Nvidia cheap buy Nvidia gpu yes unfortunate GPU likely Nvidia business practice greedy justify long
actually buy 5700xt early well performance euro hardware unbox recommend turn driver issue multi monitor setup people warn happen think harm success entire aggressive pricing effort big talking point time obviously sample size fight driver couple day fan GPU spin anymore test driver return pay like buck super guess story try AMD gpu bad think driver AIB model pretty flawless time 5700xt well impression hope 7700XT deliver 6900xt performance 230w max sell usd MSRP lowered 6900XT list usd EU get vat depend country price GB essentially euro list start euro AIBs easily euro spell think AMD probably undercutting will low sure version dumb value upcoming gen performance buck max sadly look like happen
yeah Nvidia dumb youtuber peddle free review card raytracing actually cripple framerate nvidia card hey raytracing well bro dollar dollar radeon well deal mention adrenaline software click overclock card break sweat

slightly expensive product notably feature actually implement feature well driver sw quality history choice obvious
thing mention valid point Nvidia get AMD game
actually improve RT 7950xt minimum 3x well 6900xt simply virtue have 3x TMUs minimum 6x well 3x tmus 2x clock assume improvement surprised case modest improvement TMU add 6900xt 7950xt
release fuck proprietary shit hell
AMD pretty FSR Resizable BAR actually amazing performance improvement toggle power efficiency overall great performance spend RX GPU achieve near picture quality performance DLSS FSR special tensor core work RTX gpu DLSS work
take Intel extra complacent year Ryzen able catch year turn processor room heater Intel switch happen overnight like fuck Intel fanboy guess Nvidia switch lot tough nut crack fuck way Intel technology good damn greedy
Intel deliver shit product helped shift mind share Nvidia hand 1080ti push great product Nvidia way
yeah Ryzen able beat Intel multi core virtue actually offer core cpu consumer price Ryzen win similar well performance combine significant undercutting
ve rx 5700xt currently 6700xt time ve driver issue Nvidia m laptop gpu

price competitively people will buy will like return pre pandemic pricing claim inflation company expand staffing significantly past year way sustainable demand price stay high
significantly undercut Nvidia people buy Nvidia like previous gen significantly undercut Nvidia Nvidia low price response people thank AMD buy Nvidia happen time time year
actually read news AMD lower MSRP serie gain lot faith news plan bonker msrp lower price
actually raw power impressive people math underwhelming AMD hard time beat raster focus raw power cheape vram well pixelated laggy dlss
oled mainly infinite contrast fast pixel response wide colour gamut
ole useful clamp color space srgb yes switch IPS oled year difference astronomical classify maybe good gaming relate upgrade lcd panel come close black level oled HDR performance blow lcd panel water course oled suffer light bleed past disappoint console game look well pc game despite run low fps low fidelity setting solely run tv monitor monitor technology far tv technology depressing understandable small market
like product trade blow Nvidia have way bad feature set need actually undercut
fast bad overall experience
Faster mean overall experience blow time NVidia release driver slow
buyer vast majority buy Nvidia AMD offer fast product yes yes happen time past likely example
need investor clap quarter sense Nvidia
clearly understand market shareholding market share guarantee profit maximizer AMD go focus
earning
fiscal year try quarter earning call quarterly performance super short sighted soon away soon decision actually beneficial month
Nvidia want bleed customer dry signal future plan need cash project greatly slow future generation demand similar phone good people feel compulsion upgrade smartphone come

AMD release card performance price NV possibly expect people buy AMD price perf choice NV low perf NV competitive price choice likely NV perf low price obvious choice AMD NV correct true way hell gtx1050 ti gtx gtx fucking Super dominate steam hardware hwsurvey videocard world work like dreamland
6900xts go price mining boom people buy 3060 instead end AMD GPU lmao
3090 buy mining AMD card bad mining compare Nvidia people buy GPU gaming tiny tiny marketshare steam compare crush 3060
s mainly good mining not people swap 6700xt cash direct 1 1 5700xts not bus width slash
average consumer say dumb
beast card veeery tempt grab soon price drop thing shit psu need upgrade lol option wait efficient 7600xt know long
okay buy AMD card buy
exception ve people know real life computer build pass offer cost upgrade XT instead demand pay silly people respect build machine matter mock em get P
DLSS revolutionary definitely sway RTX surprised DLSS3 close revolutionary AMD knock park RDNA3 probably go switch principle Nvidia honestly approach late release
better driver Idk not notice difference switch Ti 6900xt work reality mess driver badly nowadays AMD AMD year ago Better RT performance yes widely adopt technology especially console not deal buy argument moment year yes current RT capable card slow bother DLSS run situation 6900xt need yeah AMD bit progress expect like DLSS RDNA3 give FSR2 bad
driver well agree rest actually need geforce experience account late Nvidia driver Linux driver terrible AMD one well
RT worth anyways
reason go 6900xt
green soothing color red tbh
better Windows driver maybe subjective better Linux Steam deck driver absolutely imagine press Start button lag desktop animation DLSS guess buy RTX thinking DLSS good game DLSS year release game think support DLSS month well DLSS adoption rate likely title
Stability yes AMD massive stride Nvidia UI look like Win stability problem 6800xt isolate bad pc memory VRam later bad hdmi cable debatable agreed Nvidia generation ahead think surprise AMD generation clear win Nvidia
price history buck MSRP stop apologetic Nvidia
think mean people willing spend scalped Nvidia card scalp AMD one
know dlss know believe good turn great
video card
pandemic
mean like people buy 5700xts mining era
buy usual will able fact ip
AMD fault
money printer People trade 5700xt owner 6700xts cash well mining card
know you see stock series country Australia AMD clearly prioritize Ryzen part 7n space make sense popular line product sell serie Nvidia lot series balance fab space multiple product line
feel obligated come international remark representative Steam rest world economy people tier luxury item
remember internationally GPU price usually USA price country tax import tax honestly suck dollar value
course guy say iTclown face live salary high price low gaming priority majority people

yeah argument let bad launch stick give massive fuck time sell miner
cheap alternative run ac room 60f
true perform close price
yeah sure tech call Smart Access Memory mistaken think go AMD Intel chip little well productivity Intel compatible board available white plan build push decision Intel cpu upgrade home pc go AMD review new cpu good
sense cost pc feed family poor member month undeveloped world pc valuable
talk lack access dlss old gpu comparison update fsr amd free
relatively love tweak setting Game
yeah ofc ofc not read upcoming DLSS boost 4x speed current DLSS game DLSS massive boost AMD need improve FSR massively compete hope
get new sufficient actually true whwb goalpost move demand title popup
hold expectation rdna3 announcement expect AMD overshadow Nvidia performance
gain market share fan loyal customer etc forward think long term growth expense premium penny window opportunity literally equal juggernaut space misstep say juggernaut ala Intel charge cpu initially look stock price cpu market share
exactly executive think market bear bear call bs idea company regulate make sense long term survival industry Nvidia money consumer GPU space anymore God sake charge class GPU great AMD right thing go count
justification keep price dramatically low steal huge amount market share NVIDIA GPU sector way server cpu meet production answer increase demand low price benefit price aggressively excited math
AMD price high like Nvidia upgrade time game
release Ryzen great affordable price market share minor price increase good price compare alternative think op right lot gamer TM will want try AMD card know trusty Nvidia card price people fence great help
people buy NVIDIA like similar price people
chance people bite Nvidia high price AMD price look dumb greedy loose opportunity gain marketshare customer blindly follow Nvidia stupid will AMD market leader make look like follower dumb
will sell price match Nvidia work gen mining boom ensure gpu price sell instantly miner sell actually compete sell product AMD outperform Nvidia wide margin price card significantly low Nvidia go hard time clearing inventory Nvidia brand advantage edge term feature well RT performance DLSS price similar rasterization performance consumer Nvidia simply money
price Zen higher offer low mid
Buy PS pc gaming verge dead
computer long buy low tier product build price acceptable need relative use upgrade current build major overkill instead new build pass stuff 5800x3d cpu get ITX board like want skip gpu altogether buy instead get xt pricing bad spend justify cost spend care afford pricing suck bare minimum serie mess find new video card price new product difference spend 3k system upgrade decide ING get spend small upgrade
video card straight die option upgrade hell lot excellent indie old game Steam heck dozen Library get play pay AMD decide try pay 7800XT good scheme nope deal like nice new video card need sure want badly Crypto pandemic recession come think Nvidia readjust price pretty quickly AMD ahead win marketshare
supply vs demand demand want price stop happen sell demand exceed choose go cheap far well option increase market share 7700XT match 40 80 people flock embarrass main competition time AMD Intel Nvidia
AMD keep price insane covid price massive Nvidia customer sure go fanboy small common sense pay especially huge power draw series
like good way market share
imo show dumb people watch real time competetor lose customer faith good point major partner financially worth stick straight test drive idea leave wide open market share shift maybe stupid lowly pleb dear God pile drive competition ground give open opportunity especially product competitive par competitor
upgrade gen kinda lackluster far need high end gpu like seriousness need double power tout new actual professional new card pretty beastly flex imo greedy doubt people purchase
prepared buy arc deal shit driver
AMD price high go to mean combative literally think exec ceo think depend try maximize profit later basically go short term price high go long term keep price low adoption help developer optimization brand trust possibly customer loyal long run mean potential well profit future mind Intel lurk right AMD threat seriously
reminder Intel gpu release AMD want market share look NVidia Intel
AMD price high buy RTX series
Nvidia produce gpu want try reduce order production capacity wafer AMD appear competitive price performance saturate mark leave Nvidia pant
AMD price high go to mean combative literally think exec ceo think Zen Thread ripper essentially save company fantastic performance vs price cpu market
match price parity close Nvidia series think sede ground Nvidia Ampere stock win cheap serie board minimum imo
work investor overpricing want money feel justify
people buy card stay away pc gaming love AMD atleast half market desktop gpu
buy xd
amd lower price Nvidia people buy Nvidia amd chance build fund scientific computing strong expect slight undercut
price crazy buy stay current card year
AMD come Market Share able gain ground Intel low Ryzen pricing strategy gen think rocket science exact thing gpu
AMD currently card price point Nvidia introduce navi31 increase raster sense away GB price sell cut chip easily beat GB
AMd price high actually compete end Nvidia push RT performance ADA AMD find difficult catch seriously focus RT improvement
thing AMD massively discount current stock Nvidia fight price high AMD cut price despite have massive oversupply Nvidia hold price steady despite have massive oversupply AMD aware sale current card go affect pipeline Nvidia launch TI perform card little Nvidia sell AMD TI equivalent XT price AMD cut price hard Nvidia mean AMD likely go push XT XT lot fast Nvidia threaten pricing card launch stack considerably higher

fair try performance crown people buy Nividia need software respect well Nvidia stand geforce experience force sign load control stick Nvidia Control Panel year ago AMD make good stride push Nvidia round card hopefully push time think try undercut Nvidia sake need profit reinvest rebuild think strategy multi chip help profitability like Ryzen
tell EVGA
think AMD charge sure rdna3 price high RDNA2 know change performance watt AMD chance rdna3 competitive advanced feature like RT Super Sampling raw performance good
let discount massive deal EVGA dipping make Nvidia card bind splash
EVGA peace AIB partnership give AMD huge chance pounce

super user DLSS vary lot quality setting game worth gain FPS vs have 2k prefer high fps visual come enjoy DLSS
yeah guess adoption obviously pretty bad right new lot game mean
ride dick upscalle simple fact upscalling look noticeably bad native literally huge backwards step Nvidia want add RT core generation minimum like RT truly viable decide improve lighting reduce image iq compensate way industry work try fight pr pr iq crap will run FSR look bad imagine artifact level blur fuck single review DLSS time try friend computer largely
yup reinstall Tarkov wonder blurry recall problem AMD FSR get basically fps turn vs FSR Quality preset image clear 6800xt 3440x1440p average 100ish FPS FSR look like big improvement
turing perform Pascal maybe price performance certain tier

half fan 5800x 6800xt agree hear old archive file hdd sound make SSD quiet comparison previous system
bit louder uber review amd r9 290x 26 html review say overall disappoint acoustic experience R9 290X provide AMD invest time develop good cooler like NVIDIA GTX Titan
AMD real answer series huh 390x Fury Fury X count AMD totally absent series
nVidia hot power equal thing Artic IV Extreme sub 60c quiet OC
lot power reach Titan level speed Titan 290X similar amount power 290X bad cooler perf watt similar
keep printout RX480 preorder desk past couple year reminder price someday come pay Red Devil GB come Civ Doom run game fine bump title wait 6800xt feel like way fucking cash old card hope wait November instead
absolutely series refreshe good refreshe AMD good generation recent memory IMHO
honestly Fury Nano 3xx series class remind Radeon VII yes launch similar time market lineup treat series argument efficiency stand case speed advantage big offset imho case GTX vs 380x 380 advantage AMD large fact outsell MASSIVELY proof AMD noticeably well sell 390x inefficient lend undervolte FRTC mad appearance care efficiency lot well overall win Grenada Pro XT

reasoning long make Nvidia card card reserve rma warranty inclined believe risk 6800xt cheap want benchmark video see 6800xt pull ahead slightly 1440p ray trace DLSS FSR
stupid feature people chase fps counter like dlss fsr hack need gpu run decent native People use want game properly sense Dlss downgrade quality speed well manage speed benefit away
late driver
update new release think
late strip extra bs remove stuff like Experience Ansel telemetry etc package People think need program download late driver severely misinformed
yes certainly late driver
yes current late driver match current GeForce experience proof need downvote prove wrong
window driver extremely outdated Microsoft go certify new driver month outdate Nvidia amd Intel pretty Nvidias website new driver day choose install geforce experience
lose window install recently window roll driver 6900xt cause os die problem solve issue temp sensor stop report driver version fix update Nvidia driver mixed bad bsod go r9 fury nitro work perfectly 1080ti driver issue long period work company driver issue idea perfect fanboy talk
uninstalle reinstall window multiple time stop window update try lot solution work amernime modde driver
yeah Windows issue late driver old version apparently Windows check update old driver
uninstalle Windows multiple time change literally single setting find try different driver update crash little bit crash Amernime modde driver eliminate crash completely fault shape form vow buy single AMD product experience
totally unreasonable use Linux computer serve purpose general usage sure Linux way Gaming Linux far bad support good art linux practically unsupported like mind spend bit extra nvidia thing work troubleshoot computer stuff frankly include AMD gpu recommend friend family go stick Windows program actually work use Linux way want computer
AMD lot work Zen work properly x370 disable platform lock place

ahh
people use driver menu lol
Steam Deck guess
rx6600 like rtx3060 well price GPU outgoing generation AMD Nvidia come high end GPU foreseeable future good GPU

bus width like memory chip bit number memory chip x bus width yeah bus width people think mean
iirc thing AMD consistently fall short memory bus bandwith try massive cache increase Bus series historically s hold card
small bus mean cheap manufacture hurt mean bandwidth yeah matter
card actually perform IRL relative cost thing matter lol
tbh class getting move bit bus 70 build die give bus good way simplify production standard class downgrade sell class card class scummy fuck People buy GB model getting rip
sure sale tactic use imo Surface pricing get hand SP6 especially give try simplify lineup dropping fun type Cover color end get sister SP6 bundle like mention Christmas year ago bundle accessory tablet MSRP easy sell
know try fucking moron
oh guess mean misread slide say big letter GB suppose Jen Hsun get product wrong write correct look like spread absolute bullshit call blind read exactly fuck announce shit CUDA core display board Nvidia fucking
launch like week launch month launch different probably keep go similar story edit actually look think announce time launch date offset talk series mention
card launch call 12gig
time global pandemic disruption supply demand logistic entire generation gpu semiconductor industry entirety year time
think dumb fuck buy price long think new toy get to pad incoming revenue inflated price crypto collapse lie investor
delay look super bad investor AMD go steam ahead delay guess L actually drop price non meme tier card price set supply demand cost go competition profit way sorry time cut price maybe Nvidia cater crypto bro mess
presumption sell loss unreasonable especially zen zen technique lead mature price significantly low RnD chiplet amortize distribute successful zen2 launch fair assumption power unit cost high amd sell low relatively basic analysis form reasonable educate consider hypothesis know datum say sure valid point epyc zen zen era sure epyc world beater look market share datum time

gamer want honestly twitch shooter run hundred frame non issue cinematic game have well animation smoothness honestly great logical step fact MSFS improve frame rate awesome pure stupidity
November
dude approach limit EUV fabbe decent yield get tough tough think lead edge fabless chip maker like nvidia AMD absolutely need TSMC gen Intel Samsung small node think chiplet 3d stacking think China spend decade dump billion dollar company like SMIC steal IP TSMC western company good manage janky nm DUV yield approach limit inexpensive mass produce leading edge chip fabrication go expensive shrink die Jensen go mass produce consumer graphic card cost fab chip know million gamer will pay card miner sure gamer way fucking hell
hope AMD answer DLSS get RT performance soon tho ti year later get expensive
rude NVIDIA monopoly real instead call shithead bet use GPU gaming point view make sense FSR vs DLSS debatable well point FSR feature NVIDIA provide feature people prefer NVIDIA AMD RTX today inflate end Ray Tracing gamer consider gimmick true gamer 3d relate workspace student designer basically tackle 3d application fun future customer use use gpus purpose gaming option choose NVIDIA card today AMD catch NVIDIA regard matter competent RX7000 raw spec lot people prefer NVIDIA AMD alternative
Yep Fermi hot mess easily forget AMD class hot power hungry unfortunately think AMD cheap well people go wait Nvidia cheap buy single purpose seemingly try stop Nvidia gouging reward sell decide bother type competition 290x significantly fast significantly cheap people remember fact stock cooler bad ignore AIB partner have excellent model run hot design people comprehend GPU core 90c ok
mean thing change

Huh 390x Fury Fury X count look expensive 390x rebrande 290X originally mean fight Kepler Titan bit memory bus large die size slow high power consumption double 200w extra fury Fury X similar die size Ti slow 40w high power consumption HBM completely blow manufacturing cost water vs Ti AMD like like answer series blow power consumption water build cost water fundamental architecture significantly inferior
power use heat deal good heatsink mitigate heat right regard like slap huge aio current Intel chip call run cool
yeah Nvidias gain market share lol point steam user hardware survey instal
sentiment get old look vendor friend want suck compensation good relationship customer company sell addition product
sell compete product offer AMD come compelling product offering absolutely capture market share like Intel victim mentality AMD fan silly AMD come competitive lineup gen capture market share question able design compelling product want price competitively thing allow Zen win new customer falter Intel chance Nvidia fail reason like Nvidia fan hate AMD overprice product outperform Nvidia simply match Nvidia performance price win new customer
international pricing well nvidia card

Yep Fermi hot mess easily forget AMD class hot power hungry think AMD generation meme power consumption performance Vega recent people memory Fermi yeah Ampere power hungry RDNA2 pretty comparable performance thermi meme GTX fast Vega roughly comparable time launch performance got beat 1080ti pascal generation NVIDIA pricing go insane hurt AMD Vega expensive produce Hawaii good hell long got follow Fiji Vega unfortunate AMD Maxwell Pascal competitor
got downvote suggest switch Nvidia AMD try Intel future seriously declare hobby dead
AMD remember exactly happen Intel gpu AMD come fighting Intel stagnation right expect bankrupt couple year take generation look cpu market share high high
yeah perception time

good info upgrade Monday Asus x670e cpu 7700x reset default stock disable EXPO II PBO curve core go way fiasco resolve say run L Connect sure know recently finally release version support minimize startup
late bio limit soc voltage
think end warranty fix soon
interesting ASUS X470 Strix know use high voltage BIOS 3700x maybe ASUS use agressive voltage X3D chip Hmmm
loke picture faliure cpu diffrent place x3d chip let let substraight chiplet io die ihs update bio prio use 7700x temprature let
guy thing happen 7950x3d post picture cpu socket later thread sadly picture bit weirdly angled hard good strange failure exact nature spot
sure increase risk happen plus idle low usage
like literally say car overheat go km trip stop minute pretty dumb logic bro
understand kind temperature happen like close degree need melt plausible theory botch delid lol
finally jump AMD time impression AMD tend weird issue intel option stupid far power draw etc price performance brainer see weird AMD problem post nervous
tbh B650E Steel Legend ya need
yes high end Asus nightmare budget Gigabyte board
recently add find right hand call user flair provide ss set good luck
yes motherboard definitely unrecoverable
yes cause item damage sure damage place mobo voltage supply cpu issue rmaable
not actually know cpu root cause mobo PSU know
motherboard dead result clearly user error yes cover RMA
guy backwards motherboard kill cpu way yeah motherboard need RMA need new cpu
necessarily cpu problem bulging point heating issue cause poor contact power rail motherboard socket easily cause
otr motherboard kill cpu sure cpu fault
motherboard issue cpu cause cpu cause easily motherboard short electrical overstress
conclusion premature inverse
cpu be motherboard yes connect
AMD chip inside fault guardrail happen
yes cpu manufacturer warranty break take need provide replacement good example brand new psu reputable manufacturer explode take system matter component thing matter apparent cause problem problem case component actually cause problem manufacturer need file claim maybe case damage cause blast power motherboard originate psu error
know cpu fault contact moba cause issue nvidia plug fry issue cause inproper contact plug
leave possibility faulty cpu socket cause issue tbh
rma return MOBO cause issue return CPU cause issue manufacturer likely accept
know cause weirdness past Intel board different board play fast loose timing voltage cause cpu essentially OC d box user realize similar happen try AMD likely cpu pretty sure warranty cover replace damage way PSU kill system company PSU need payout thr test
AMD Motherboard manufacturer go incredibly interested exactly know fact moment cpu cause yes cpu bulge motherboard
likely Motherboard cpu Motherboard control regulation power cpu vast majority time cpu fail happen motherboard motherboard go good cpu work consistently medical issue technician decade fix recover pc late build computer component electronic GPU RAM etc see cpu motherboard manufacturing defect excess solder overheat throttle shutdown protection excess solder leak board short capacitor MOSFET go BANG board fix pin
know cpu cause motherboard send wrong voltage
know cpu cause AMD Ryzen cpu different parameter prevent issue PPT TDC EDC limit look like motherboard ignore voltage current limitation cause cpu burn
chance motherboard fault pins touch
mean 7800x3d go cause damage s scary
think bio rolling on the floor laughe
Am5 issue know example faulty cpus rare
cpu chance die
5800x3d maybe kill x570 board move kid pc get 13700kf go boot nothin try 5800x3d board 5900x work fine board dead fuck wonder new board cpu month old edit fair know kill grain salt board cpu dead cpu post board thing certainly melt socket certainly odd occurrence
unlucky previous setup late defective 6700k RMA d right away skylake generation incredibly reliable performant time
cpu need RMA i5 6600k buy day random freeze issue till day think cpu work
series issue brother 5900x dead arrival bsod time remember que people issue online buy RMA replacement good far build computer workplace enthusiast year time see problem cpu
new tech 3d series d obvious wait
old house power outage pc turn power restoration surge protector question guy
cpu blow error code screen
ye start
AI Suite Extreme
wrong 7950x3d buy work perfectly usecase use cpu gaming
doubt OP good look cpu socket happen consider happen spot user board probably engineering manufacturing defect jumpstart failure cpu know couple case
convinced poor contact pin pad manufacturing issue cause heat build lead bulge delamination cause pin edge pad see numerous intel cpu fail poor pin pad contact cause pad disintegrate occasionally recover solder internal damage
yea thought see short
fair run idea run away Windows decide run anti malware update idle load cpu bit
ok good
yes read faulty AMD nowadays say hear roblem
bulge notice installation slight difference color contact cpu wipe iso remain cause manufacturing process guess benign red herring
yeah mean
1 45v perfectly normal stock operation wake core actually will not persist not try manually overclock set fix voltage Zen2 require harmful voltage approach stock performance able spike voltage briefly screw boost wake core check say exceed 1 35v degradation reason zen1 pure misinformation max safe load voltage 1 15v 1 2V depend ask exact cpu cpu adhere value motherboard Asus cpu kill crap stock apply overvolt edit right thread
confuse manual voltage auto voltage zen cpu entire subsystem control voltage current microsecond scale totally normal auto voltage hit 1 5v Zen take account temp load time manual voltage like firehouse throw max current possible specify voltage protection disable safe use low manual voltage PBO totally safe protection enable auto adjust voltage safe level general manual voltage clock Ryzen safe typically result low performance

MSI motherboard kill Samsung M 2 NVMe drive cool pad preattache motherboard shield pad poor quality start drip liquid wet m 2 chip system heat MSI not shit say likely silicon liquid not cause short circuit blame samsung hint fact not healthy small plastic part metal contact include sticker wet dry daily basis MSI not shit say need proof defintely go to proof wallet easily decide manufacturer build
RMA work burden proof manufacturer prove prove fault fault accept RMA case cpu fault mobo manufacturer seek compensation AMD vice versa point

gun not kill people bullet
correct answer product capable physically damage product hardware defect go want know care instance happen work technical support tech company happen usually send customer new request customer send damage hardware
explain motherboard vendor money destroy board defect
yeah mean mobo kill cpu
yes definitely investigate talk company definitely will case minimum wage warehouse employee give away refuse RMA
limited experience hardware company definitely talk failure reason lot time blame talk
Mobo manufacturer blame cpu user installation AMD blame mobo manufacturer user installation refund replace
basically lawyer thing sue mother let figure fuck edit actually say sue sue let figure like make RMA claim let figure fault
Threadstarter AMD Mainboard manufacture RMA number connection

guess gigabyte not come malaysia
yeah BIOS update late non beta memory overclock EXPO clean install info ASUS AMD GamersNexus issue
meaningful thing thing odd hit lightning sudden hear time despite rare freak accident situation
yeah unfortunately Asus board available country hope get good board wait cpu arrive bother return window day haha sure
see LTT video awesome 7800x3d chip plan build year pull trigger research good motherboard use randomly come gamersnexus video melt cpu get extremely lucky build AMD pc honestly consider take price hit intel failure catastrophic lifetime

possible motherboard cause motherboard supply power cpu way user overclocke manually fiddle voltage absolutely failure cause incorrect power delivery control BIOS thing like happen system load idle sort power delivery issue

yes run large department
say sue make RMA let figure like lawyer sue let figure fault
maybe motherboard burn mark pin like RMA AMD 7700X RMA team understaffed B overwhelmed c B day respond inquiry simply ignore inquiry lose blame USPS deliver package miraculously find start ask question experience ASUS AMD year count replace
ASUS advance RMA product RMA handle January past require motherboard send inspection
use yea difference gen3 gen4 gpu like m year builder maybe gpu upgrade way make sense future proof
buy B650e hope fine Atleast m buy board
concern quality control cause glaring sit month change news

Jesus
b450 Tomahawks good good budget decent mobo recommendation Glad hold
r3 massive improvement
go surprised jump performance feel snappy
right prick get bit cheeky think away
AMD get cozy axe AM4 GPU pricing model basically NVIDIA scalper level pricing undercut tiny bit
historical context AMD initially consider limit Zen X570 user vast majority Zen cpu Zen Zen B550 user time B550 launch surprising announcement AMD week say discontinue support old chipset upcoming Ryzen series codename Zen press deck receive recent Ryzen 3300x review AMD include slide indicate B350 X370 B450 X470 chipset support future Ryzen processor clarify support future cpu generation upcoming Ryzen series limit motherboard don series chipset current x570 board upcoming B550 motherboard
have new socket year short term plan obsolescence clearly good manufacturer partner consumer AMD AM4 obviously make great feature user platform AMD advantage wonder Intel
confused AMD promise support AM4 term physical socket form factor promise support specific chipset broken logic think remotely come conclusion AMD meet kind promise longevity AM4
recommend check rew time function call bio prevent fan try temp spike
aio temp load load
perf price 5700x well Germany 5700x cost 5800x3d make x3d expensive know 5700x gets overlook good budget upgrade option AM4 IMO
switch awesome performance uplift certain game example tarkov brutal small complain toasty forgive
good price performance available actually think bad cost close 2x 5700X price region cost 7700X K objectively well cpu thing 5800x3d favor cheap widely available motherboard doubt AMD use fact charge premium 5800x3d great cpu somewhat overhyped like cost lot
jump believe smooth game term low
kid go 2600x difference computer boot fast bio quick try like time finally able
R9 3900x m cpu bind
actually lot technical issue need work severely cut biose zen3 work mb bio board tbh baffle shit reverse decision launch give support cpu year original end date like amusing people sub transform company friend company equally bad end day AMD deliver original promise Intel kill support socket tbh make sense AMD want limit upgradability margin cpu way high margin chipset
absolutely mind probably update BIOS new version old cpu update Bios install new cpu board will work
go 2600x big difference
Mhh idk I d invest AM5 motherboard come good price high end B650 performance jump AM4 won t big anymore 5800x3d
yeah challenge sure think actually technical limitation logistical limitation people write biose AIB prioritize new board imo motherboard maker fault x370 a320 board receive support decently fast
watch friend replace motherboard i3 k i5 9400f i7 6700k 7700 K go eBay sell 7700k z270 money new board 9600k 9700 k Ryzen 3700x 3900x expensive Z270 board i3 decide want upgrade expensive i9 i7 stick DDR4 non z series board replace motherboard replace cpu new go Ryzen b450 m Pro4 board

way upgrade bio time
wait upgrade Zen series motherboard yes run 5600x x370 board Asus release BIOS board download old cpu update BIOS replace cpu get new cpu verify support board BIOS combination
hate AM5 People hate overprice motherboard
buy b450 board perfectly fine need fraction O aware AM5 board cost low end AM5 board PCIe
afford AM5
yes super happy ddr4 ram obsolete unlike intel pay 9x ddr5 replacement addition kick

similar upgrade path 3800x
depend exactly play
go 5800x3d blow mind maybe 5700x ok early era power delivery motherboard price like performance 1440p example x200B definitely worth spend difference well GPU
AM4 socket
youself tap shoulder right decision
come price 388 possibly justify exact situation lmao get 5700x usd get 5800x3d price performance 1440p consider performance like money absolute good scenario 1440p take earth make realize well spend buck well GPU 5800x3d
spend money yes worth x200B like friend say money whiskey afford ice
Asus strix b350f bio update work
AMD cpu fail guess aware TSMC make ryzen chip advanced fab world make chip apple nvidia INTEL Intel rely TSMC advanced chip nm pretty stupid comment sure delete
consider price difference high justify

Shh place reason fact
yeah decision hard 1440p ultrawide r7 5800x3d rolling on the floor laughe
not decide xd
Am5 board incredibly expensive country decent x670 r7 5800x3d know decent b650 totally capable price x670 r7 5800x3d look pretty good reason think upgrade 1440p 240hz ole monitor 165hz shitty fhd va
wrong AMD actively stop AIBs support new cpu get reverse motherboard maker fault AMD stop motherboard maker support new cpu ref
exactly option 5800x3d high prolong life system year board
have option upgrade cpu year nice bonus let buy cpu amd 1800x year later buy line cpu 5950x 5800x3d setup easy year way year buy cpu have notch performance will prob crappy year old cpu end matter
upgrade long new part come like buy Zen 5800x3d compress pricing lot Intel mainstream high end CPU stay expensive market good near good board handle example cheap Buy work 9900k go nearly dollar eBay AMD new mean mean 3700x like eBay core tiny bit slow gaming theory Zen pricing high AMD keep Zen production long upgrade probably go to way Zen Zen Zen
happy reckon get away haha
Idk s people say
remember Zen ton pr stuff angry folk angry Zen work series board work Zen unofficial support
motherboard list official support specsheet tell work official support show asu PRIME B350 Plus officially support Zen investigation suggest AMD cut official support
dumb afford Porsche car hate

great thank information
glad big performance jump 2700x
yeah speak 1080p 1440p well choice
realize 5 10fps
save tough assume people nice rich save money nice happy happiness buy nice exclusive have ton disposable income
upgrade 5700x B350F let celebrate decision AMD instead Intel
ok consider future upgrade
good assume guarantee cache bottleneck degree series DDR5 mix find review interesting finally land
jump believe smooth game term low
want upgrade AM5 platform soon 5800x3d stay AM4 heckyea 5800x3d good AM4 chip term gaming performance year come core game use yea money gpu
quiet pure Loop FX mm Temps high degree nzxt h7 flow case
feel like main diff active ccd instead
depend motherboard manufacture normally flash new stable version board fine board need update x200B mainboard update series mainly low end b350 board x370 board look support site mainboard befor consider upgrading
B550 come x570 tho precise
actually x570 come zen launch
x570 board come bio close x570 extreme4 x570 come way early Ryzen
week
mind explain process 5800x3d get hot gaming 85c 92c underclocking sound great able find GitHub thread PBO2 follow
way well gaming performance contrary comment say

gigabyte find support processor list
power delivery hold ASRock board want 5700x find korean video YouTube read graph performance tank continuous benchmark run 5800x3d buy power delivery switch DDR5 new build
thing a320 capacitor make good gaming actually see couple YouTube video direct comparison explanation good
bit disappointed little difference got go gtx970 rx6600xt realise play cpu intensive game
Joseph
way well main practical difference support 3466mhz DDR4 low onboard BIOS chip capacity time people question longevity low capacity BIOS chip big support future cpu end expense make BIOS look like old school text one instead people actually prefer 3466mhz limit ideal term maximise Infinity Fabric get 3600mhz ram oce impact serie less degree series people budget buy ecosystem probably get cl16 kit
reason skeptical AM5 worth high price cpu longevity completely mercy AMD decision axe late cpu support chipset
recommend check Fan Control github yes setup hysteresis fan response time open program fan will ramp temp increase maybe like degee increase similar delay second respond fast Cinebench run

oh trust literally keyboard receive power quick window boot
BF2042 Hogwarts Legacy play right Hogwarts cpu
time good time
5600x 5700x save 5800x3d cost add monitor budget performance difference big cpu ofc bit consider game play
yeah probably will need upgrade year it s time AM5 mobo cheap decide heavily lean AM5 AM4 EoL
forgot time amd want ax support zen3 old board intel get competitive amd magically give zen3 support non series mobo
higher resolution chance cpu bottleneck gpu power high resolution like 4k cpu fine
official look mobo page manufacturer website add support
official support AMD flat lie series board able support Zen go far force board maker beta bioses add support AMD spend year give varying reason work majority prove false suddenly say work AMD give green light ok board maker release BIOS update
asu Prime X370 Pro 5600x list supported cpu board website look support cpu list board asu Prime B350 Plus list lot 5xxx cpu support BIOS list include 5800x3d url hope load
generation car Porsche price basic Citroen people right complain
hate porshe want cool seater ton option include nice looking cheap mx 8 ton want modern AMD system AM5 mobo overpriced
yes know fact main difference low drastically increase will not fps drop GPU difference 1440p like fps low price maybe future think get 5800x3d price sell 5700x cheap 5800x3d cheap right ok invest upgrade RTX 4070TI 1440p gaming
nice rich rich spend dollar scalped need urgently shortage eternal bad mistake term monetary management spend margin possibility let win 100k lottery like broke expense thing charge decide use money 50k dollar car have income maintain people consider spend money high ultra end probably mean maintain hardware urgent need cover dumb pay dollar GPU pay loan barely end month food

month rolling on the floor laughe
agree Intel e core p core architecture look pretty interesting
thank s think people literally bully worry
check support Zen explanation AMD block official support series motherboard work flash series bio case OP unofficial BIOS miss
actually lot technical issue assume initially remove beta bio try avoid confusion board definitely shit imagine buy board get beta bio able use zen1 cpu launch alongside B350 board crap issue need work year AIB work overcome problem think cut support business reason AMD make CPU chipset hell x570 chipset basically Zen2 o die want force people upgrade mean sell way cpu board maker work beta biose obviously want release think greed factor initially happen B350
reason AM5 platform expensive literally article explain certain component AM5 motherboard complex manufacture volume correspond AM4 part compare year old mature platform month old say people year post sub praise Ryzen 10900X AM5 motherboard
go 5700x like stable low hope help VR gaming sure worth 3700x instead x3D
destitute ton disposable income
honestly decent uplift performance AMD bring market degree gain question state dynamic change assume
gaming gpu sub optimally access ram cpu ideally game use vram single fast step add extra slow step 3d cache turn additional slow step
yeah 5800x will idle 45c lol hate necessarily bad get 70C game PBO setting
different chipset actually read x570s variant
comment parent post say wrong forget x570s different thing passive cooling right
ah right definitely mean undervolting thank correction explanation appreciate
buy 5800x3d
feel pain gig vram
obama
taste salt go old thread AMD require new chipset socket Zen TR get Zen tr right Zen launch
ask Ryzen people ReBAR know vendor enable need try surely Asrock say f u AMD enable stuff like lol care Pcie Gen lol want rebar
nice board get decide will run Zen Intel s bed hold cpu performance crown buy new board Zen
literally pair brand new ryzen 5700x Super pc house day
thx
new bio update Asus ROG B550 use curve optimizer undervolt
yeah try uefi option reason get lucky try reboot
It s interesting doesn t warrant purchase AM5 Intel EoL soon it s cheap AMD right
AMD block official support board support mobo maker
AMD originally promise easy flip switch cautious fanbase overreact usual
forget AMD originally go allow series board support Zen processor lot pushback consumer AMD recant actually lot technical issue technical issue keep push prove false definitely shit imagine buy board get beta bio able use zen1 cpu launch alongside mean like buy retail board retail bios able support cpu need use AMD official program loan low end processor update BIOS support new cpu problem able support cpu old BIOS problem motherboard decade random board provide update business reason AMD make CPU chipset hell x570 chipset basically Zen2 o die want force people upgrade mean sell way CPU AMD wafer commitment Global Foundries AMD need pump number happen user upgrade series chipset prove ASMedia force user upgrade x570 fabbe GloFo give AMD large headroom meet wafer commitment
think entry level B650 PCIe overpriced imo main reason board price way AMD raise TDP originally AM4 Ryzen 90w PPT Ryzen 90w 140w PPT ryzen well bin Ryzen power consumption pretty fair high end X570 expensive build handle CPU pull power zen4 launch board need able support 7600X 7600X PPT 5800x significantly 5700x buy instead AMD board consistently cheap Intel one downgrade vrm vrm cooling issue hope Zen4 initially go far power performance curve back a620 B650 board release cheap handle 90w R5
sure fantastic uplift ddr5 6000mhz fast compare 8000mhz ddr5cand low latency intel
true plenty example cpu manufacturer continue implement certain thing fully optimize gamble future technology active market technology say hope pull gamble crucial run memory people talk

buy
yeah need feature plan VR AMD brainer
DLSS FSR necessary 4k power usage difference 95w term high end gaming system aesthetic subjective need PSU cable adapter new psu upgrade new system anyways AMD win admit compete want power choice
jinx review AMD go backwards slide make vague chart terrible comparison FSR instead raw performance reward shitty like Nvidia wait independent review
like R9 Nano powerful dwarf
probably copper finstack effect radiator paint black

pick AMD AIB Powercolor XFX sapphire
unlike EVGA not recent reputation explode exact year mark reasonable comparison
AMD card like Sapphire AMD EVGA Nvidia dedicated high quality AIB Sapphire heartbeat look great imo far understand sapphire AMD like tier OEM reference model line Sapphire XFX forget A1 choice
EVGA quality shit gr8 customer service warranty own Evga card fail point own gigabyte Asus fail believe sapphire well quality AIBs
pcb VRM standpoint little well reference speak customer service TOXIC Extreme LC card cool obviously XFX Asrock ASUS likely par well build quality general stage
like Reference personally
POWERCOLOR 3
add board iirc essentially right AIB produce non founders edition GPU custom cooler board
long time GPU market idea AIB stand far tell mean company card gpu like EVGA AIB think B end Bone know term come year think long forget think like non reference design lol

easy
dumb amazing time nice work not wait result
AMD deserve optic like pretty skeptical get root problem
u think melt tube fitting u good seal
number step take sequence tubing hot water leave system mean sound pessimistic look like sequence loop like cycle hot water tubing past vrm know output vrm component math educate guess vrm sequence will cool look cool
need cool gray thing gpu thermal pad touch heat sink

like slot card
zip tie fitting like compression fitting come people completely forgot water cooling
wow
not die loop essentially cool hot water
um save like hr bs buy cover waterblock lol probably well temp
temp load superposition k

head day
think op multiple pump
agreed good think gpu extremely sensitive temp change m make sure get overkill cooling
agreed not extend mini go overboard m try soak pcb heat vrm gpu temperature sensitive
water ridiculously high specific heat capacity flow rate matter heat transfer happen thermal gradient point unlikely reach need dump 4x 11x joule energy define mass water increase c temperature compare mass metal silicon
free flow manifold not need flow loop go
say custom loop hardware fast available spend hundred dollar buy well hardware instead cool bad hardware
Haha true time killer fsr game play not dlss option fsr natively support game

beautiful right
real 6900xt aswell wait week build oc result
agreed loop favor try loop line length block count loop connect test go interesting loop gets favor past gpu like manifold cross flow heavily favor time pure dependent flow self think go parallel main
Gpu get volt modde get pass
I v multiple gpu like pass fly color issue beat cover waterblock temp
thank update

oh assume enthusiast end game process
doesn t open loop think Buildzoid test closed loop cool remember correctly yea need good cooler advantage
sound like good feature consumer cpu box genuine question consumer CPU expensive time consume degree like lot
think liquid metal direct silicon stuff abrasive not find right word
make sense lap direct die desktop apply pressure die gpu
cpu come IHS average user probably break chip install poor thermal result time early 2000s AMD Athlon cpu come IHS crack chip die tech forum regularity People overtightene heat sink mount simply instal wrong easily destroy cpu way add bonus lack IHS mean limited absent thermal management feature period start cpu cooler instal pretty instantly let magic smoke DIY PC building bit complicated
go use razor method scrape old metal solder nervous lol post OC perf result directly cool
stuff like noctua nt h2 kingpin paste good pretty thick
copper aluminum transfer heat internally differently know retain heat differently Aluminum lose heat fast copper make well dissipate low delta T aluminum hard warm copper act short duration thermal sink aluminum long duration dissipation medium work well pure copper heatsink warm slowly dissipate energy slow
yeah hard know stop take measurement intel die lapping tool right height start scratch frame stop
not invent m sure probably know like
think fair point example clear example
derbaur good
solder mean solder die indium base solder edge glue alternative use regular thermal paste instead indium solder Intel
definitely leftover solder die final picture need heat gun silicone glue hold guitar string handle
wonder feasible LGA mount board bit high allow thin ihs time cleanly break compatibility previous platform know important retain cooler compatibility offer option use DDR4 feel like DDR4 require high spec DDR4 compatibility welcome effort cooler
not think efficiency compatibility oh great use old cooler terribad performance say compatibility hey compatible great news right right nah well buy new cooler job properly
offset mount position cooler core IHS produce inferior result compare direct die
say grain salt look graph post fishy line basicly clone temp shift ihs bad claim big difference temperature change curve say try scam ppl kind market profit think effect result see especially starting temp high cpu load hover 40c

ah ya bit small card order mm spend lot time try work beautiful build thumbs up light skin tone
wonder
wing actually different code cable ram fan GPU dial untill like fan aio R 213 G 66 B 10 GPU FF not check cable tomoorw
get Define xl reason get windowless version case damn cramped barely airflow Define xl use spare room face with tears of joy
anybody sell pc monitor sell monitor vastly people cheap
talk specific case reviewer general reputation year
remember exactly one major YT channel cover come
correct look like design single basic year old white man come free Eames chair whiskey stone like shallow trite design language mature basic mesh flow case
Impedance irrelevant need amp
external dac amp well choice imo
usually external well want stuff rig decide soundcard Fan static
uhm yeah quiet plug normal headphone jack
build control unit hook usb port yes need lian li rgb Software
bad picture try panel later road
hard technical able person
available replacement
setup bit troubleshooting process reddit platform fix
m Germany haha
think corsair rgb cable
kinda like match get 7950x3d lay ready Amazon say 7900x3d problem use etc
answer
OHHHHH ty wonderful random person internet gorgeous pc appreciate let know want play part come similar look
fun let gpu pcie cable glow gpu load cable rut hot light current
idk work great Apple
ve ready good review trust swedish site actual customer
quality good complain
basically plow release week half speak ill bracket useless
lolwut big YT channel review pretty love Steve GN talk
rgb spaceship tired have black box glow ufo standing order white oak oak shelf extra custom panel entirely hide sight invisible tech good tech
electrotechnical knowledge oscillate circuit say apprenticeship year
external dac amp combo slightly expensive 80gbp well integrated option look top dx1 fiio k3 good value option money entry level top dx3 pro plus
Aye sound card experience fan static solid sound card especially price point
understand not care not know will not try help
look well 4k perfect make game feel snappy game bad implementation tho RE4 good example
hey matter like run great job build cherry glass panel think sort clear custom panel ya like project
oh damn
Keinen problem Meine mutter st Deutschland Ich brauhe nur Euro
yeah good get to wait money month build setup
try color code look orange person vs picture kinda look like warm white light bulb color way probably nice build ve lay eye hope treat XTX Nitro look incredible build
thing Apple manufacturer stupid especially display manufacturer suddenly charge lot display people will buy upgrade entire computer
knock say beware man shrugge
Steve actually mention thin flimsy chassis depend gpu rigidity
plenty good cool looking case want pay argue shit stick like sore thumb tbh describe extensive modification blend literally plan entire room look good cohesive cause fucking garish yeah rgb spaceship suck Imo wrong black box itx build light
high impedance headphone actually draw little power compare low impedance one sensitivity factor matter high impedance high sensitivity draw power possible configuration
dx3 pro plus sit desk
look soundcard good impedance match Ohm AE 5 manage reason want extra amplifier outside case desk usually average Mainboard high impedance source
know nice looking case wood detail want black box will not fit room workstation sit know want pay spend close 5k build plus additional cash NAS storage uh think presumptuous thing know detail
like tell impedance headphone hard drive need soundcard fine choose soundcard impedance headphone reason need power
mean want wood detail basic bitch thing think good idea implement lazily North case lazer 3d elegant suffer basic fundamental design flaw wood accent simply cheesy fuck computer case specifically target white dude like actually beautifully wood case billet mill metal case far glue stick
lmao fuck wood specifically target white dude problem Fractal swedish ffs think personal racial issue figure
mean want wood detail call material preference basic bitch pretty shallow well opinion plastic lol mean want wood detail live forest living room lot oak family work lumber lot woodworking detail house result quit people like wood plastic dude lazer 3d replacement m itx shit propose fit workstation build furthermore say cheap quality case send cheap option like actually beautifully wood case billet mill metal case far glue stick prefer well actually perform
think strange comment
unfinished wood black metal cliche white man design trope literally tech bro buy Eames chair exactly like graduate college know white dude genuinely think good look
guy reply

look r amd comments 132dqry gamersnexus we have been able to reproduce a ji5gm12 comment
consumer try unreasonable thing product deny blame manufacturer OEMs anticipate fault
run 7950x heavy rendering load expo memory run month assume non 3d chip susceptible voltage problem
probably mobo maker cpu affect issue sure x3d cpu burn sensitive one voltage sensitive hardware limit mean sure happen good guess failure prevent massive voltage spike failure control voltage specifically x3d failure communicate issue remember Asus remove biose quietly fault agesa stuff manufacturer issue
die voltage simply faulty
die reason show burn mark die cpu motherboard death related problem
highly unlikely reproducible like Steve mention
r7 mobo put bio default 1 368v SOC manually reduce 1 15v shitstorm start interested overclock buy well cpu require care overclock
pretty bad check GSkill cl36 memory brother got run Gigabyte board report 1 3v think like 1 28v hear issue Gigabyte board

deafault voltage high accomodate bad cpu term silicon quality bad bin go barely ok need work system cpu obviously bad good case give cpu run low voltage default low win silicon lottery give production system cpu work binning spectrum silicon quality mobo need accomodate marker cpu tell mobo great bin ok default voltage level bad good silicon sure work reason want lower voltage lower temp prolong chip life need experiment like find low working voltage
think stable 1 2v SoC DDR5 kept crash Deep Rock Galactic turn EXPO completely
assume steve test hundred sample asus cpus test amd msi gigabyte asrock GN milk viewer
jump conclusion instantly condemn evil corporation say way way AMD fault restrict board vendor anyways
damn gigabyte board old BIOS wonder Gigabyte early

yes definitely issue extreme reason price Amazon show new version item accurate Amazon manage hundred million product listing algorithmically algorithm party seller weird thing like price beer glass k camera 35K practice rare price accurate narrow result search quality well example sub understand 7900xtx list new k sell Amazon Warehouse determine actually real new price million item
thank leave nice comment motivate hear people use site
joke shop hardware newegg great filter search find want google Amazon find Amazon listing
go Reddit search use Google find Reddit xd
recommend buy complex computer part Amazon Warehouse ok hassle test return faulty hand issue return recently return good condition motherboard bent pin click determine worth hassle saving case test motherboard waste hour wish get new well luck simple component like fan cooler
get Steelcase think v2 stain match Woolite Instant Stain remover wet dry vac pc TigerDirect Outlet Amazon Warehouse YMMV willing work experience patience fix occasional issue D
well stuff like anymore BBQ arrive crate like new BBQ
ship drive warehouse item bid pick person
Dreial2419 ebay
yeah definitely love store like find b2b sell literal truckload
plus state
depend 1800x point way perf 1800x lot low cost guess big gain see match high spec chip beat record daily
1800x pretty close peak Zen architecture achieve architecture clock high overclocke headroom low great overclock well 3600xt performance cheap chip
undervolt CO problem especially lock PBO limit express Amps Watts line pin conductor carry power single pin need carry technically pin solder pad need like Louis Rossmann u bogertonn send email know D cool yt video cpu
change voltage amperage suppose actually overvolting well thin power line resistance long distance power line volt vs home volt
far know 5900x ccd usually high quality
likely correct remember layout head reason make sense vague possibly memory interesting configuration supply issue terrible pricing 5800X initially like want 5800x launch price 5600x like 5900x like 5600x well value 5800x game need stream multi task 5900x big boy cache significantly high clock speed like capability gap 5800x 5900x huge gap 5600x 5800x minor price delta reflect opposite sell 5800x like sell remember 5800x available like day digital river store sell second minute
solder iron 3700x luckily corner edge psa Arctic MX 5 super sticky apparently legitimately like make suction cup bond try remove hot replace nh 15 Arctic Liquid Freezer II mm time socket array twist sure paste break free twist fairly easily pull come noctua cooler cpu 3700x leave outside corner pin socket lol

agree issue fuck awful well know oided buy Asus recommend like copy paste 7700x profile piss automated testing configure properly fail multiple step fucking weird consumer know voltage sensitivity Asus bother implement
turn expo not run run CL40 slow fuck use constantly cpu limited cost 10 performance basically game play max
guess raw avrage benchmark good 7800x3d game 7800x3d cost maybe pure gaming objectively match come GPU resolution play use case need upgrade x200B 13700k impressive beat 7800x3d like Warahmmer III 1440p 4k cpu go different 120hz screen similar low result 7800x3d probably well againt 13700k let year year consider upgrade x200B purely game pc 13700k clear choice buck well productivity
somebody thread MSI board vsoc 1 35v matter week early thousand board ship old bio
mate bounce move goal post point hit like different topic far repeatedly refute thing genuinely believe undervolt performance require exponentially power voltage set early silicon quality improve time give Zen2 mobile outstanding efficiency think issue
year bad run board blame RMA possible overclocking refuse RMA try great electrolytic capacitor scandal capacitor die leave right center chinese company steal formula japanese corporation manufacture ton substandard electrolytic capacitor cost saving measure
lot good alternative gaming laptop competitively price hesitate buy asus get gaming laptop maybe Lenovo place competition quality value laptop Dell HP easy look good motherboard competitive ASUS offer quality value justify price premium tier Strix gpu bad midrange asu gaming laptop price midrange ROG Strix Ti
asus laptop serve good give sister use
know issue fresh milk drip mouth wide spread furthermore fix crippling performance fear destruction pure paranoia apply reasoning hardware
hmm not find motherboard support hifh speed hmm
think unrealistic especially part get small last short time sensitivity
explain fine look like poor spec QC AMD like common theme
mean fundamentally different say void warranty activate EXPO mobo gets cook difference critical
copy mark VDDIO MC 1 35v Trident Neo Z5 spec 1 4v use
harm point performance gain worth sanity
i5 4690k slightly smiling face
thank shot
card long probably
fan RTX VR play VR probably pick rx6800
Windows fairly significant issue game time issue check bios VBS turn game loose performance
yes understand want run okay wait week stable run burn add risk assessment expo unsafe anymore new bio
mean hz 4k screen 13600k well choice go mainly gaming watt psu
vsoc story fact spike past 1 35v 4v
yup believe tail end absolutely despise ASUS grow chance right screw dead ethernet port series Ryzen thing turn blame game reason look common issue people keep chat log process fast
EXPO overclocke natural spec low like XMP DOCP DDR4 era essentially form overclocke gamer performance close benchmark unofficially recognize sweet spot matter spec DDR5 Ryzen series figure CL30 high tight instability risk increase
computer get reliable node size keep shrink reason suddenly reverse silicon chipset generally reason motherboard die usually part like capacitor vrm
yeah exactly kind Dunning Kruger genius Asus prey press release
start read VDDQ VDDIO vdd try work stable low well start 1 35v stable optimize
3d chip lot performance leave table
cost entire build probably able afford face with tears of joy
turn security feature gaming performance
850w safe area buy new personally little bit 850w purely efficiency safety get 850w 13600k okay throw sensible power limit good x200B thing 13600k theoratically performant 7800x3d 4k skewed result favour game cpu bind run high referesh rate generally game run 120hz hardpress difference 4k processor x200B good 13600k 13700k 13600k considerably cheap 7800x3d probably upgrade year x200B thing need iGPU 13600kf 13700kf slightly fast cheap
fact asus board allow 440w worth power feed dead cpu cook deconstruct layer swear ASUS clown fest issue avoid board long time remember M2N VM DH spectacularly fail set house fire VRM take shit
ok thank confuse limit like motherboard maximum limit actual ram maxium oc limit m guess ram come equal not figure ram vengace fury etc OC max EXPO EXPO profile motherboard ram
get durable reliable reason mission critical stuff usually run old hardware
thank opinion nice day
try 1 35v MC stable try vdd VDDQ stable try VDDP VDD VDDQ post clear cmos start right get MC VDD VDDQ leave VDDP Auto notice DIMM spec 1 1V VDD VDDQ curious post HWinfo say Module Voltage Nominal Operable Endurant 1 1V VDD VDDQ

chip year validate mission critical stuff eventually move new process hardly stick nm forever
leave VDDP auto vdd way low
massive issue lol idk smoke performance generational uplift
like research solid specially Arctic fan see cpu cool guess probably good 13600k x200B major thing personally WD black sn850x NVMe option considerably well sn770 pick SN850 good good option good price performance little expensive try cheap motherboard like MSI PRO Z790 instead MAG balance price little motherboard okay Z790 think gain lose z790 tho z790 p x200B yes improvment 6700k 13600k lot money pay sure win11 win10 win10 new software requirement intel x200B power hungry 13600k x200B max turbo 181w box easily bring bio MSI advanced cpu configuration low tdp cpu sit low temp time similar box performance

recession barely start bub
quarter
unemployment recession decide base gdp
consecutive quarter negative gdp 3q end number additionally metric technical definition metric consider like unemployment right plenty evidence say recession
yea technical recession time like recession lifetime massive layoff
unemployment employment recession opposite jobless recovery early 2010s
debate s right metric job market super strong
yeah people start feel heat sweat time burn
yep true like long recession lol definition thing
shape demand need hobby people partake home huge boon stimulus check
stock suffer company not company report absolutely ridiculously line profit compare normal year large s drive inflation right corporate greed pricing essentially way government stop act congress like good luck tell republican good chunk democrats congress actually try pull corporate greed
mining dude
actually simple buy gpu msrp use eth money month gamer demand small compare miner demand profitable thing happen Nvidia year
chip shortage help stock help drive price volume manufacturer continue sell MSRP distribution retail get extra revenue chip shortage hurt stock help
sure say Intel good position hold market share falter def Zen come point time
damn corporation profit go shareholder sell stock
have record profit past quarter
time line physically ruin good mood absolutely fuck disgusting record corporate profit record inflation mention sentence
spend money consumer good service
record profit tho Intel lose money Nvidia lose revenue AMD lose revenue
actually lie stock base compensation
company
executive bonus probably great think give usually stock lose valuation company generally public company leadership matter external factor
Xilinx great long term
look trading volume deal close mid February noticeable change compare normal volume deal volume meaningless matter direction depth ask bid side conversion stock set rate case AMD share xilinx share yes Xilinx trade slightly value stock recieve arbitrage trade company issue stock yes stock exist AMD purchase Xilinx exist trade effect exactly AMD raise capital trough stock issuance pay cash
oh god know well dick

yeah agree atrocious digit indicate architecture generation
say care naming scheme mean AMD like 8530u casually look laptop think oh series zen4 AM5 actuality zen3 chip unnecessarily overcomplicated easy intentionally unintentionally mislead customer number indicate chip architecture standard place decade change like suspect good
problem AMD make new chip base old architecture dedicate low end budget entry level laptop naming scheme design intentionally fool consumer think get late processor look Asus zenbook 14x sure series series series come 7x30u mean new actually bad literally market laptop year ago late Mindfvck honestly edit paragraph wrong 14x different
understand exact roughly equivalent desktop name prefix indicate mobile cpu suffix indicate Form Factor TDP variant fucking idea marketing real work
Zen Zen Zen product actual fuck mean happy Ryzen 1600AF 3500U zen absolutely insane Ryzen series cpu architecture see Ryzen series screw Ryzen mobile cpu zen utterly scummy
need guide figure buy clear new naming AMD favor seemingly design obfuscate consumer actually buy separate mobile processor family different processor architecture different manufacturing process mix graphic technology year differing o memory offering take paragraph lead reader AMD announce mobile ryzen space go wrong
laptop basically part vary greatly like oooh laptop 140W version 50W version let dig massive pile documentation vague answer
go rid excess inventory zen etc confuse vast majority informed consumer think get late name series Brillant
People AMD thing swear destroy
justification new scheme baffle corpos think dumb
nah well 5500u 5600u fiasco zen zen know gen buy segment utterly useless
Idk like kinda make sense
consumer laptop manufacturer market absolute new part new cpu architecture update old part predecessor architecture look like year old processor easy update laptop chassis 6800hs 7830h look like SoCs offer tangible upgrade like Zen RDNA2 old cpu architecture Silicon lead edge expensive Zen mobile likely reach mid range series order hit market price point mix architecture lithography node
find pretty easy understand honestly give useful info intel
AMD borrow bad idea Intel
chart contradict Ryzen desktop release model avoid additional confusion
digit make perfect sense admittedly intuitive different architecture generation like hear well solution solution thrid digit intuitively differntiate new old release generation way suboptimal probably scheme way

stupid self aggrandize overwrought product management nonsense see AMD quickly adopt bad trait Intel Nvidia stop
well alternative proper legend hand customer know architecture oppose previous naming scheme customer search individual cpu find zen2 zen3 case point 5700u 5800u different architecture different chip
like amd Nvidia go bonker shit big redflag come AMD see name different laptop gpu base model 6800 6800S 6700 6700S piece hardware different physical component name way Nvidia try new 4080 back amd cpu naming scheme amd supporter Intel screw antitrust b cheer recent rise power decade like suppose intel arm time

go admit idea right thing actually imagine make complicated cpu GPU die laptop failure rate meet target frequent acceptable desktop thing like TDP cool requirement die space etc way optional desktop segment throw shitload cpu rubbish fit right category e g core unstable 15w sell core 15w need way sell inventory imagine sku desktop need dozen sku model price segment sense old gen high core count part cheap system etc s lot use case cater sell factor OEMs want business sellable solution readily manufacturer like Intel people actually suggest good system handle Zen stuff inadequate make sense desktop high margin error allow stringent OEM demand legit loss need implement mobile market
guy smart system
google chip computer buy

happen hire market people domain knowledge
reasoning new number scheme sense good basis thing bring complicated tech savvy have hard time grasp new look reference chart like intel naming scheme mobile shetshow need streamline sku bloated product segmentation cause confusion consumer
swap market segment architecture position system start make sense deceptive example line up 9590 vs 9950 9570 9750 9550 9630 9530 9550 9360 9520 9330 9350 9250 9330 9220 9220

get bad 7520U sound like midrange chip number reasonably assume Zen cpu cu RDNA3 instead Zen chip mere cu RDNA2 call Ryzen take piss barely deserve Ryzen branding Ryzen 5400U well way despite digit low
people fool naming scheme people look number anyways performance figure laptop part weird like dell XPS laptop long ago dual core i7 think currently laptop run 35watts indication new AMD naming scheme actually pretty good sure weird enthusiast care look chart exactly get functional average consumer accidentally buy completely outdated computer
zenbook different 14x refresh Zenbook 5825u Barcelo 7730U Barcelo R zenbook 14x w Ryzen refresh
intentionally fool consumer think get late processor late processor digit year high new obviously sort late processor use well tech AMD scheme imho good compromise important AMD OEMs machine carry AMD chip able sell machine laptop year cpu cpu average consumer avoid perfect need hobbyist professional like actually care exactly confuse dig detail benchmark
7x30u mean probably exact 6xxxu zen3 chip year downgrade real upgrade zen3 zen3 share single digit silly way downgrade DDR4 base laptop require new motherboard design motherboard year apu trick people Mendocino basically chromebook Mendocino like physical size 5800u cheap compete Pentiums i3s end
weird stuff like Mendocino RDNA2 iGPU 3600m 3100 m exist mobile release quad core Zen RDNA2 old take
make miss oh old pentium ii mhz neat hear Pentium mhz come later year 1ghz believe
important factor buy mobile cpu ST performance MT performance graphic performance power efficiency price AMD new lineup reuse one target point quick easy way compare way GPU like Nvidia AMD honest mobile GPU name

imo image probably key digit mean people wonder digit start way go Zen1 series port arch nm work benefit
enthusiast think average consumer rarely care architecture product buy care offer good performance efficiency money AMD want sell Zen cpu ultra low end fine enthusiast know leave table mom need machine send email browse Facebook fine laptop cheap real issue anti consumer naming scheme trick enthusiast think cpu modern architecture naming clear low end sku nearly good Zen stuff problem
I m curious voltage 1600AF need 3 8ghz far reasonable voltage
magic chiplet mix match work
buy 1600af small factor example AMD Ryzen R1600 DS923 NAS
actual fuck fabbe different factory happen plenty capacity cheap price

man bad long different desktop counterpart wattage easily available understand away
excess inventory newly produce chip
Zen chip
excess inventory make new chip year old core
corpos think dumb think know mobile laptop lineup I e mass majority sell average joe jane walk Best Buy need laptop choose number honestly enthusiast member issue day have graphic handy walk able tell let average joe jane
specifically know public dumb people super tech focusse average person need new laptop think high number well start number know digit indicate tech year old anti consumer
think modern cpu come mems base iq sensor know dumb
matter smart market segment number pure fuckery

think series chip RDNA2 RDNA3 graphic use old number laptop maker reason age properly discontinue old model Zen RDNA2 chip customer buy old Vega inferior
Intel naming scheme good near ridiculous misleading
go intel naming scheme
Intel name gibberish naming scheme mean decode
believe chart mobile chip
probably Mobile segment

want add append end value sort relevance silly order like let honest purpose trick people misunderstand cpu value
name key difficult find consider AMD disseminate consumer benefit follow subreddit religiously odd know name key exist
naming scheme apply laptop
exactly point average person go buy new laptop think high number well start number know digit indicate tech year old entirely design sell old tech new tech price people know well anti consumer
misplace outrage you truly defend
previous generation similar cpu large number significant AKA denote late generation architecture information toss middle buy 7xxx laptop get old gen arch
digit irrelevant digit important digit relate optimal numbering system architecture core count market segment revision year tdp space appropriately digit particular core count remain fix generation revision year allow zen2 release update year
information available think go to handy chart hang right laptop want buy eh lol
digit tech generation simply incremente year
consumer especially uninformed consumer usually look high cpu number laptop buy historically work fine problem naming scheme 7540U hugely outperform 7620u example consumer go chart know exist know AMD actually sell allow model low number significantly well know actually go Zen zen chiplet simple fact naming scheme allow scenario low number cpu perform well make system bit dumb convoluted
like game clock gpu rolling on the floor laughing
nah well 5600u 5700u diff arct dirrentiator
core architecture important thing argue important thing form factor alphabetical character probably stand important relative performance compare laptop basically need generation chip significant digit relative performance generation significant core architecture somewhat irrelevant include informed buyer guess come significant digit somewhat nonsensical imo
Ryzen 8xxx instead 7xxx
subject rename Alder Lake cpu gen Alder Lake chip rebadge gen AMD buy mean learn read
consumer purposefully misleading sell old tech new tech price people know tech absolutely inside completely anti consumer
weirdo invest emotion thing buy
old core architecture Zen
easy ryzen well Ryzen rest number letter mumbo jumbo
yeah bit stupid maybe gen want Ryzen chip
let ask ryzen ryzen totally arbitrary like
Ryzen 6900HS watt Ai way
like Intel naming scheme

alternative stay naming scheme sell mendocino zen2 ryzen 8200u low end phoenix range zen4 8300u
basically start digit architecture want sku later architecture use number disadvantage not mislead trick technically inclined customer think get current gen product good number mean bin generation r3 R5 etc leave high low bin extra digit denote refreshe special bin room sku right bat architecture add plus feature isolation instance digit barely letter end fine perfectly usable naming scheme decade future proofing understand accommodate dusin bin cpu tier architecture refreshe special high low end part way worried segmentation incapable make chip lets work certain power segment obviously go release work architecture engineer scale TDP bin defective GPU core defective cpu core etc nigh different way bin fit r3 R5 etc category bin need fitting difficult edit important note clock speed finalize bin silicon launch core count clock speed etc start try find silicon fit handle product create obviously fit product announce existing foundry suddenly produce bad silicon time think happen perfectly fine
think problem change officially time laptop cpu leapfrog desktop year actually gen product etc people like series Zen randomly choose use naming scheme anymore series Zen part digit 3 5 7 mean Zen reason official change instantly back corner reach Zen want confusing introduce letter prioritize model year leading digit like misleading series Zen chip highly criticise likely go to change time damning perfectly good scheme exist essentially couple year
naming scheme laptop desktop

true OEM selling AMD OEM want
People tell difference cpu google people barely tell difference Amd Intel basically manufacturer aside Apple absolutely ridiculous naming scheme not persuade live person think 14ALC05 S2721HN reasonable product name
AMD Intel actually put model number
like store sell Ryzen laptop plenty model list cpu number look store website plenty consumer got trick series naming scheme difference regular i7 TGL i7 lot store completely incompetent salesperson know care difference processor
forget
good digit arbitrary marketing number translate arbitrary marketing number
messy probably bin Zen3 zen3 apart designation plus letter suffix AMD milk extra cash extra branding sticker differentiate u series efficiency u series gaming RDNA graphic sell different model different process node way increase supply market
OEMs pretend fresh lineup year
quadcore Zen4 high number 8core zen3 singular number system faithfully represent complexity processor performance name system abuse
rest world
understand people think month day year horrible
year performance small update rebrand chip increase number barely change performance sense Ryzen bad ryzen

yeah say
BFU mean
yeah Intel seriously
talk amd Intel stupid shit not amd well stupid
well go big blue country consider ALD RPL near identical IPC amd bs bad base RPL frequency L3 core count perform near identical ALD main benefit RPL high frequency headroom mean locked chip get performance Intel try pass low performance chip well probably bother create low cc RPL variant simply gain
intel naming scheme know big number fast cpu generation AMD sell series CPU big number s bit slow series cpu digit important
exactly Intel name cpu 13900 700 500 300 year revision XXX high well
confusing potentially misleading naming scheme okay affect enthusiast amazing argument think
agree problem friend not know AMD thing know intel i3 i5 i7 knowledge generation not feel right easily brand away market old stuff new one aware business buy laptop maybe s new normal lol intel nvidia shady especially CES

actually look Intel mobile cpu sort laptop use Intel cpu headache number letter use previous generation example AMD difference platform letter series desktop letter X G Mobile H HS U Desktop series mobile series U low power HS mid power h high power R5 3600X desktop R5 4600H laptop simple high performance variant target platform look op AMD literally take Intel complex obfuscate
yeah like scheme kind dumb well mobile series place graphic process node
believe correct naming desktop cpu like asinine mind fuckery edit easy advantage average person store pick new laptop
ah make sense complicated
Laypeople allways look I3 I5 I7 number mean like serial number toaster care care concrete spec like person say excuse amd behavior people say average person care honest
average person look model number period look price screen size aesthetic lucky sensible consumer seek advice review case issue moot
wager average person care cpu number regardless
theory happen think Zen image list people confuse digit start accord site Athlon Zen
you truly offend

Caveat emptor
cpu architecture thing gets improve example 5700U paper chip 4800U boost higher matured process advanced power saving feature multi threading
consumer responsibility inform blindly think big number well
problem naming scheme 7540U hugely outperform 7620u example consumer go chart know exist People understand problem people feign ignorance pretend ok not like AMD getting criticize want defend
high number well processor 4800U fast 5400u high number indication new architecture naming honest simple have 5800U zen3 5700U zen2
problem naming scheme 7540U hugely outperform 7620u will happen digit primary performance indicator outperform misname digit primarily efficiency indicator
view digit extension digit like model bin well tbh switch digit digit year architecture tier year Architecture Market Segment Model segment

buy 7700x soon launch smiling face with tear thank amd
Phenom II X4 Black serve year board look like 3900x x570 got to upgrade worth
use computer work am5 platform cost justify well productivity enthusiast cut edge hobby price matter reason am5 game maybe minimal fps loss cpu like 5800x3d Better invest am5 money buy well gpu am5 mature cheap need big fps gain
wait a620
future hello duh
sell go AMD small form factor build 7600X 3d update year good ITX board hard find ASUS B650E stock instead go 13700k MSI z790 board available hope gen time AMD time

give upset people get support motherboard generation product suspect try amortise long support lifespan upfront slight sarcasm probably think likely upgrade board upfront
main reason upgrade AM5 2600X upgrade plan spring AM5 mobo price combine insane DDR5 price end go 5900x

dsh3 card highway robbery mark
yeah cheap x570 board little bit
recall B550 buy Strix B550 F launch day board today year later

cheap board feature great
distant past AMD LGA chip struggle remember

depend feature feature x570 board good deal a620 board cheap B650 mid level board cheap board amd lineup right AM4 motherboard say consider AM4 complimentary AM5 instead replacement continue support literally fast cpu gaming 5800x3d board good performance consider year cpu support AM5 think worth pay little extra consider get feature mid level x570 board
agree b650 mistake B650E funny variant pcie lane start a620 board start joke mean Literally mobo cost rumor low price 7600X b650 generally look price 7600x fly fuck vrm tier tier b650e bad cost premium glorified B550 board DDR5 LGA
Am5 board generally well price look actual quality board especially vrm 150usd b650 M board ASRock power phase
AMD say chipset compatibility drag kick scream time AM4 get idea able upgrade motherboard cpu
yeah right option buy new lga1700 end support gen intel new socket spend motherboard able upgrade cpu
year platform support vs AMD claim support vacuous define actually mean
funny bring Nvidia relevant way draw attention away bad AMD value
Lmao ddr4 yeah ASRock board way build vrm price good value far issue bio sleep issue got fix month ago personally get x670e steel legend originally go grab msi board see well value ASRock happy buy tier time window x670e board cheap regular x670 board couple b650 board

motherboard manufacturer say board come B650
hey stock asu site right assume know read ask recently spamme people realize ask month ago edit oh god get excited read end message say get z790 board WHELP
misunderstand say say say aim year guarantee year obvious reason AM4 promise support
Hope EU legislation spice thing bit world
sort price ascending
shitty AM4 board run 5950x performance degradation say intel 12900k 13900k
boot like second sleep issue fix hear video card work monitor issue talk motherboard anymore
issue early AM4 board limited memory capacity BIOS fix go issue AM5 board sub overrun overly negative misinformed post comment AMD lately wth go
report motherboard manufacturer go release motherboard soon
say AMD presentation Ryzen series
AM4 cpu top chart gaming beat new expensive AM5 CPU
AMD board for 60 Newegg remember AMD consider AM4 low end platform
indicate reduce platform longevity AM4 promise till deliver 5800x3d
Wth mean opposite write AM5 motherboard pack new advanced feature currently cheap board feature like Power Phase vrm Gb Ethernet hdmi usb3 2 gen2 type c channel audio etc low end AM5 currently feature mid end x570
release new toilet paper sell local grocery store cost cent roll reality price sheet year straight anger customer year release finally set price originally promise definitely sketchy stuff cent roll problem

perfect storm multiple factor DDR5 somewhat difficult route DDR4 especially prove widely tech mean board extra layer development time etc definitely high r d cost gen BOM price go significantly availability economy scale depress somewhat discrete component manufacturer OEM want leave sit huge stock component economy crash lead manufacturer component integrated product pad margin preparation expect severe cost cutting drop sale near future margin couple gen AM4 motherboard razor thin partially extreme backwards forwards compatibility platform price extremely attractive sell surprised big boy let happen go price potential future lose revenue skip upgrade probably wrong factor play sure impact
hypothesis mobo manufacturer put margin board promise long AM5 support basically force update old AM4 board right launch run series cpu probably anticipate Ryzen launch upfronte money instead try chase upgrade
probably charge will need buy want upgrade cpu couple year sell sell expensive
r d retooling high failure rate sale QC low sale volume
advanced knowledge partner price point reason like probably series suggest start board available start available purchase
euro not decent number usb port half decent audio chip board thank
board notice DSH3 historically low end cheap option board incredibly overpriced

motherboard new dosent mean cpu
nice
seriously doubt cost produce 7950x AMD need substantially stay fight provide competition Intel NVidia AMD come long way near bankrupt condition tough road go forward
AMD pretty open margin
depend feature depend mainstream non hedt platform need eventual budget cpu survive base price motherboard absolutely insane ridiculous AM4 board borderline acceptable absolute low tier similar intel find straight fucking delusional BARREL board
agree People mention board ridiculously overkill overbuilt
probably true think build longevity durability support future cpu mind end cost little end save user money long run
well not basic stuff generation miss cmos reset 7segment display pci lane buggy bio wierd boot time problem hey get wifi wonder money spend board basic stuff vanish XD
main issue chipset compatibility limitation BIOS capacity limited early board fix new BIOSes large capacity ensure compatibility future cpu AM4 promise support end support long AM5 promise support aim year guarantee far ahead
context use mean new cpu come go support AM4 end make new cpu rumor go release new X3D cpu AM4 low end cpu
make point perspective look broad view get expensive day inflation thing greedy company like Nvidia add greediness tax bad inflation add class video card complain
DDR4 error Newegg write
agree one go batshit crazy pricing think x670e Steel Legend good overall value board AM5 far expensive come month b650 range thing improve big time fair gigabyte decent look b650 rn
Woahhh x670e build AM5 rig week ago manage snag b650e Steel Legend open box luckily problem mobo aside hiccup boot cuz bolt cooler hard despite suspicious look pin socket
different product different peple upgrade cycle year high longevity matter year low save new motherboard huge cost saver
pair pair upgrade go wrong get 6700xt pass weekend processor run upgrade not know long
fantastically detailed reply upvote put time username thegreatcomputerguy
sad mix sad but relieved face
anecdotally upgrade pc zen3 cpu exist x370 longevity AM4 valuable big downside pcie feature need nice need pay think AMD shoot foot offer pcie round 6xx chipset come forward feature compatability complete
people know AM4 actually start Zen cpu available AM4 excavator cpu Bristol Ridge variety Athlon X4s A6 A8 A10 A12 motherboard BIOS update literrally Athlon X4 5800x3d a320 motherboard
Am4 last long consumer outcry AMD publicly intend end support lot soon
agh watch site launch availability late Con buy non upgradeable platform pro optimize adopt platform am6
maybe heavy lifting doubt AM4 rationale happen AM5 ridiculous
green pcb AM5 board anyways
5950x performance degradation wow misinformation upvote
pls spread misinformation
boot time x670e Hero 7900X second bio second Windows login screen boot take like minute memory training lock fast platform

get 3950x u think worthy upgrade well upgrade couple year Gpu go ITX build lol
compare choice amazing dude lol literally opt opt
nice hear check mobo BIOS update mobo support 3600mhz ram throw hand ram feel spendy
AMD know publicly state minimum price responsibility promise price point exist
fair DDR4 great like DDR3 great like DDR2 great take couple year generation memory sort
yea wait till price drop supply demand complaint limited impact good spend energy profitable endeavor
thing decent motherboard audio chip
let way amd zen3 refresh n6 stick 3d cache entire lineup well buy shit point incentive buy amd product good incentive entire product stack notch 7600x core 4core 100usd core right bad deal cost like 8core office task eliminate 6core tier good r3 r5 r5 r7
gen ds3h well feature user need riptide m buck gen5 m2
apparently permanently sale
well time early release rough surprise remember shift ddr3 ddr4 pricy compare predecessor right away relatively new
B550 start like sure add part high start price wrong announce
am4 ddr4 board expensive
cheap intel board pcie x16 DDR5 ASUS h610m c CSM low end board tuf b660 pcie x16 ddr5 cheap AMD motherboard Asrock b650e PG riptide ish AM5 board offer pcie4 0 x16 case DS3H Oof
cheap triple
expect probably go release price look price board Lees feature compare cheap board
Bruhs want buy Ferraris toilet paper certainly complain
yes course mean 90 swear remember AMD make LGA chip know Sun Intel get credit idea

motherboard new cpu honest question
man x570 cpu ryzen new
x370 r7 1800x rtx rig run well ps5 content roommate own ps5 jealous gaming setup graphically speak real world validation urge upgrade anymore upgrade am4 mobo cpu take dump build rig originally bad AIO cooler r5 1600x b350f rx580 gb originally reasonably price 4k 120hrtz monitor goal price come
oh believe good guy Lisa Su relate w Nvidia ceo lmao
think miss point AM5 high end mid range platform want low end platform AM4 currently cheap AM5 mobo exactly low end board pack spec feature mid range x570 board cheap version board drop feature list 1gb ethernet instead use Wifi normal board audio HDMI instead care motherboard go use GPU low end support come year a620 like market instead high end mid range board
go x670e board figure memory overclocking well future confident fine drop flagship zen cpu b650 board gigabyte one kind cheap
cmos reset annoyed segment display kind useless ryzen bios buggy boot time normal boot long anymore personally care vrm memory headroom determine future proof PCB count board encouraging people go need pcie slot m 2 slot b650 board
limitation easily circumvent release different BIOS image different generation problem board avoid AMD want initial launch promise lip service significantly change language AM5 hoodwink lot people include obvious delete comment AMD multinational corporation like money generation CPU move high margin strategy like Intel simpe get promise critical deserve hurt feeling
i e come read tea leave writing define actually commit
AMD greedy company objectively fan
laugh newegg freak lazy site big problem
one go batshit crazy pricing time mention call conspiracy theorist dead obvious non nvidia partner huge loss series Pegatron good supplier deal bulk componentry cheap
cheap b650 see gigabyte crappy vrm compare offering certain brand price probably future gaming tier cpus people buy price point b650 M ASRock go rn power phase
sale local store Taiwan move unfortunately pay 600usd 7900x mixed bag end spend PCPartpicker build fulvoussky explain want look
yeah curious AMD future chipset foresee DDR6 PCIe consumer chipset till AM6 actually surprised X870 PCIe support like standard long like
yeah learn month ago mention Zen specifically say AM4 way reinforce good AM4 suspect AM5 likely similar value
AMD intention end support promise support mainly limited memory early motherboard space support cpu find fix go promise pat instead mile well Intel offer AM5 limitation BIOS promise support say aim
evidence indication
funnily bios update think month ago say fix know mean 2d monitor issue
issue promise chipset support promise socket support intend update clearly exactly promise support AM4 chipset support go promise say promise support AM5 aim BIOS limitation long issue chipset support long issue confuse chipset limitation BIOS limitation chipset issue support AM4 limited space BIOS early AM4 motherboard find fix AM5 motherboard limit sure intent spread misinformation
yeah people get mad b650 pricing realize build like z x series board previous generation hopefully a620 bad people join am5 lonely
tech press report month
entry level board AMD available different brand chipset
Enig AM4 amd current low end say consider AM4 complement AM5 replacement Lisa Su say recent presentation go continue support AM4 future mean couple month ago rumor new X3D cpu come AM4 low end cpu surprised actually mean continued support AM4 huge instal user base ludicrous advantage
board right close cheap board currently cheap announce board come soon cheap currently available board build Power Phase vrm Gb Ethernet hdmi usb3 2 gen2 type c channel audio etc low end AM5 currently feature mid end x570 cheap board surely few feature go fine need feature like need HDMI go use GPU go use wifi matter 1gb ethernet People avoid go fine future cpu extreme overclocking obviously go want beefier know
people avoid
think definitely worth upgrade 5800x3d game 3900x go upgrade 5800x3d snappy system performance Zen amazing Vcache help game especially game require lot computational power like MS Flight Sim Asetto Corsa WoW Factorio etc power efficient 3950X mean
depend use case decent upgrade notably low upgrade worth sort user decide
depend application big graphic card advantage x3D pay Alao productivity performance look example upgrade
huge 7700x basically 5800x3d term gaming sure go 3950x 7700x night day fps pretty game double game triple like valorant
huge upgrade gaming extra core strong single core perf freq help peoductivity
buy current GPU will big difference pop current generation certainly get 5800x3d extend life system year
s graphic card x200B currently maxe average fps will increase frame pace significantly well
go 3700x 5800x3d game see fps gain play simulator cpu heavy stuff difference check benchmark play
get fps jump game go 3950x 5800x3d sure sufficient cooling run hot series
get fps increase 1440p 3950x sure sufficient cooling run hot series
pretty significant gaming workload depend game typically play significant improvement fps smoothness
CL16
ok respond question justified reason price high
maybe think a620
oh shut x200B stop act like goddamn victim
exist exist way AMD lawyer let advertise price point have normal company tactic chance board price point minimal produce think like statement true possibility board niche market hardly hear question OEM Scummy yea company course shock morally right
true forget pci e x1 slot include slot add gpu cover day make unusable
reason eliminate core good chuck em r3 forget R9 exist
r3 core reason disable half ccd yield good note know core ccd
Delete core core core price
damn board single m 2 pcie5 slot know x16 slot optional think m 2 pcie5 require look build like generation board little money
ddr5 right cheap ddr4 year ago price
surprise remember shift ddr3 ddr4 pricy compare predecessor right away yeah happen generation major evolution instead refresh
B550 year late market x570 option age
notice hit big financial crash mix massive inflation normal crash stuff Stonks FTX fallout bad
short memory B550 delay long time X570 option cheep b550 year year B550 come
buy intel
yeah inflation new socket lot money plus time AMD go LGA repurpose old tool like usually PGA PGA LGA LGA AMD push cpu price sell product cost 7950x run 5950x release
burger cost 10 Times change nonsense
motherboard literally good one People whine price point 90 remember claim able buy board haha
look intel intel AMD swap place today intel value option AMD intel DDR4 mobo cheap relay good cpu low cost AMD move intel year charge intel performance wait year price drop
whoda thunk completely new technology new socket expensive old technology old socket
yeah board tech year literally late tech available account inflation increase cost literally independently inflation elss
far think remember reason Intel get credit adopt LGA socket consumer use know market company Intel utilize socket consumer face product likely expensive manufacture 1990 2000s
old motherboard go bad get pretty good deal new simple
old pc work cpu upgrade especially onboard graphic valueable
x370 r7 1800x rtx rig run well ps5 content look weak PS5 way
AM5 directly replace AM4 new AM4 board develop new AM4 cpu develop support slow surely go fade AM4 low end platform gen platform AM4 cheap byproduct old low end
want low end platform AM4 obviously confused
limitation easily circumvent release different BIOS image different generation problem board avoid AMD want initial launch promise lip service fix end go exactly BIOSes affected motherboard end replace cpu support new one flash BIOS offer probably service borrow cpu flash BIOS significantly change language AM5 hoodwink lot people include obvious delete comment start weird hoodwink delete comment AMD multinational corporation like money generation CPU move high margin strategy like Intel course like make money start hold company boycott Nike learn like money multinational bad thing nvidia evil multinational evil evil thing AMD high margin strategy course high margin medium margin low margin strategy remember AM4 go promise support future state clearly consider low end platform cheap AM4 motherboard 5800x3d month ago hear people sub r amd overrun people pay talk trash AMD start realize wrong think overly negative comment base wrong information overwhelming
come read tea leave please know mean support context
see greed AMD overtake Intel Zen price core previously try pull Zen cut price AMD manage beat Nvidia gpus AMD saint 7900xt cut flagship 6800xt want charge conveniently change justify high price like Nvidia difference overpriced
yeah player day use stock stuff release Amazon hide stuff release price high good Buy sku pc builder Microcenter helpful store store nearby pretty sad state affairs tbh
Newegg suck spec right component shopping Amazon terrible People listing throw buzzword header
true think conspiracy different think Intel bribe board partner incentivize z790 board cheap AM5 mean ddr4 lineup equivalent board usually cheap
go to hard time prove price rig
definitely look kinda interested
like ask objective fact agree misinformation like hear TL DR AM4 prove AMD commitment socket support specifically mean chipset support agree AMD go way support old chipset new cpu need say start right correct AMD go critical understand want avoid pr issue try gain market share time long point fact correct misunderstanding AM4 unwilling update mobo take combine effort AMD AIBs guarantee want word marketing advantage people hop platform matter motherboard gb flash board chipset limitation clearly state update mean limitation lack support evidently put word mouth misrepresent pick straw form argument support chipset support chipset lack driver bio hardware compatibility optimistic see reality history negative want claim negative fine go argue moot point care change objective fact safely claim current AMD chipset support edit clear matter company BMW flip switch free heat seat want increase competitive offer free trial free Intel software lock purchase unlock cpu feature future add option road technically possible make business sense give point
want wild plausibly hang zen4 chiplet AM4 DDR4 o die technical limitation way chiplet talk socket ram directly talk o die speak Infinity Fabric imagine limitation voltage relate power link regulate power Zen4 whathaveyou
forget x370 board likely questionable power delivery compare b450 especially b550 5950x ok run 5900x typo 5900x consume power low silicon quality 5900x draw power cinebench 5950x pbo2 enable
got to gpu advantage 5700xt likely bottle neck point
get slight dilemma bro build wanna wait AM5 x3d mth get to settle mid range b650e board like b650e e strix x3d price unknown 5800x3d pair high end board reuse RAM use 7700x hynix M die gb cost diff vs 5800x3d build 325 est AM5 x3d sure worth upgrade mid AM5 cycle s need
Niiicey 2666mhz r7 check hand offering
sure want folk lose sight AMD
victim will buy overpriced motherboard prefer lie
care pcie card damn slot use riser annoying totally solveable issue
yea pcie spacing issue long solve
eliminate r9 say core bad say terrible middle ground expensive overkill everthing customer well serve core
probably kill cache
require regular b650 chipset yeah
chip shortage ram ssd price skyrocket
actually fairly reasonably price expensive DDR4 price affordable
b450 twice expensive waaaay inflation
greed man stop try parrot corporate justification
inflation new socket justify kind price increase
z370 asrock board good feature euro equivalent Z690 cost atleast euro motherboard manufacturer rip like
burger cost year ago
Burger cost 10 year ago
cheap motherboard barrel A320s B450s etc say
DDR jump cost drop shock price drop o feel old DDR ram
AM4 board dirt cheap platform new component get expensive AIB try surf wave super expensive hardware covid shortage
award credit go
socket upgrade probably serve 5800x3d gaming lot thread em available cheap
1800x huge bottleneck x200B recently upgrade 5800x coudnt stand 60fps cpu bottle neck old title 100fps 5800x nearly double fps super
talk room mate tell play Yo bro look well ps5 truth well paper have screen tear cap 60fps buttery smooth 120fps plus make difference plus way ps5 render graphic pc version render texture naked eye ps5 inside comparably speak run hardwear idk weak system compare lmaoo
graphic intensive game like Dwarf Fortress run pc PS5 user bow rig run DF 4k ah long till DF come steam hype real DF action
yeah upgrade AF nm zen refresh aka XFX RX580 8gb RX6600 8gb little core absolutely outperform PS5 metric leave dust
current line motherboard cpu will disappear suddenly think currently available product available probably year AM4 huge instal user base ludicrous AMD drop support ignore people look 5800x3ds sell right people upgrade AM4 system replace new motherboard cpu questionable know rumor go release new X3D cpu low end cpu am4 guess CES Lisa Su say recent presentation plan support AM4 future mean
actually
understand buy shit especially gpus Amazon search computer component filter garbage throw buzzword list product have relic year ago look Nvidia gpus site good know exactly look Best Buy suck local one stock card 6600xt Nvidia gpus year
yeah live Florida microcenter option bestbuy practically useless luckily good hold i7 8700 rx580 build need ram problem
obviously understand happen AiBs AMD properly maybe educate actually happen instead angrily argue correctly state course event typically promise cpu manufacturer past getting spoiled complain plain silly great thing generation complain state internet long weird
case slightly depend tier card go gpu big jump fast stretch genuine gaming cpu go 5800x3d feel identical current setup gpu bottleneck
exact combo plan upgrade soon
necessarily game limit cpu way improve cpu help difference low upgrade 5600x 5800x3d feel way smooth gain maybe fps average 3070ti gpu cpu bind scenario 10x well
factually lie 5700xt upgrade cpu absolutely gain fps gpu game graphic workload run cpu mention gpu gets tell cpu common knowledge know computer actually work clip new gpu like 7900xtx limit cpu handle game new gpu 3950x 6900xt 7700 6900xt double fps title minimum game 4x fps valorant cs league legend overwatch performance table AMD cpu hold gaming 5800x3d serie product AMD match intel gaming beat game buddy 2700x upgrade 7700x keep fps double title play gpu slow baseline new performance double period 60fps 120fps double valorant go 200fps 450fps slightly double go 90fps 180fps title double gain valorant go average average peak 900fps time yes gain big gpu fast baseline wa high big issue AMD fan ignorant quality cpu love AMD team red 1800x launch upgrade 3950x 7700x time know buy intel double fps not like intel product preference take performance hit know amd good gaming long meme amd compete gaming
Noctua NH d15 yeah cooler 80c
6800xt reference model
think point finger motherboard manufacturer retailer AMD see AMD basically direct control pricing
core minimum need maintain high performance Games fine case core improve performance need adjust pricing hierarchy launch price number core CCX contain core recently reduce pricing little
eliminate r9 lol address hedt market address Threadripper people buy motherboard blink happy drop band processor People focused value end market forget pay bill
core ultimate sweet spot tier cpu will hinder game performance have Discord open
core cpu L3 core
logistics cost go electricity go silicon go retooling cost lot especially scale especially especially LGA capacitor go term cost pcb go Mobos lotta epoxy go copper go huge nickel coal price triple mean electricity cost mean cost literally layer production electricity cost go product cost go company company need increase additively multiplicatively work business tell know adjacent industry
electricity raw material hundred
idk place like actually cheap place fast food combo idk burger
say alright way hell legitimately fucking dense good
sdr DDR4 fairly cheap issue thst stuff controller lot go run new hardware hardware
sorry guess actually know real reason Intel get credit think wrong thing big business trade secret maybe long time socket AMD trouble remember find Wikipedia Socket F 8 15 2006 design AMD Operton line server workstation cpu modify version socket name socket FX AMD Socket l1 NVIDIA 11 30 2006 AMD Quad FX platform think last year surprised trouble recall socket type
yeah socket upgrade lot value onboard graphic series
little core absolutely outperform PS5 metric simply true hardware PS5 superior way
Lmao nice fairytale bro
question irrelevant insinuate presumably expect AMD support old platform eternity say slowly surely nuke AM4 system planet reply rumor time rumor credibility leaker say info available July July anymore plan go forward AMD involve AM5 apparent rumor sense Intel make LGA cpu
agree Amazon pretty hot garbage day hate commingle party inventory knock devolve different Wish case careful
5800x3d feel well go series pretty massive improvement term frame pacing responsiveness upgrade cpu good go to able feed new grapphic card properly backwards time
typically correct 3d cache make significant improvement game intention definitely noticeable increase performance recent GPU reason cpu gen cpu
give e sport game example game will not difference GPU bit fast 2700x main thing hold gpu
yeah intel double FPS rolling on the floor laughing cpu go to double fps specific scenario look Benchmark will pull fps ass buy late cpu
control yeah point finger mobo manufacturer
say cost core cost core money absolute middle road computing game dual quad core sense budget option problem Year Lord argument computing need consumer justify change core layout product stack reason Intel quad core i7s long tiny minority people want core ok HEDT quad core satisfied power user quad core fine gaming
say core bad say 7600x msrp horrible value 7600x sure 4core zen4 5ghz well carry till series exist gpu well purchase
Amd ruin threadripper hope intel compete soon
proper hedt platform quad channel gen5 lane dedicate nvme
AM4 board AM5 start price high end motherboard year ago
remember vividly post meme x570 pricing subreddit get upvote minute got ban xd criticism die B550 arrive decently price board Euro range
value igpu non G Zen cpu capable game whatsoever significantly weak igpu find AM4 cpu actually want use iGPU troubleshoot g
5600x XT gen
honestly think AMD drop AM4 like big instal user base plenty user look upgrade realistic plan likely reasonable expect wise thing huge instal user base support abundantly clear consider AM5 new high end mid range platform am4 low end platform low end AM5 cpu market will long look long take start offer low end AM4 cpu base Zen release year year initial launch Zen delusional think AMD go suddenly drop big platform pc look amazon well sell cpu list cpu AM4
yeah hate marketplace buy strictly Amazon care extra burn blu ray stuff go buy shit store know authentic
agree have gpu upgrade benefit game start cpu upgrade sure minor start gpu massive jump upgrade cpu nice jump way cpu upgrade minor gpu huge jump meaningful jump round instead small large end result
6900xt disagree cpu upgrade priority
literally upgrade hand smoke youtube crack rot brain
think word read comment
disregard thermal equation see x600x series outperform x800x generation gaming workload well heat dissipation core scheduling choose 5600x 5800x exactly reason despite relatively small price gap
discontinue x399 want Epyc significantly market huge demand middle ground
AM4 board launch begin conversation plus AM4 launch year ago
yep add retooling cost fact mobo literally cost LGA socket current pricing especially include mention post motherboard genuinely cost bit series probably launch cheap
help troubleshoot work frankly care slight good onboard graphic huge time saver
yes realistic kind happen cpu socket manufacture new come replace precedent example AM4 AM3 AM2 AM1 fm2 LGA LGA consumer desktop cpu socket release history humankind proceed AM5 LGA socket sorry loss AM4 platform dearly miss AM4 cpu user upgrade 5800x3d extremely disappointed 5800x3d performance metric well bad fact drop AM4 platform people want upgrade stick dead platform dead old cpu go come AM4 miss say AM5 high end platform AM4 low end share exact statement abundantly clear follow amd release closely thank
GPU bind move 3800xt 5900x immmediately feel difference 5600x talk 5800x3d upgrade GPU case frame pace series well tangible upgrade buck trend unbalanced build low end cpu 3200mhz ram power shit like tend happen case card demanding system manifest thing like stutter especially try squeak power supply upgrade reality want hear probably platform upgrade want particular graphic card lot issue people tendency lean balance cpu simply people wanna discord call multiple browser tab open listne music game use case build cpu helpful road fine old GPU like 60fps title happen upgrade push basically m say people well experience shift mentality bit go peg graphic card saving cpu memory especially ryzen see framerate number bar chart not indication game feel play mentality people go oh not need core game fact s entirely dependent game people discord call watch youtube video multiple tab open gaming yeah actually benefit core instead monitor thread usage time game reality modern game heavily thread game like Warzone example current multiplayer game cyberpunk there e lotta misconception thing ofc listen sexy upgrade memory cpu compare gpu pull benchmark number graph chart favorite techtuber not play game prove wrong cat understand focus build little cpu know
sure locked 60fps game fun people want octane
well boost game utilise thread well thermal
example sense claim AMD drop AM4 opposite reiterate continue support future miss say AM5 high end platform AM4 low end share exact stateman guess go google go convince able Lisa Su come house tell person budge futile
absolutely truth say advocate unbalanced build gaming go cpu overkill upgrade gpu yes cpu provide stability experience share opinion talk background task etc check x8PzbDtdbdE Nd9 OtzzFxs Hardware unboxed explain test core background task end think upgrade fast gpu cpu upgrade pipeline great plan go gpu well starting point
boost thermal limited
dawg convinced schizophrenia reply cause sense reply comment year AM4 cpu check remindme year
lol inevitable HuB link not need watch ve see x200B gaming clip thread usage literally run game modern game use thread code properly fact cpu thing go to use case particular m say go series noticeable gpu bottleneck competitive and or sensitive responsiveness game feel fluid notice
clarify game take advantage additional core poor architecture coding nature game information progressively process IE process x y single core number predictor gaming performance dependent cpu
purely thermal limited power limit hit increase core count usually statistical limit cause probability have potato core high

slow money
wish AMD price XT accordingly steep think suppose originally XT feel proper price XT top
think intend purpose card exist reason 7900xtx look great
like new gen selling tactic honestly unpopular opinion new console good term barely need anymore graphical fidelity anymore gaming pc enthusiast tier thing
yeah push wait 7800XT reconsider option like marketing sell bullshit
xtx 300w tdp standard
7800XT purpose 7900xtx look good value nvidia bonker price people totally lose grasp acceptable AMD exploit
yeah bullshit Nvidia pull 4080s XT call think reason people mad low price card compare new Nvidia card
yep low price consider pricing availability issue wait instead buy XT
size wattage price watt probably
call 7800xt way like Nvidia AMD find new upselling tactic gen AMD low price point Nvidia high price point
7900xt obviously think buck point
sense XT high OC potential give past generation track record pretty sure OC lock limited past extra clock put barely par reference clock 7900xtx
chip suppose XT imo
guess yield good relative XFX sort like vs XT
wait party review segmentation achieve clock pwr limit time
xtx tempting mean case XT
point price tag leave room old RDNA stock sell happen Navi card begin release expect XT drop price
like GB price decent
upsell
yeah wtf situation expensive card well value stop upselling
think relax good rdna3 supply MLID claim December heavily split XT model
GB moment
kinda like xt get xtx
7900XT 7800XT Simple
party number cleanly spread way pan real world
probably go to low supply XT outside launch day like non XT
obvious s go Navi CU 6900xt Cut Navi CU 6800xt x200B Navi CU 7900xtx 7900xt Cut Navi 7900xt x200B sell 7800xt 7900xt markup name look 7900xt get reduction
6800 6800XT certain region pretty impossible buy XT april
call Cinema Popcorn Effect
funny xtx expensive upset
true msrp pricing time reach place outside lot variability example UK retailer XT go XT model xts 6800s xtx popular upwards 1500usd XT model look like good deal
expect XTX obvious card 4080 still need review right well likely xtx power limit 250w
lock OC clock range comically 7900xt share silicon cut yeah stock look like upsell defect die saver plus MCD
honestly excited 7700XT jump well driver XT XT nice
geomean 1 545x 335W 6950xt performance Fyi footnote AMD clarify 300w 7900xtx fast 6900xt
1 5x upgrade probably hold water
feel like RDNA3 emphasis 4k 8k double memory bandwidth xtx RDNA2 notorious fall high resolution guess improvement 1440p impressive
price compare cheap 6950xt product video card c 524 sort price page 1 exactly feel like generational shift value
bet see 4080 pricing perf AMD go to entire market feel like way get reasonably price see jump 6800xt month ago happy
pretty obvious moment XTX performance announce pretty sure RDNA2 offer similar value rdna3 low end stack current discount price apply
like 80CU direct comparison 6900xt interesting comparison architecture perspective hope think Xt CU scratch goona like CU instead
big gap XT 790XT think 7800XT middle fast 6950xt
yes judge ALU count navi32 performance 7900xtx 6950xt graph maybe navi32 clock little bit high navi31 will change
think people forget RDNA go bring RT performance uplift previous architecture similar raster performance price give well rt performance brainer honestly look upgrade reason go 6800xt abysmal rt performance compare nvidia
probably slow xt fast XT render xt joke long
wait holiday season discount little bit desperate rid RDNA2 Ampere stock
man r hardwareswap people sell xt
think company cut price new gen overstock previous gen finally go price temporary sell previous gen lose gen sell price price performance actually go new gen instead absurd especially ridiculous be not covid crypto boom market anymore nvidia amd accept eventually
think 7800XT close 7900xt 7900xt XTX easily fast 6950XT AMD bare minimum 7900xts
know AMD follow nVidia Ampere model have dual function alu FP32 INT32 particular wide batch safe assumption assume XT Navi stream processor total FP32 alu base limited performance information available look like AMD extra FP32 capacity roughly rate nVidia 4k divide number FP32 alu effective shader count hypothetical XT match XT need run 2 6ghz likely fast slow depend actual shader scaling actual clock speed think safe bet pretty close
av1 encoder huge deal want use functionality kinda midrange gen month month away likely
depend 7800xt cut cu navi31 cu navi32 guess curious n31 base card bit bit cu card like fast plus OC headroom hopefully well RT performance look promise
probably wait dump 6950xt cheap snap nice little upgrade 6800xt water block
mean make sense fast 3090ti 7800xt probably cost half
7900xt 7800XT imo rename 7900xtx 7900xt
see 6800xt check amazon everyday 6800xt 670 stock party scalper see 6800xt directly snatch man s steal
yeah sound right match gen high end card come cheap price
N32 CU chip cut N31 compete X070 chip limited quantity like
Best RT performance
mean trend hold equivalent gpu fast gen counterpart surprised XT fast XT
want sell XT
think wait XTXTXXTXTXXXX
finally see post nvidia sell justify amd sell 7900xt insane cost
7900XT call 7800XT sell buck AMD basically pull soft nvidia shofte name price
walk great think
7900xt actually 7800XT price compare 6800xt
pretty close expect course AMD good result expect lead average raster close 2x rt wide suite game
People ignore price jump 6800XT 6900xt amount like gaming performance
egregiously bad option win win
low bar Nvidia present pride greed AMD meet smh
6800xt successore 7900xt tho navi xt die
XTX value comment base fact people assume base RX xtx RTX competitor
look CU perspective 7900xt cu 6900xt technically naming scheme give price appropriate performance raw spec
base flagship equivalent 7900xtx competitive 6090xt trade blow rasterization look untouchable right make look bad naming wise remain see place 7900xtx trade blow rasterization like Ti situation cut silicon ampere doubt AMD flagship price gauging 7900xtx like 6800xt equivalent showcase price gauging honestly way look mess touch gen Value go mid range look like expensive
need cuda core
honestly think price generational spec comparison budget orient buyer mid range buyer enthusiast people good matter imo matter name spec spend performance vs card price point People target budget get bracket fuck name good performance gen 6950XT amazing card probably overkill 4k monitor think completely reasonable gen product new mid tier budget card happen market like iPhone imo anti consumer long lot performance money go case people buy gen card especially hand think great push budget buyer market e g expect brand new greatest late budget orient lot performance money gpu long time wish bit clear naming product launch perform well confusing new card big number fit trend new 7800XT good 6950xt think completely bad consumer price ceiling rise separate problem relative performance
pretty easy away price increase look competition
hey brother open recently close wound fight GPU AMD queue MSRP end get 6800 non XT week
appropriately price paper 7900xt basically 6800xt replacement pretty egregious price increase
favorite card gen power efficient card stock generation
xtx sell one available scalper price people flock xt MSRP
yes pure raster look accurate suspect AMD power hog variant 7950XT slightly exceed raster NVIDIA counter fat die 4090ti actually burn house
probably AIB card will not like
let 7800xt price performance
sadly look way regardless class card gear uneducated buyer wise gamer buy class
make decision easy
think sure card way cheap want crazy margin leave world gpu reasonable thank nvida face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy hopefully people speak wallet social medium post great know people fool increase fun
let hope leak 3ghz clock speed true
remember leak say gen flagship gpu go 3x fast trust leak
loathe generation majority performance increase halo product rest stack middling gain hope normal move forward certainly go help drive adoption ray trace k display performance improvement low mid range card adequate wait
early stuff see 7700xt performance comparison 6900xt 6950xt
XTX brainer upgrade upselling tactic call 7800XT sense
sign clearly state intention price new generation card tier
Xt XT XT
shit nvidia way people bullshit shit nvidia use different die rightfully silent amd shit nvidia xt use different die xt x time unlike xt xt company go to company try squeeze dollar pocket
AMD release dual GCD GPU gen gladly eat word actually happen design see announce couple week ago compete likely beat performance guess lot r d attempt multi gcd package inherent latency issue large uplift raster RT example maybe low framerate awful make basically unusable consumer product course speculation fact lot people expect dual GCD product pretty tell MCM design pan AMD hope gen
60fps great
sad time heel turn know come soon

let card actually cost believe suggest retail price day age
slide presentation raytrace datum great
Inb4 7800XT MSRP
DLSS number count represent real performance

normally agree AMD usually fair number lie manipulate nearly competitor Ryzen promise performance improvement Ryzen review show accurate Ryzen promise performance improvement turn
substantially high usually see non x model think ryzen gap like close Vega think
average lawyer speak configs vary person person
compare consider AMD confirm will compete furthermore nonsense make thing deceptive grain salt wait independent review
hate average fps FPS setting
link remember see xt old datum
catch nvidia raytracing gain get good performance especially enable FSR
agree want RT Nvidia way fairness RT kinda naff worth think
daft number average fps stupid legal disclaimer refer large average fps increase game show
generational uplift scoff pretty darn good especially consider actually cheap previous gen 6950xt GPU actually raw uplift get point raw performance scale gaming performance CPU Game Engine overhead
literally say rasterization title

watch true generation lol
nearly cut GB vs core
lol Whaaaat XD
market speak protect self incase use old cpu get bad fps claim performance figure misleading mean max FPS stupid easy manipulate look ground sky high fps play game normally obviously mean average fps
read footnote account people different hardware good result possibly achieve result achieve setup describe footnote guard complaint people use different setup include driver god know
max fps average fps obvious score 6950xt legal speak sue idiot get 1fps AMD promise

XT bin XTXs fail validation
sure review 2544 nvidia geforce rtx 4090 HardwareUnboxed say High Quality result like 4k RT 83fps 6950xt 49fps
game raytrace work AMD believe FSR change require good performance
sure play pretty intense game style similar cyberpunk Ray trace implementation look good intense like cyberpunk build benchmarke tool game FSR kinda stupid
buy 6900xt right way msrp

right congratulation see include hopium hell drug
maybe XTX sell MSRP available markup
agreed need price drop
true clear cement spec guess maybe bottleneck make xtx perform number game hide
probably mixture upselle high model simply have defective die actually ie upselling make sense
think XT simply non spec xtx die design production start see high yield rate xtx worse value proposition XT upsell and or discourage buy cheap
kinda funny AMD n Nvidia decoy pricing opposite direction
price anchor
7900xt direct successor 69 50 XT core cu 7900xt 6900xt 7900XT sell AMD 7900XTX cheap market AMD water pricing market Nvidia raise look like sell feel like end AMD clearly lower price maybe extent want well RTX 7900xtx sell suppose feel like 7900xt bad credit bit overpriced compare 7900xtx case 7900xtx offer insane value insane price
yes pricing reflective supply AMD cut part relative die part 300mm2 GCD yield able provide adequate supply part price point course business reason price point leave ton room price navi32 silicon base perform Nvidia price competition
blame em past opposite cut card far popular cut card way well value return hurt amd margin business standpoint make little sense cut popular chip especially RDNA2 not produce sell lot 6800s s exist chip not 6800xt story happen
make sad complete idiot buy card hey worry natural selection fool money easily part
cheap well value Vega
bad gb 4070ti
gen usually way spend available low tier well value
yeah like 12fps cyberpunk lot frame viable
similar NVIDIA try GB
pointless able clock close gap
power consumption
yeah problem need big psu XTX require new case ugh
actually 7800xt
exist sell broken die
base math probably end like slow game bad value 7900xtx bad particularly try fit low power budget
think appeal 300w card instead 355W card mean compatible PSUs motherboard people want 6900xt replacement power draw
buy scalper buy crazy high board partner model
card kill 7800xt likely cut launch near performance 7900xt well get 6900xt
need Intel step game lack competition kill normal consumer like know Intel probably
look like good value proposition 450w want space heater
AMD Nvidia tactic soon go NV tactic claim MSRP sell 2080ti style style despite faux msrp translate Euro vat cost
gen come year highly doubt AMD move nm Zen come time split nm chip think go nm doubt multichip GCD go come fruition AMD RDNA multi chip compute tile way complicated multi chip memory tile probably avoid need arrive go multi compute tile present problem hell Nvidia benefit go MCM doubt multi GCD couple generation good especially gaming card
number AMD show RT card great wait thing end xtx cheap interesting far RT performance especially consider rasterisation performance well
bad value usually opposite
yep basically glorified 7800XT try abuse shortage new hardware
800 way steep
RX pretty match console obviously expensive total pc
gaming pc enthusiast tier thing sorta casual gamer please console game pc expensive premium upgrade choose
7900xtx price good level performance compare Nvidia 7900xt cheap actually land cost
actually
funny think matter upset matter opinion
wait XT perform price cautiously optimistic XT vs XT good upgrade guess AMD try NVIDIA beating
nice efficiency increase
driver update probably 1 8x
1440p go cpu bottleneck like
mean launch price 6950xt think fair compare like value price drop dramatically gen card
boat get 6800xt Asrock taichi reasoning plus sell 3060ti cheapo upgrade
yeah know point wait mid range rdna3 card upgrade build new system probably good value year release price drop maybe 50xt refresh model stand perf look like right line outgoing RDNA2 model current pricing
300mm2 die know cut XT go base Navi 60cu accord angstronomic
XT barely fast xt space xt
guess 7800XT par tiny bit ahead 6900xt bump 6950XT way close 7900xt pic price difference 7900xt bad value
base number XT 20 fast xt
RT gimmick accord sub matter raster performance important metric
RTRT important overwhelming majority gamer way bump CU accord AMD claim translate Navi card have well RTRT xt clock speed CU CU give performance hit RTRT effect perceptible difference time 34fps instead 30fps example
power consumption
amd benchmark fast RT capability regardless engineering team say 7900xtx bring fast RT FPS core 6950xt general raster performance RT performance core cu rdna3 chip fast 6950xt RT raster performance likely CU 7800xt fast raster RT Rx xt
probably n32
highly doubt gap 6800XT 6900XT not big
fast watt XT use low power draw generation expect fast overall wait
want sell XT enduser probably want sell unit OEMs XT let bin defective xtx chip level reduce cost xtx increase effective yield
mean gen gpu cost good discount look equivalent 6900xt performance Improvement like xdx improvement 6950xt
mean CU count roughly equivalent give performance improvement 6 900xt xtx give performance Improvement 6950xt technically slot similar bracket cost price usd keep inflation
ideally talk relatively compare price 7900xtx
agree 7900xtx
suck output 4k 120fps
mean fast compare card
yeah high end usually performance increase significantly price smart decision halo product poor value astounding good value perform well 2x price way bad increase XT XT
maybe slight well loss loss high end gaming pretty start right
small pineapple voluntarily brutally ram ass win
exactly person reply say XT rename XT XT msrp
know spec card 6900xt fast game 7900xt successor close 6900xt match Nvidia tier card cost usd real MVP 7900xt GPU weird
eventually company go run minor stepping x700 begin high end x800 flagship x800 x900 x950 come x900 beginning high end flagship time XT XTX honestly series XX Special X Edition flagship
value compare assume number line report
true right big price begin look RTX RX XT pricing great anymore XT bad card
sound right rolling on the floor laughe get XT 7900xtx real 7900xt compete XT aka XT sit Ti GB GB unfortunate AMD rival MSRP GPU 1000 AMD simply up price elegantly community notice
say launch day post sub unfortunately got downvote hell
real reason AMD price 7900xt way likely will yield 7900xtx have 308mm 2 GCD good bin price lower able stock 7800xtx interesting
NVIDIA counter fat die 4090ti actually burn house crank power die fast GDDR6X plenty disabled GPU work time compare Ti situation stick slow G6X give fast module
4090ti will graphic card anymore graphic
Nvidia
guess xt performance
wise gamer buy class say dude know money buy class card big deal buy class card flatter
think class card purchaser iq enlighten folk buy class card maximum frames preferably salvage pc road free infinite value
lmfao
exactly AMD intend
consider 6900xt 6950xt like apart 7700xt go well 6900xt like dollar 6900xt crazy good deal
case use midrange Navi chip XT instead XT XT basically market segmentation upselling
different die issue lol low tier die totally logical 6800xt use N32 long price high hell beat 6950xt performance
nth time legal word cover ass try pair xt mid tier cpu well try replicate number 4k
7800xt match 6950xt mean 6800xt 7800xt get improvement 6950xt find 6900xt
face with head bandage ouch
like raytrace tech blow 4k game 4k probably worth kind number series card
ouch fps die Light native get
wait 7900xt 7900xtx unlaunch
dlss fsr day insane preferably want want use feature especially high end card
need DLSS number compare FSR number
car turbo count real performance displacement matter
game launch feature think unfair generation ago use DLSS FSR performance gain think outlier feature probably compare performance gain go high DirectX universal
lol Wtf fake performance dumb shit hear AMD fanboy wild
deceptive clearly state performance rasterization max setting RT performance Max setting
RT max setting treat seperate thing review completely fair
RT new psycho set likely
raw FSR FSR mention like RT slide
FSR slide confirm perf basically level RTX Ti game gain maybe large cyberpunk truly Ada Lovelace
disappointing budget offering bad value premium guess light year well value nvidia right
stop say indicate overall average mean maximum ideal condition correct
know AMD claim compete number post take grain salt AMD late history datum comparison accurate idk feel definitely area
give result fairly easy determine 7900xtx result max fps average accord TechPowerup 6950XT get following k v 133fps Cyberpunk 38fps Watchdogs Legion 64fps reckon AMD show average peak fps fair bit high game 6950xt
performance relate set
oh right lmao dunno completely forget XT
yeah buy card place
excuse Intel Arc dgpu comparable RT RTX series
performance gain RT AI compare series Nvidia cards poor advancement Raster time price buy card effectively available time little gain chiplet approach raise price disappointing
sorry let fool copium mean good result ideal circumstance average mean average phrase meet display average label average see people parrot mean average cya lawyer speak post proof claim
Max Settings slide
average FPS average fps sue see performance metric idiotic need cover ass case
repeat lawyer CYA language give support evidence usage mainstream usage phrase mean ideal situation fall significantly want responsible mean absolute good average mean expect majority usage time conflate
say poor grammar probably charge publish
sorry number average label average 70fps time edge case 92fps go 92fps average d average Idk mean average cya lawyer speak shtick come see shred evidence

oh cool feature lock Nvidia anymore
FSR kinda stupid FSR exist game come time FSR come Ubisoft stop release big update game
Nitro 1k euro order germany Red Devil 1k too mindfactory not Nitro
practically give point
yes XT
support markup wait year gpu
know card need dollar price drop
agreed need price drop 100
sure 4070ti hit basically undercut price outperform average
need price drop 7900xtx performance expect interesting 7800xt performance 7900xt low
need discount sell blink eye
yeah make sense point keep yield high able produce relatively high proportion die sku
r AMD Nvidia upsell bad AMD upsell find way construe good thing
go cheap end situation like Ryzen sell good core die disable core cover demand
make perfect sense hold price drop reserve Nvidia inevitably make counter
matter card good value reason matter like good yield Zen3 justify crank 6C segment pricing People willing come kind rationalization preferred brand parasocial relationship thing think factually supportable different brand NVIDIA people scream price decoy way matter matter provide good value market 7900XT fair Mr cost go fast people realize general 7900xt obviously case true specific reason sku raise normal big sku offer well value cutdown obviously problematic bit think people generally discount AMD afraid miner stockpile NVIDIA afraid NVIDIA series stockpile right price definite competitor 7900XT NVIDIA miner ultimately price AMD gain cut throat pricing want price high let series inventory burn NVIDIA pull Navi launch big chip original plan midrange card AMD change month ago go big chip wait series miner card sell NVIDIA honestly scared expect kinda figure launch soon push little hard 7900xt pricing problem push Navi plus high price cutdown look like avoid put price pressure legacy market like NVIDIA reason Miner inventory NVIDIA inventory reason sure slow walk NVIDIA original plan Navi chip suppose come
XT die XTX
imagine confident TSMC produce high yield XTX package design resilient cache offload large process chiplet main die process s purpose TSMC probably institutional knowledge crank node pretty good yield Navi big pretty small
mean literally defect die 7900xt demand artificial cut good die raise price good way adjust demand available supply defect die
eh think upsell shape well value despite expensive likewise 7900xtx seemingly well value 7900xt case hardware small card cut bit compare reduction price
yes make money like
fps base whoppin frame measly increase price Hilarious
stop fuck cope will not hit 3ghz bullshit card near limit
turn Power target measly 55w
confuse average power draw transient power spike issue high end RTX card 450w RTX connector melt run fine 850w psu hope AMD card reintroduce issue fix Nvidia
option depend supply see card sell listed MSRP account small percentage available supply mean majority people end have buy expensive partner model buy reference card scalper
7900XT 7800xt ideally 7800XT barely fast 6950xt make sense
7900xtx card replace 6800xt cheap mean super obvious 7900xt replace 6800xt Nvidia way bad increase price bere worse pardon amd
compare AMD AMD Nvidia nvidia
look like reason 7900xt exist use die cut XTX
absolutely true thing change time 5800X head scratcher launch accept literally
AMD remain consistent pricing Nvidia go rail
450w want space heater run genuinely cost pretty penny esp Europe country electricity price reach 0 8 kwh
power limit 300w lose performance game
actually use game voltage limited weirdly high tgp reason
sure pricewise show well performer price pay compare like 7900xtx look well value money vs 7900xt like low segment overprice tier look like good value absurd cost digit fricke insane like oh wow cheap stupid expensive like say 7900xt high msrp 6800xt
limit watt performance 150w limit perform 350W
lmfao MSRP guarantee FE model pricing translate number different economy IE usd Euro
pretty company release consumer electronic month high price currency tank far Nvidia issue
go NV tactic claim MSRP sell AMD AIB charge RX 6900XT PowerColor Liquid Devil special edition Microcenter Microcenter scalp
Nvidia benefit MCM
Nvidia benefit go MCM try alas multiple year technology sure make good job monolithic die time consistently make 600mm2 die associated low yield physical limit big die get unwieldy manufacture implement
usually opposite live new era bang buck long low midrange
chance AMD change heart reduce price 7900xt
think like realize uncompetitive Nvidia value dollar utterly curb stomp Nvidia offering reheat leftover
yes expensive short run long run cost efficient let pay pc self decent spec yes double cost console spec hold let year s not play 4k fps 1080p play old gpu run 1440p new console year console gamer upgrade new console game old play year spend console spend pc upgrade want save like xtx cost console future proof pc long time edit misconception console release year sorry guy bad deal console pc believe well option end day
Nope Xbox GPU 6700xt
Steam Deck 4k gaming the tool deck provide hard run pretty smoothly plex server workstation monster beast

4k pretty damn like 30xx 6xxx series 4k high fps people need home computer anymore stuff computer browse web watch video send email phone handful power user actually use computer job benefit have gaming computer console plus laptop job school etc
like support AMD like year old common let honest price good comparison shit Nvidias pull raise msrp 6900 6950xt year scalper XT XTX like good deal similar tactic Nvidia employ decent deal tho
important

RT gimmick sense PhysX hairwork effect nvidia title implementation devs game lack surface unnecessarily turn mirror instead accurately reflect environment store glass window water road turn dead accurate mirror reflect real life slight ask worth halve performance accurate shadow position reflective surface performance hold acceptable level sure turn feature

distract Nvidias gpu
weird comparison fixate code instead actual generation performance improvement know naming mean gb performance increase vs ti come price tag amd price tag 7900xtx improvement 6950xt amd up price literally Nvidia try brute force justify price tag gpu mess people sense value 7900xtx probably beat raster chart real

possible
FPS die Light native stop DLSS lie frame rate bro DLSS enable speed die Light benchmark find
like
gpu talk
foolish use DLSS FSR high resolution waste performance render native 3840x2160 pixel upscale look good high resolution choose natively render 4k DLSS FSR
FSR DLSS upscaling hugely important hit 144hz 240hz frame cap high end card resolve well native upscale 1440p 4k like compare card performance useful make purchasing decision specific card commenter call dlss3 0 specifically use frame interpolation belong near benchmark upscaling thing insert fake frame fps number useless Nvidia insert fake frame real frame triple FPS count meaningless awful play
not know not FSR2 DLSS incredibly useful select game run 4k 5k ultrawide dumb use
Fsr come year dlss currently release frame generation separate setting dlss test dlss frame generation fyi
oh frame high input lag artifact maybe day today
bad analogy make sense close record car play twice speed look like run track fast
hallucinate frame respond user input hallucination real run
FSR slide mention FSR raytracing slide RASTERIZATION mention FSR
surprising intel show arc gpu long amd invest ray trace dedicated core like nvidia nvidia ray tracing embarrassing intel attempt dgpu well raytracing amd Amd need invest dedicated ray trace core asap
clearly say rasterization
ya hope cut navi31 announce like Nvidia go deep end pricing amd choose announce lower price card batch reason consider 7900xtx right buy generation want wait navi32 base card want wait consider xt buy xtx price perf well
4k max setting mentally challenge mean game
worth
raytracing actual thing people use fast card money plus support shitty company shitty moral bad business practice
max setting raster
honestly RT dosnt want buy Nvidia card personal rig thing consider Nvidia price AMD deliver money
seperate graph ray trace show suppose satisfied
wrong cya language sue person succeed want deal Intel nVidia AMD sector use language
phrase mean ideal situation fall significantly want responsible world lawyer language
straight wrong Coping legal cya language Intel nVidia AMD everyfucke fact come post show person cope grow fuck
hey op post remove compliance Rule civil follow wide rule mean insult personal attack slur brigade mass mention user rude behaviour discuss politic religion allow r AMD read r Amd rules message mod clarification
say minute think look make comment
prove average compare 6950xt number 6950xt party review close confirm amd number avg simple
oh lo notice XD
fucking kid goddamn common knowledge goddamn tinfoil hat stop obnoxious fuck see person excuse bear yesterday literally hear disclaimer decade downvote idiot
infer past AMD presentation individual game benchmark plus max fps sense game 3x spike FPS split
amd 6950xt number line party 6950xt avg fps avg fps shut
Microsoft sure DXR
real shame beautiful game benefit FSR sure like cyberpunk
mean new GPU fulfill need
know feel bro forever
hopefully wait year like gen
day buy u nasa quality gpu
gt730
remind time get hd GHz
be happen day get high end GPU long go pay Ati Radeon Pro launch like life time ago
card unlaunched
TI XT fast
performance 7900xtx expect people expect killer think unrealistic XT XTX release probably sit 4090ti
value proposition well reason nVidia use totally different chip instead cut one explanation hold
Nvidia care AMD lol
mean constrain production capacity normally seek fill high margin sku lately high expect yield wafer encourage semi conductor maker price product encourage high margin sku
mind r amd hate thing Nvidia love exact thing instead AMD kind like ray trace obvious useless gimmick long Nvidia well switch promising technology future situation AMD match Nvidia
buck cry
yield crank zen3 price wafer supply demand street price 5600x like month set low MSRP change chip
say
yield high position 7900XT value proposition upsell 7900xtx think look price change sign success strategy
7900xtx 7900xt launch 6900xt fine 7900xt 7800XT launch instead like 6800xt pretty big jump surprised drop price later want interfere remain series stock
yea case 7900xtx 7900xt well model dollar expensive reasonable upsell compare dollar price difference AMD plan bait switch launch revise pricing downwards hope
3ghz let know mention need smoke cig dick ass thing rnda kinda need 5700xt bio able overclock non xt near xt performance
eh mention power spike point confuse talk Nvidia card matter compare XT XT xtx power consumption modern PSUs handle spike AMD small power spike relevant comment realistically system Ryzen 5600x 5800x3d 6900XT 600W 650W psu extra 55w push limit
good point make wonder actual XT go look like suspect leak say Navi chip mcd actually XT instead XT like leak say
try offload 6900 6950xt reasonable price
time difference minimum vram bandwith vs XT get shader
maybe AMD introduce non XT XTX regular XT introduce xtx XT 7900xt needlessly muddy water performance tier
think cu good deal inflation ludicrous
7800XT like time
7800xt AMD straight 7700XT slightly beat 6800x probably well marketing
think company believe make X800 chip slightly cut die mistake XT probably go to big jump xtx XT probably expect
eh XT XT replacement call 79xx 78xx replacement
tbh 7900xt stick weird place AMD price encroach theoretical price 7800xt suppose mainstream card card bad value obvious solution rename 7900xt 7800xt lower price dollar range go happen
remind AMD GPU RDNA consistent ass
0 45kw kwh year half price stupid card electricity cost rate
dude stop act like helpless bystander game hour day set aggressive standby power profile afterburner leave
actually reduction power crazy efficent

uncompetitive Nvidia outsell AMD gpu like 10 1
upgrade console year release game PS4 year old console game release till Nov guarantee run launch PS4 time year old console clearly own console console gamer upgrade new console game old play
Idk literally need pc work study invest marginal upgrade add gaming GPU vs buy entirely new system console work pc
current console not 4k60 case cheat resolution scaling
console gpu right 2070S level Idk stack amd discrete
game upscale 1440p refresh old gen game new game will different lock fps time
disagree think price 7900xtx low expect
hardware acceleration break nvidia
go slow sure cpu bottleneck 1080p 1440p look number provide close 4k obviously go bottleneck low resolution go fast cache hit
hmm misunderstood 700xtx big upgrade wager like 5x performance 980ti
new FSR work old card NVidia card point Navi serie high end mobile solution Navi budget
lineup change like AMD naming consistent decade CU GPU clock close 3ghz close xt performance
6900xt fast 6800xt expensive
laugh time hairwork mention remember people freak say big thing photo realism big stink absolute rubbish frankly RT launch
personally speak not buy current card RT like DX10 time game feature card available well RT way future RT game go murder current card RT largely pointless
tack gimmick shit RT performance
good use game look good tends come big performance hit great replace old fake reflection technique RT give nice quality boost pretty want RT reflection game artifact old technique annoying highly perceptible Global Illumination RT nice tend subtle hit performance
yup subreddit technology matter AMD make AMD well anytne construe gimmick useless look people shit job need CUDA inevitably tell CUDA useless people matter person need
big scam history lmao dude hear Bernie Madoff apparently
RTRT claim fast CU CU RTRT performance expect fast clock speed RTRT result show range fast low end fast high end FSR add upscaling range cyberpunk particular show fast RTRT fast RTRT fast RTRT FSR

m talk displayport not support framerate high 4k screen card not matter cable bottleneck
wrong
nvidia want sell gpu gamer need start invest help increase gpu demand like vr becasue point buy display 4k compromise framerate worth 144hz reason upgrade gen sku
6900xt performance wattage sound good world
enjoy getting rape greedy corp buy card greedy corps anyways make bold statement bud example burger maybe buy class card nearly educate think

way actually card begrudgingly buy cough extra oppose people persuade
mb right let check native
yeah wrong number head
choose natively render 4k DLSS FSR think weird upscale run natively upscaling look bad native
Dlss2 maybe glitching dlss3 fuck pay shit
native look well
improve game care benchmark want real performance cheaty frame
post sound like GPU xD fuck use FSR DLSS comment sound hear people gpu dare use FSR DLSS ruin gaming experience high tier GPU experience bad wtf
interpolate frame wtf say lol
yes talk rasterization perf talk DXR Raster surprising op talk RT level raster 70ish fps DXR defense naturally assume op talk DXR uplift
comment show know absolutely chip design Intel new market complete clean slate chip design significant advantage right AMD incremental improvement exist design will clean slate design replacement RDNA entirely vs vs
RTX Ti level DXR welcome actually bit underwhelming vs Ada gen gen AMD play catch rdna4 plan PoR not change stage AMD react maybe rdna5
Amd need invest dedicated ray trace core asap thank prefer cheap card good raster
yeah trap
explain exactly setting mean way read exactly define say qualify result comparison like clear breakdown mentally enable
yeah spec write
max setting
AMD deliver RT performance par Nvidia
moron want wear tinfoil hat
infer card come
r9 290x rest forever month 6800xt buuttttttttttt
cryptocurrency anf recession go right Doubt thing thing year m pray statement sour milk tho rolling on the floor laughe
get away meddle Nvidias ti
remember GeForce Ultra come whopping US uproar intense
gt730 slow modern integrate gpu go increase electricity bill yeah pretty worthless point
buy r9 fury today need spend like fucking match
know new price imagine AMD adjust accordingly
RTX 4070ti generally performance close RTX performance level
clearly XT release Nvidia drop price RTX think GTX
cry dude exaggerate shit vote
design reply confusing talk XT XTX like different chip production start see high yield rate XTX AMD sell XTX rest gets label XT fuse exact chip
term value upsell well 7900xtx base msrp shader count upsell GPU 7900xtx upsell GPU value equation change account fire insurance
realistically system Ryzen 5600x 5800x3d 6900XT 600W 650W psu extra 55w push limit realistic scenario drop grand graphic card
Series Series
hopefully beat GT expect letter
look core count max core count die obviously 6900xt 6800xt replacement
not exactly pretty different performance tier
high end year RDNA2 focus low end mid range option course expensive edit exclude Vega Radeon high end
355kw kwh year honestly entire year worth difference dollar go sway worried dollar energy entire year buy CARDS
go game hour week blast AAA game worth play atm face with tears of joy
hour gaming max power usage week kid go school free time let kid game hour day weekend bad parent game 450w nonstop benchmarke reach number 4k anti aliasing like 300w typical lot use vsync totally overblown problem
irony post r AMD skullskullskullskull Vega
benchmark usually stock get to push number raptor lake zen4 max need proper pre tuned ram obscene cost ppl omgawd fast normal ram ddr5 xmp timing suck lot ppl tune ram
reason amd make cpus hot mess box marketability
enthusiast GPU seriously ask tweak GPU offer 600w ball wall performance option make sense tweak efficient want Nvidia lock like Apple way highway
god phorbid suggest company product benefit user general zombifie goblin subreddit especially 1500 msrp product
care power draw
efficient overclocke box
tweak pull slider slightly left people power limit undervolt gpu
Debauer confirm tho
hope correct people jump buy get worried personally consider upgrade generation value proposition tenable maybe price come bit year reevaluate
Nvidia outproduce AMD
Dsame lile pc aiming stick not like go gaming pc able play 4k watch film payment research write word play music sure 2k lot foe ppl tje hand midrange phone atleast year instead buy new iphone year 1 5k understand ppl loke pay fine 5 year xbox ps5 4 tbh price go way fast pc gaming stop overpay thing like cpus gpu think need xd will not
work like compare amd arch nivida arch say 6700xt
smoke crack
yep think microsoft GPU manufacturer try fix
okay clearly understand say Nvidia GPU tax cpu hard AMD GPU cause Nvidia GPU cpu bottleneck low fps AMD GPU source
budget use case x 1440p gaming 6800xt video card make lot sense video card nearly double cost performance number real world match AMD claim availability AIB price scalper price real possibility consider
bit sad Hairworks catch tbh cuz look pretty dope despite huge performance hit
valid point people need Nvidia rest relevant feature
fast high end link benchmark good result see claim rounded number likely like like number round look like increase FSR know gap FSR imagine small new gpu like 2 7x fast FSR extra compute lot attribute FSR improvement EDIT fast RT FSR enable odd chart
high end look steam gpu survey run performance card 3080 6900xt high end new king 3080ti 3090ti group 6800xt 6900xt 6950xt group
yeah example know instance specific game push performance forward understand say slippery slope problem raw GPU power measure high end inherent limitation ceiling Nvidia release enthusiast dual chip 1000w GPU tomorrow double performance 4 5k logic apply mid upper midrange card decade half high end gaming define gaming experience provide card available range inflation give current console performance think 4k 60 high end gaming target enthusiast card punch bit Nvidia AMD want release enthusiast card 1600 2500 fine dandy allow drag entire pc gaming market throw definition performance realize high margin relate note exactly suddenly pc gaming market starve budget orient card control halo product redefine performance segment pull pricing floor
high end tier enthusiast XT RTX especially bad compare miss guy point contradict say name irrelevant high end gaming determine fact buy expensive GPU market define meet relevant performance criterion come gaming basically determine resolution refresh rate latency linear infinite high end hard ceiling human eye pixel Hz untill make difference 8k exclusively high end gaming logic 4k game inch monitor 1440p 165hz pretty hard cap human eye ability distinguish difference point get card run game 600fps vs 240fps result high end gaming
example burger saw smoothbrain exact analogy r nvidia comment yrhcyd ivvehvv day ago know convo waste time absolutely desperate portray low budget moral decision reason

yup energy cost enjoy computer room multiple degree high rest home fact make computer noisy dump extra heat drive nuts TBH want exceed 300w GPU ideally 250w
foot away inch 4k tv upscaling look native native worth imo
1440p monitor right DLSS FSR low resolution like comparable upscaling 4k DLSS Quality look well native 4k wonke TAA DLSS Balanced look display viewing distance result vary course
Cheaty frame fsr3 dlss3 fsr2 dlss2 upscaling know nvidia call frame generation dlss3 amd copy stupid naming scheme god know
fuck use FSR DLSS head pleasure play game actually good F1 game Blurry ghosty mess car leave trail exaggeration Assetto Corsa Competizione CoD Blurry af enemy
wish creative dialogue know look flair GPU play 1440p turn long GPU handle game high fps say preferably want end good result screen right
lol yeah understand chest beat native resolution literally difference DLSS Quality native go FSR thing notice high frame rate brainer case people obsess native literally choose poor performance grandstand upscaling
eyeball screen low image quality reduction performance
fuck use FSR DLSS people fuck image quality
see like will use add lag shooter bad time upscaling fine frame generation
AI generate frame interpolation hallucination professional term AI feed information spit image yes hallucination
ah understand come yeah make sense
yup come sense month go sale party benchmark release super leap consider want step tier card consider price range recent inflation inflation adjust range normally skip generation card buy gen normal generally fine skip generation try talk fast want spend it ignore inflation reality game play past year want upgrade need fps right moment play make want upgrade right play satisfactory stupid large build lately framerate drop get large build active fps stupid large build active make want upgrade spike fps certainly satisfactory
exactly define say setting max definitely leave unnessecarily hard hit setting qualify result comparison game obviously use setting high number well run completely maxe setting game
okay max setting Glad page
purposely insert criterion order prove point issue sure want people single fuck rt Nvidia think worth premium right AMD deliver performance actually well area matter
infer AMD typically show performance datum average upto graph
cheap Rx basic 1080p gaming wait January February buy market surely move 7900xtx XT launch
Titan card start crap
remember gtx gts ultra debacle deserve iirc good close justify price creep today thing
serve purpose give computer video output
similar situation AMD need spend north match Vega north go Nvidia upgrade sense RX 6700XT RX expensive performance upgrade
man brutal go Amazon year maybe year
eh depend game rest PC XT match fury certainly 300 certainly case Fury end slightly fast GCN3 aged poorly NimeZ driver DX12 Vulkan AMD bad uArch HD cripple vram expensive late vs GTX
