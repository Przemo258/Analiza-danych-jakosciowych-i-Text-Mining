Nvidia reached out to OP utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 This is added to Megathread If there is any notable information within this post please tag me so I can add them into the Megathread Thank you
Gamers Nexus would like to know your location
Hope NVIDIA and its AIB are ready to honor their warranty for stuff like this for next 3 5 years s
You aren't the only one This happened to me today as well not as badly burned as your though I was having a gaming session few hours ago playing Black Desert with my dungeon party All the sudden the screen went black and all the fans started spinning at 100 Powered off the machine and after some inspection noticed that the power adapter was damaged My card is Asus RTX 4090 TUF Gaming OC Edition x200B
Maybe you plugged in out 31 times
ULTIMATE POWER DRAW itty bitty living space
once you got your replacement card reach out to us and we will send you a free PCIE cable to help you out a little bit
This shitty squid cable is gonna be such a problem Its practically impossible not to bend it in some way or form I have a massive case I still have to bend it so it doesn t stick straight out I ll never understand why they made it so goddamn short I m really hoping cable mod gets their versions out quickly I imagine they re swamped with orders for both the cable and 90 connector Hopefully the PSU manufacturers can ramp up as well Be Quiet Has their cable out but I ll be damned if I can find where to buy it Gonna contact their CS today
I love that this is now top in hot posts
I dont know why it happened I think my adapter cable is faulty Welp i guess RMA it is EDIT Card was attached vertically Bend was not that aggressive Sure there was bend still this should not happen on a 2k Euro gpu PSU Corsair rmx 1000
I've been hugging my 3080 a lot lately winking face
RTX 5090 will come with a house insurance policy
On this week's episode of Gamers Nexus
I guess that's the risk
this is what happens when you design shit connectors with very little margin of error It is a non issue if they just keep the legacy triple 8 pins combine with PCIE power it has the combined power of 525w more than enough to fill the 450w 4090 Why even bother to fix a non issue
It was really too hard to make a 90 connector And maybe you know NOT engineering a smaller connector for bigger power loads Fucking hell
Hey u reggie gakil I just sent you a direct message Please take a look thank you
What's the point of cables if you're not allowed to bend them Might as well just fucking hardwire the GPU to the PSU at this point
Aparently Nvidia reached out to op according to a mod But what did the nvidia representative say
EVGA wise
Daaaaaamn Seen the cable bent over much worse than this in the SFF subreddit Hope the cable strain wasn't the cause or there's going to be ALOT more instances of this happening
And so it begins
If it's a MSI Jokes aside I hope the OP can resolve this situation as soon as possible
The least nvidia could do is send out rigid 90 degree adapters
Why the fuck don't they provide an 90 degree adapter you put between the cable and GPU
I got one 4090 from MSI i just bent one time the adapter like JayZ demonstrated in a previous video After that i followed the rule of the 30 cycles and so far so good The connector does not touch the panel side except on the middle My opinion is to wait and see if more cases appear If so that is a major problem If not perhaps faulty cable x200B EDIT to provide some context ignore the dust x200B
It all just works man
It has
Damn MSI afterburner really living up to its name
Thanks for being an early adopter
Thank god they're not that s
This sucks but should be covered by a warranty I imagine you used the adapter that came with the card so no reason it shouldn t be covered with normal use But still a headache
The fragility of the connector is really dumb I understand wanting to have more space on the PCB but why didn't PCIE SIG not make the pins the SAME SIZE as the previous PCIe cables thicker robust and just key them differently so they didn't get put into the wrong ports I am beyond careful with that stupid plug because I fear for stuff like this Cablemod's right angle connector cannot come soon enough
It all just works
You would think for the kind of money NVIDIA is asking for its flagship that it would be bulletproof
I remember seeing Steve from GN explaining that they found excessive bending could cause this In your photos the bend doesn't look too bad but who knows I have my 4090 installed traditionally in my 5000x and the lower part of the ATX 3 0 cable going back to the PSU is pushing against the glass not the actual connector I will definitely be keeping an eye on my setup as I have the MEG Ai1000P PCIE5 and the MSI Gaming Trio 4090 which in theory should be the most compatible setup for these cards that you can buy at this time
Defects will happen with any product of course but man I ve always hated the idea of using adapters on parts drawing this much power I hope incidents like this don t start popping up
Fun times ahead for 4090 owners
Might have made better business sense for a right angle connector to ship with these units to prevent this given the cards are colossal and space is limited All fun high FPS games until you have to RMA a unit or someone potentially loses their life due to fire It would be reasonably practicable for Nvidia AIB partners to offer the RA connector for free before this gets out of hand
this is how houses burn down
God I love the smell of early adopter in the morning Smells like free troubleshooting
This is why considering wire pin gauge insulation thickness and style and performing high potential tests that simulate a short term overload on cables is important as a manufacturer It doesn't seem they thoroughly considered the consequences of putting more and more current through connectors like this they're going to get ridiculously hot Most computers do not have perfect cooling and these may not have been designed with heat soaking taken into consideration Edit fixed terminology
Nvidia should team up with Samsung I think they would give us some fire products
lol I'll bet you Nvidia is asking OP to remove the post in exchange for a paycheck or something
There are no fucking excuses For a card that costs 2 000 the connector should be deep space mining grade Of any other material except crappy plastic Please guys stop justifying crappy business practices that only hurt the consumer and encourage future graphics cards to be even more expensive with worse materials I wish you good luck with the RMA process Edit changed military grade
IT FINALLY HAPPENED Real sorry to hear about it though My condolences to your fresh 4090 A JaysTwoCents did a video about these new connectors and how they have a very limited life span when it comes to plugging and unplugging He also mentioned that they weren't as robust because of the size of the connector It's worth mentioning that Nvidia themselves were aware of the issues with these smaller and higher voltage connectors How they justify it escapes me Hopefully you can rma it Best of luck to you
ActualHardcoreOverclocking did a video on this It's rather informative
Really bad What was you doing Playing a game
Its burnt at the pins so I am guessing either bad mount or defective connector
Youtube tech channels starving for content be salivating looking at this thread
Imagine paying 1600 just to see its adapter burn skull
Saw a Google interest link Hmmm ok I'll look at that later Opened up Reddit first thing I see Ooof guess I'll see what this is about I'm sure Gamer Jesus will have a sermon about this
Bad connection with high amps melted plastic
Why they Nvidia cant put the connector in a not shitty spot Ill never know
Now I am thinking about adding 2 thermal sensors around the 12VHPWR connector with a Buzzer
No one 31st Plug in firefirefire
I m really glad I didn t jump in from the beginning I mean no offense to those who did but I d rather spend my free time gaming than diagnosing
They tried to shit on tech jesus got calling out this exact same risk 600W to the card on occasion over 4 6 pins hot damn literally
Oof just waiting for Gamers Nexus to get wind of this one
How much w had you unlocked 450w 600 Can you tell how much draw you had approximately when the problem occurred
skull
Can't just a myth s
Inb4 gamers nexus
Gonna need fire retardant cases for these cards
Just solder the wires to the card
Oh gawd I'll stick bit longer with my rtx 3080 then
What model card and PSU
I had the same problem living in Belgium my RTX 4090 Gaming Oc has died because of the 12pin already sent it back by chance my power supply Seasonic Titanium 1000W is fine NVIDIA need to use better cable with lower AWG like AWG 12 The adapter is also not good enough this is wrong for a product who cost 2000 x200B It's very serious in the worst case it can cause a fire at best it will kill your GPU the adapter and maybe even the power supply
Didn't Jayz2Centz warn about this
If the cable are not meant to be bented they really should make a hard L shape plastics to 'pre bent' it
I'm not an electrical engineer but plugging 4x 8 pin into a thinner gauge smaller plug is just asking for a plastic BBQ
This is about to blow up and get a whole lot more interesting Especially now Jay has highlighted it on his channel I smell a recall or at the very least nvidia shipping out 90 degree Adapters for free Similar to how Apple had to send those silicone band phone cases out to customers for free on the iPhone 4 because we were holding it wrong
The quality lmao
musical notes It s gettin hot in here musical notes
Bravo just bravo No I can't sleep well anymore This might be a risk here now
I'll keep my 3080 a little longer
Queue NVIDIA's Apple moment You're bending it wrong x200B My dad used to say bad engineers blame their customers
Imagine spending almost 2k for a card then another 2k for the rest part of pc then this now i imagine evga left this greedy nvidia anyway
Nvidia don't be a fucking pussy let us plug the 3 prong cable from power supply directly into the 4090
Jensen about to call a hit on OP
Damn I'm really sorry that this has happened to you Can you please tell us the conditions that your card was setup Was the 8 pin to 16 pin adapter under any kind of physical strain I think NVIDIA found something similar happening when the cables were bent a bit too much The more information you can provide us the better it'll help to prevent this issue from happening again for other people
450 watts too much for that little plug Imagine that
Cablemod gonna make an easy 1000000 next week with that 90 degree adapter
RTX 4090 Firestarter LHR Large Hazard Risk fire
Scary Did you have a bend on it I have a pretty server bend on
What AIB I plugged mine into my gbyte gaming but I really don t think I can unplug it It s there permanently now
This looks like the female connector broke down between pins 1 2 and 5 6
Def feel like an oversight by Nvidia as the size of this card is forcing people to bend and jam the cable in most pc cases They shoud ve included a 90 180 degree cable
I think i am going to sticking with my Asus Strix 3090
The RTX 4090 doesn t adapt
I'm happy with my 4090 MSI Gaming Treo at 1st I was bummed it's not an overclock card but now I'm happy it only has 3 8 pins like my 3090ti Where are the pictures of the installed card before the fire Not blaming the card owner however makes you wonder about other parts like the power supply quality and how tight sharp the cable was strung
Hope the RMA is smooth sailing lame issue but it is a new
Why are they insisting one using one connector instead of splitting into say 2 cables and spreading the current load and bending moment of the cables as with previous generation cards When looking at the cable braiding it almost comes across like it's multiple grouped anyways Medium pcb with large heat sink
The need to make these cables with the connector at 90 degrees so people don't need to make a near 180 degree bend
So what is the best way to avoid this
I knew this was going to happen Ask anyone that repairs coin operated arcade games back in the day Burnt connectors was the top problem with them Manufactures tried to run 10 amps or more current though one pin While it is rated for that it generates a lot of heat that will burn it over time as the connection get worse and worse over time leading to full failure like the OP pic
Time for Gamers Nexus
You guys are affording 4090s
I get the feeling we're going to see a lot of this happening
This definitely won t be the last time we see this Up to 500W through those tiny pins is just begging for heat If it s not fully seated or the bend radius is too tight it s damn near inevitable that something like this happens
Thank yall beta testers and it's warranty time for you my friend
There were some articles before 40 series release saying the connectors weren't reliable and would probably burn so I guess we're now seeing it This was strictly with adapters so those with atx 3 0 pins should be fine
Let's design the smallest connector for a literal fucking brick of a card
T W O T H O U S A N D D O L L A R S
Thanks for being an alpha tester I m usually an early adopter but definitely waiting a bit now like I have a choice with scalpers
There's nothing to worry or panic about it all just works man Brandon Bell Nvidia senior technical marketing manager
Is the GPU ok
It is there any RTX4090 without 12VHPWR connector
This is a problem with the connection of the pins and connector If it was a high current issue then both connectors end would melt and also the insulation on the wires would have melted too
Imagine it went worst not only gpu but psu mobo I
You didn't have it plugged in all the way and or bent it too much as well
Was just a matter of now we have connector gate with Ada Nvidia must have hired German engineers
I m getting the CableMod 90 cable once that releases
From my expertise of burning out connectors the fault here is likely factory pins were manufactured with incorrect opening diameter All pins are evenly burned indicating poor connection between pins and receptables Wire bending causes a bending force on the connector improving contacts inside the connector however can cause breakages in the wire to receptible link which would create burns towards the middle of connector
Maybe Jay was
The burnt Nvidia cable is so symbolic of the company
Yea never really understood increasing the wattage while also reducing the amount of wire used to deliver it
It's almost as if there shouldn't be so much fucking power put through one measly little connector
Jayz2cents grinning ear to ear
Looks like this is getting more attention out there v kRkjUtH4nIE
Moore's law and your 1699 month old gpu are dead Fun times
The way it's meant to be played
Was it the 4 PCIe to 12 pin adapter or the 3 PCIe to 12 pin My MSI 4090 is a 3 pin adapter without the NVIDIA branding
Damn that sucks but at least the rest of us now know not to bend these cables even slightly Hopefully you can get it fixed ASAP
what material is that made of
Snap Just when I'd finally decided the time had come to rebuild a shiny new post covid gaming 3d rendering machine Hate to get back on the fence for another year while this gets sorted out but there's no way I'm buying into tech that might just burn your house down
Is this the adapter for connecting to the non ATX3 0 PSUs Or does this issue exist with the 12V connector for ATX3 0 PSU as well
That card is out of commission now Shame
in b4 someones house burns down due to terrible engineering wtf was nvidia thinking just re release the 4090 series now with 4x 8pin instead of this unsafe monstrosity there is no way this new power connector survives past this generation anyway you fucked up nvidia
For those of you who don't know Gamers Nexus was able to replicate and prove that melting cables was much more likely to be caused by bends to close to the connection or the cable not being plugged in all the way to the GPU At the time of writing there have been no cases of melting RTX 4080s and the launch was 4 days ago some people that got them from physical stores have stated using them with no reported issues however remember that the percentage of failure on the RTX 4090 is said to be 0 1 to 0 05 The majority of RTX 4080s were bought online and most people should have theirs by this week Then we will see if the RTX 4080s also have a low but relevant chance of melting
Well I guess Tech Jesus and Jay 2cents were on to something and the whole it was fixed assurances were bs Edit As of 30 mins ago you are now on Jays2cents
what is even more problematic is this user have the GPU vertical mounted where the cable seems to have least amount of stress and still got burnt out
I was already surprised when I was making custom cables for my 3090 The pins and wires are sooooo tiny fragile and fiddly I wouldn't even dare dis connecting a couple of times or wiggling the cable without redoing the whole thing for just some peace of mind At this point they should start making on board power supplies so you can just plug in your mains power cord directly to the gpu Heck the pcbs are so tiny they only take up half the length of the cooler anyways
at this point just plug it into a wall socket like the microwave
But but that hecking engineer on gamernexus said all is fine Oh i guess it s not
What's even stupider is this stupid cable didn't even need to exist they just did it to save a few mm of space Make a GPU 2 3X bigger but don't have an issue with that but have an issue with how much space they need for cable ports
I specifically avoided a FE 3xxx series because of these connectors turns out buying an EVGA card last gen was a good decision
Did you happen to bend it less than 35 millimeters from the plastic If so that's apparently user error I personally think that's bad engineering and don't blame you if that is the case
As if I need another reason to skip the 4000
Are we going to have to put liquid coolers on power cables too
I hope you're rich
Too much crysis for you
Zoid's got some opinions on this v kRkjUtH4nIE
Someone have to make a better connector and cable for power hungry card looks like those tiny pins cant take the amp
That's a shame But really these cards are sucking like 600W through those little pins if the connector's the slightest bit loose you're going to get significant heating That's the kind of issue that causes electrical fires in house wiring
oof that doesn't look good glad you were there when it started smoking
snap i feel pain looking at this Will nvidia refund you is it under warranty
NGL the connector gets warm on my 3090ti when Im gaming But not to the point I can't touch it or hold
First ones in didn't take too long 30 series didn't take long either lmao
Decreasing the contact surface area of each connector pin while increasing the total power watts not amps going through them got Nvidia all like What could go wrong Put a power limit on things going inside of relatively tiny spaces or use heavier gauge wire with larger pins You canna defy the laws of physics Jim
Que NVIDIA
Do we know of any cases of this happening with an OEM ATX 3 0 PSU 600W power cable connected to an ATX 3 0 PSU All of the toasted cables that I have seen are the NVIDIA adapter And the articles I ve read Digital Trends and Wccftech suggest that it could be NVIDIA s adapter and not necessarily the connector on the board and specifically the use of the adapter with a non ATX 3 0 spec PSU I suggested this somewhere else and was immediately downvoted I have my Gigabyte 4090 connected to an ATX 3 0 PSU with the 12VHPWR cable that came with the PSU and all is well so far fingers crossed of course
just saw this in my samsung
smoking that 12 pin adapter pack cigarettecigarette
I've been very anxious since all of this going viral so I contacted Zotac By the way they replied in less than 5 minutes wow did research online and everything point to cable needing to be straight and Nvidia is I followed the protocol and this is the best I could do with the 4090 in my Fractal Torrent and my PSU cable going all straight I had the cable above the card but they say not to bent it vertically so here's what it look like PS Also notice a tiny gap above the 12VHPWR cable if you zoom in at the picture but no idea what I could do little gap above the cable and connector dangerous As straight as I could do so the case can close Redid all the cable management to be all straight as possible x200B Tell me what you all think thank you
YouTuber JayzTwoCents who has been warning about this new connector for weeks calls it dangerous but says Nvidia doesn t agree I think you re worrying about issues that don t exist said Brandon Bell a senior technical marketing manager at Nvidia in an email to Jay last month Now I'm questioning whether Nvidia is actually looking into the problem if they think that this is an issue that doesn't exist
Nice job plugging your adapter in all the way
I feel like Nvidia is going to be mailing out a lot of replacement adapters Something similar to cable mods 45 degree adapter
That s gonna be a yikes from me dog
I see a class action law suit coming
Feels like the PCIE SIG didn't do enough mechanical testing when coming up with this new connection standard I bet there will be an update to ATX3 1 if these kinds of issues keep appearing
Why is there only one 8 pins on a 4080 but my 3080ti has 2 8 pins
It B
I bought a RTX 4090 MSI Gaming Trio and received it 10 19 22 After about 72 hours the system will no longer power on so long as the card is plugged into the system I am beginning to wonder if I had this same issue since my card was vertical mounted similar to yours with the adapter sagging slightly Not really sure how to get a new adapter and my cable mod pack doesn't ship till November so I might have just RMA it and hope Newegg doesn't screw me No visible damage to my card though
Pretty crazy but it doesnt suprise me really when I saw that 3090 destroyed their own vram this kind of problems where just a matter of time
Y all got me worried about my card melting my entire new build or worse my house face with tears of joy My bend is more aggressive than OP s
See this Gamer's Nexus news segment dated 9 20 22 v p48T1Mo9D3Q t 322s v p48T1Mo9D3Q t 322s Looks like Nvidia already knew about issues with this connector based on their internal testing but they went ahead with a full scale release anyway It's not a deficiency with the adapter but the connector design itself
I read all warnings about this connector Saw all the prelaunch reviews Watched Steve and Jay point it out Still hovered and added to cart Just got the tracking number today Felt a tiny bit of relief when BuildZoid called out probable user error The angst is building I pray this cable thing doesn't turn into a ishshow like this and some previous launches The difference will be this will be of RMAs and litigation
Welp JaytwoCent and Gamer Nexus warning came true Thank God I'm planning to buy 3000 cards Not really in the mood to waste so much money
And this is why I don't buy a 2000 card right away
nvidia can t stop dropping the ball these are high end enthusiast grade electronics for fuck sakes we pay extra to not deal with this
31st plug in sorry mate only good for 30
Congrats on your 1600 fire hazard Buy another one
I wonder why Nvidia needs to shrink the connector on the card itself I mean they increased the size of the card so there is more then enough room to fit a regular connector
So it begins
So if bending the cable makes the pins back out of the connector ever so slightly why didn t they design the connector to where instead of heat shrink you had a solid back to the connector where the wires go in so the pins couldn t physically back out Is Nvidia a bunch of rednecks now to where they just throw some tape on this shit and call it a day
NVIDIA The way it's meant to flame
In just the past two hours I ve seen several high profile tech YouTubers upload videos about this issue
Relax is part of the next gen graphical immersion
This was predicted to happen a lot before 4090 was released It s just Waaaaay to much dc power going through that little plastic thingy
Whats your psu
at least the card still works right
Blistering fast cards
What psu are you running
Damn hopefully the card itself didn t get cooked
Yeah that s not good That s a tiny adapter for what it all pushes through power wise
Amd nice
I noticed that some adapters connect to 3 PCIE connectors and some connect to 4 I wonder if the ones that connect to 4 are more prone to this issue
Out of curiosity and really hope this didnt happen but did the gpu set on fire while playing or did it just turn off
Don't panic The hit of the summer making another revival in the fall
is this happening is default setting with no overclocks
When you fuck up
I'm definitely postponing adopting cards with this connector until enough runtime has been had on alternatives
The ATX 3 0 PCIe connector is such a massive failure Hopefully there will soon be a 3 1 revision with a connector that is actually appropriate for the application and power draw
Hey guy's I'm getting a bit paranoid after seeing this So I'm posting photos of my connector's positioning and angle so can you guys help me if it's ok or not
The card that runs twice as
OP about to get disappeared
This happened at the time with my GTX1660 Out of the blue same conditions as always no load simply 'puff' Fire The retail said it was my fault somehow after I've sent photos descriptions and offered to pay to have it sent to a technician of their choice They basically told me to give up And that's how I lost a new GTX 1660 after 5 months of upgrading rantoff '
This is why I wasn't trying to rush to get a 4090 even if they were readily available I had a feeling this would happen There are going to be some fires going on Once these cards got out in the Wild the true stress tests begin
we can submit a recall notice to gov
That's my order cancelled I don't want the risk of loosing my home and family for a fucking graphics card
4090 literally melting people downvoted me for telling me i have no clue what i'm talking about enjoy your fire cards
Guess it really can't run Crysis
Collab with samsumg
I think it s fair to say PSU quality is going to be a factor this generation
I guess the 3090 ain't so bad now
Fucked
Those wondering after looking at all the cards out there only one has that silver square slither and Geforce RTX logo stacked over one another OPs machine kf Also worth noting Unlike some other custom designs today Gigabyte is giving you the whole 600 W maximum power limit adjustment range the default out of the box power limit is still the same 450 W as on the Founders Edition Oct 12 2022 text Unlike 20some 20other 20custom 20designs as 20on 20the 20Founders 20Edition That said we don't know if the OP cranked it up to 600w I think 450w out of the box on all 4090's should be safe and generate a significantly amount less of heat and obviously current vs max power Everyone should take a deep breath
Product recall
Don't you just love it when there is something released that was super expensive and not many people could get and then it turns out to have a massive problem like catching fire or some shit Hard to explain but it makes you feel like you dodged a bullet or something
You guys are affording 4090s I still running mine on 2080
Everything about this adaptor is a mess I have one of the larger mid tower cases and currently cannot put the side panel on because of this fucking adaptor Is there a technical reason for the 4090 needing it I understand the PCIe 8 pin spec is 150w but three of them and the 75w from the slot is still 525w Any reputable PSU can also do much more than 150w over an 8 pin Surely it would have been a better idea to use 3x8 pins on most 4090s and left this shitty connector for those with a 600w BIOS
The 4090 really wasn't so well thought out to its fullest
Imagine paying a few grand for this pile
Imagine spending so much money and then getting screwed by a cable
Looks like AMD changed their mind 4060s and 4050s Maybe they can still change the design or would that be too late After all they would have to alter the production line as well
What powersupply
I'm really curious to see how this evolves On one side you're using a GPU that is regarded as unstable or not on the same level as others On another the connector could have simply been faulty x200B Let's hope all is going to be good in the end
Too small for 600W max
Am I going to be the next victim u NV Tim It's a Asus Strix 4090 vertically mounted in a HAF 700 EVO powered by Antec 1300W platinum PSU Imgur Imgur Unless I bring the 4X 8pin PCIe cable to the front of the card or through the side which will look ugly I can't avoid the sidewards bend Any suggestions The only option I can think off is to buy a cablemod 12VHPWR extension cable or the 90 degree angled adapter EDIT After hearing feedbacks I have tried reduced the bend as below
Just like your money
You would think a company charging full pre built PC prices for a GPU would have thought a little more about the
Asus 4090 TUF Phanteks Evolve X Be Quiet Straight Power 11 850W Be Quiet Adapter Cable closed side panel without force on cable possible 450W 48 5 119 3F And still I don't like the 12HPWR Connector at all Silly little fragile connector
Steve warned about this Maybe you should contact GN and let them know about this v CmUb9sDS9zw Also this t 458
Never buy tech on launch let other people be the beta test
Jay2cents pretty much called this right in the ball
The weight alone of the 4 connector cables attached cabling can cause a bit of downward flex on that connector just naturally from gravity I don't know how anyone thought it was ok to have a connector with this kind of power draw be this physically small and fragile don't even get me started on the 30 connects service life
So would using a different cable be better than the one provided I was recommended this ref ppx pop mob ap share th 1 by some people
You ever put greese on your headlights and parking lights Something along those lines
Yikes
Curious to see what nvidia will do to remedy this for the Op as the community rep reached out if at all
You can also file a claim to your credit card for purchase warranty or something due to damage
RIP
I coulda sworn the YouTube channels reviewing this where using a quad plug adapter and the PSU would only output 150 watts per plugged in cable
How about that 90 deg adapter from Corsair Would that help
Damn that's very unfortunate yet glad that it seems nothing major happened as in it didn't catch fire and burnt your room house down
Yikes going to need a fire extinguisher case bracket on my next build
Are the both burned cards Asus Tuf 4090
just put some BGA solder balls into the slots and let it fuse to the board
Wiw
it s probably designed by the same guys who worked on the cigarette lighter power adapter in 1990s BMWs
Got my 4090 FE yesterday and finally had time for a long gaming session With an IR thermometer as close as possible to the plug it read 64c 147f The connector is really hot to the touch Worth noting i am using the Thermaltake PCIe 5Gen splitter cable No bend nothing straight into the card
Well done NVIDIA
I'm from the UK my Zotac 4090 came with a 3pin to 12v cable I see a lot of people have 4pin is that due to them being USA No issues so far with the zotac 4090 Had it since launch day It is paired with a HX1000W Corsair PSU I've been playing cyberpunk 4k psycho native for 3hr sessions 3d mark stress tests and Dvinity 2 at 120FPS 4K native I checked the cable today and it still looks mint I'm using 2x single PCIE cables plus 1x Dual cable with only 1 end plugged in Zotac card had a sticker that said make sure to use 3 separate cables x200B Inside view of case with glass panel picture taken from above
Lol maybe don t buy new cards the moment they are released
Would mounting the 4090 vertically be safer since mounting the card horizontally bends the cable Vertical mount would not bend or as much the cable
Someone didn t watch JayzTwoCents or Gamers Nexus
Here is another one width 640 crop smart auto webp s 1336387ec1b8b62730cac5ba33067ff2db066503
Considering canceling my 4090 TUF order with these shenanigans becoming really common even with so little cards at the hands of users
Everyone that has a 4090 now should probably get an atx 3 0 psu just to be safe
RMA it Don't see this as nothing more than an isolated issue x200B I prebent mine before instaling as my Gaming OC 4090 literally goes from front to back to the point where I don't need a support bracket in my Corsair 200T x200B Good luck
Cable was not bent What happened here
I will never understand how shit like this connector make it pass QA engineering inspection Hope u get a RMA for it
This post has been published at one of the biggest polish tech site 's hope that rma will go smooth
Can the ATX 3 0 PSU direct cable 12vhpwr be bend too Or it s only an adapter issue
haha
chanting RMA RMA RMA RMA
Is that the only power connector to that behemoth card
Which is why I'm waiting for the new ATX 3 0 PCIe gen 5 PSU to drop
As a Bully Maguire fan his Uncle Ben once said With great power comes great responsibility They should upsize to 24 volt railings and much thicker wires
Another reason for not getting a 4090 NOTED
those wires are too fucking small 600w 12v 50a 450w 12v 37 5A which is still to high for wires that thin Those wires are NOT thick enough
How could a company like nvidia with all the resources they have not come up with something better This connector is a disaster This connector has 6 12v this new connector can draw twice the
Is this some kind of rich person problem I'm too poor to understand
kwispy
If it was a MSI card they'd just say it wasn't installed by a professional and wipe their hands clean of it like they did to my 1k card
't design a good connector then at least use readily available XT90 or XT150 connectors
Ooof looks like a faulty cable That's an RMA for sure
For warranty reasons I'd refrain from posting PC pictures of the 4090 installed How the cable is bent can and will be used against you Just saying in general OP's cable looks fine
Can you do Rma I do believe electrical burns are often not coverred They may say it s not the product fault but the input the psu
One smoking graphics card lol
is this issue specific to the adapters being used if i have an atx3 0 psu should i be worrying at all my cable is slightly vertically bent at the glass
Lmao
Whelp guess I have to buy a nuclear reactor and a private Fire Department for my new RTX 4090
Praying this is only an adapter issue lol ATX 3 0 PSU looks like it was a SOLID choice to purchase in hindsight instead of reusing my old PSU
OP we need to know which model GPU and if it was running stock Which PSU Any Power Target adjustments
You ran it hard into detonation caused from a lean condition Richen it up a bit just a quarter turn
HEY
EVGA is like yep see why we got out
But we don't need to buy a whole new PSU right Just a new graphics card s
I would hold the horses for further investigation In the end 3090Ti uses the same connector and draws even more power I haven't heard about burning 3090Ti's yet
The 4090 is real
Holy Guacamole this is insane How can one avoid such situation
Those wires and pins are so thin No way it can handle the wattage Personally I wouldn't buy any card with that kind of connector until ATX 3 0 PS comes out But even then I still wouldn' 't look good Wires are way too thin to handle the wattage especially if you are going to run it all day and night a Triple 8 pin or Quad 8 pin would have been much much better since you are already plugging 4 8 pins to THAT
clown nvidia
Can't believe people have to use adapters on a 2000 product lol
This is why you don't buy the initial launch of new products Same with cars never buy the first year of a new model
6900XT has higher transients than a 4090 and the 3090ti had higher overall power draw than a 4090 plus higher transients And nothing burned Dude got unlucky or bent the shit out of that adapter Welcome to tech Fanboys thinking this is the next big can now leave this sub again
Scary I ve put a few hours on my 4090 BF V 4K with RT maxes it out most of the time and so far so good I ve a bit of a vertical bend but I m using a 3rd party adapter that is rather flexible Waiting on gamersnexus 3rd party adapter video to learn more but will keep using it for now
Oh snap
Our worst fears realized
NVIDIA Lolzzz
im so corious if they will replace that gpu on guarantee
How many watts does your psu have
So if someone got new powersupply and not use nvidia adapter Will be safe
Someone fudged up the power integrity
Which 4090 is this
Rip
I mostly leave my pc on when I leave but now I turn it off with my 't have these issues because i'm planning on buying that
Corsair needs to hurry and send out my cable I preordered from them haha Every time I m on my pc now I m worrying about the adapter haha Might just use the Corsair cable for a while and when the ATX 3 0 psu s become more available or even cheaper invest in one of those
Honestly I like the look of the 3 4 adapters going to the GPU Makes it look powerful
my good sir sorry for your loss
Meltdown prevention is the new overclock
Interesting that this hasn t happened to any FE card yet maybe something AIB s are doing their end to the cards
Reggie Moment
Reggie Moment
I regret bottling out of a 4090 purchase seconds before it sold I found the size of the card scary size comes from the required cooling which comes from the thermal risks I'm definitely after the 4nm efficiency but dont want to go all the way up to 450 W for it aswell I'd also prefer not to have one component thats so expensive I'd prefer 2x 1000 card vs 1x 2000
So what are the current recommendations if you own a 4090 What should I check what should I keep myself updated on Also what is the risk if the cable does indeed burn Is it a big fire hazard Or would it just mean the card and computer stop working Is there only a risk when actively straining the card as when playing graphics heavy game or could it also burn when the computer is just idle like when you sleep which would bad if there is indeed a fire hazard Also do anyone have any idea at what ratio this is happening How many cases are there Like is it 1 in 100 1 in 1000 1 in 10000 Also could I check if I am in the risk zone or not just by stress testing the card by running it in 3Dmarks etc and checking the temperature If I have ok temperature would that mean I am safe And finally if there is a problem should I contact Nvidia or the actual brand of card I bought Zotac
Thats not good
Yeah I'll stick with my 3060 ti lol
holy necro 's new
Why does bad stuff always happen when nvidia releases a new graphic cards
Make sure you take care to properly install your card and secure all connections My best tip is to install the adapter or power connector before slotting it to the PCI E slot on the motherboard That way you can be sure it is fully inserted and latched and if it's not it will come loose while you are inserting the card Also after installing the card confirm that the connector it still installed all the way and connector flush
You can always underclock rtx 4090 upto 350watts
WOW
People really blowing up like we've never seen a burnt 8pin pcie connector before I'll wait to see more reports before I scream that the sky is falling and demand a recall for my card I'm not a particular fan of the included adapter though Aside from being ugly it is also being installed in some depth challenged cases with the glass slammed shut and people hoping for the best They should know better than to not engineer for the worst case scenarios Luckily I have an atx3 0 psu so I don't need to use it A possible solution may be a new adapter from nvidia to affected customers
Huehuehue glad I decided to hold off on getting it until these things are figured out without fail there has been issues with each generation for early adopters Guess i'll stick with 2080 Ti for now It looks like this has happened to other people as well
What is your PSU
I like how they are using a new psu standard that was only reviewed once or twice and no physical products exist for consumers to use Personally I find it about as stupid as me buying a 3090ti
I feel sorry for this What psu were you running this on Even if it works looks like the connector on the GPU is messed up definitely contact the dealer you bought from asap
Were you using a 600w limit or the default power target Anyways sorry that happened This new connector is dumb af
It s quite concerning to me that this new connector will be the new norm going forward Whatever you do though just don t replace the adapter and keep using the card RMA it and get a completely new card This is first of all a fire hazard but that card is going to short at some pint if that connector isn t replaced which the manufacture will do
My cables are literally smashed against the glass side panel lmao Btw im using a lian li o11d case which is already pretty big Should i be scared
If recurring issue with a lot of people nvidia will honor
Quite concerning
Tf You running NASA skull and crossbones
sympathy
Ruh Roh shaggy fire
oops good thing they switched production
Another thing crossed my mind Would a 90 adapter solve anything It really is just moving the problem down stream when you think if it Sure you can now put the side panel on but it does not eliminate this issue If anything it adds additional points of failure There are now two pinned connections at the ends of the 90 adapter Furthermore once the 90 routes this nvidia adapter down you need to bend it down and under the gpu Then you need to bend it sideways again to go around the motherboard The 90 adapter technically will shorten the distance of allowance on these bends since the adapter will now snake tighter to the underside of the gpu
What did Nvidia say about this OP just watching JayTwoCents on this now
This connector was supposed to be in the back of the card so that you don't have to bend it in order to install it in the direction of the card It should came out from the back of the case directly on the back of the card and this would be very useful This idea with 4090 because this card is long and larger than the board so there was a great opportunity for this idea to be applied because the board will not remain an obstacle sorry for my bad English
Nvidia pulling an Apple trying to fix a non issue
This whole design is just garbage and adds way more complexity than necessary Replace 12VHPWR with an XT60 XT90 and call it a day If you need sense pins use a three pin version with an external resistor or piggy back the four pin thing like they did already
well my happiness of owning an 4090 last 1 5 days I was even letting my case slightly open to avoid bending the adaptor cable but even though in the connector burnt I already started the returning process It was an MSI gaming trio rtx 4090 RIP
More FAKE news just good plain old USER ERROR Cable not inserted correctly you'd thinking if spending so much on just the GPU you could build a fucking computer
I can't understand how the 450w 3090 TI has no reports at all of melting yet they put this connector on a 450w 4090 FE card and it has a chance of melting Why even use this connector other than upselling the price by another 5 10
i would be very careful believing this take it with a whole truck of salt i am waiting for more of these reports to show up only then i will take it seriously remember how that series x console was supposed to smoke
The adapter is shit
Yeah that's a good feature to put with a GPU a power plug that can melt down faster and better than a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Three Mile Island and Fukushima combined face with tears of joy
Considering the price this shouldn t happen s
1 500
oh no now you cant play cross gen games in 200 fps
This is why giving Nvidia money for this absolute disaster of a release is a bad idea November 3rd
Fretting you're getting micro vibrations in the case causing the connector to vibrate there is a grease you can use to help reduce the fretting we had this problem in a box we mfg and fix it with the grease
My eyes and heart is boomed
As someone who just build with a 3090Ti that uses this connect I m nervous I just keep telling myself Seasonic wouldn t supply a shit cable Right
Little sidetracking here but I do car audio A 600 watt amplifier requires 8awg power wire The 4090 recommends something like 850w How are these pins able to deal with the heat generated Is this why the plastic has started to melt
Isn't it great being on the bleeding edge
Need more info What psu do you have and how old is it Are you sharing any of the cables eg pigtail or they separate Was the cable bent hard to get it to fit
I hope 4060ti won't have this silly connector and will just come in with 2x or 3x 8 pins
Just saw this in an article on Facebook You're famous Lol
I see a lot of salty people here who don't have 4090s If it was a 3060 or 6900xt would you still be smug about it
why don't people just use two PSUs one tailored for the GPU and another for the rest of the system
Seems like a skill issue
Leans back in his chair with a grin on his face Lol
This connector is only a problem with the founders edition right Do other board manufacturers have to use this connector or are they free to put the old one on the card Also a RTX 4090 will cost you 2500 EURO's in my
Poor connector
so it begins
I don't understand why we didn't move to 24V with new connector standard for GPUs Half of amps and quarter of power lost on connectors and cables that would mean that 24V GPU would require quarter of connectors that current 12V one need
Hi u reggie gakil please check your PM
Two grand
People should send full specifications of their new high end graphics card and ask their home insurance companies how they judge the fire safety of these things Especially if they have any heat damage at all at the connector Temperature measurements at the connector would be great if possble If you don't want to risk your insurance fee to rise contact the local fire marshal Then include the responses in a class action against Nvidia Edit Some people seem to not understand If your house burns down and your insurance company finds out that high power electrical installations have not been done by a professional they will give you the finger and let you suit yourself The same applies if you use stuff that has been widely known for constituting a high risk regarding fire safety The power cable for the 4090 is marketed as totally safe which it is not It is also meant for an appliance which is very much meant to be able to be left running unattended for days Some renders take days to complete and the 4090 is one of the most fitting products for these uses performance wise
Reposting Extremely important The emphasis here is we're not sure if this is of statistical significance Yet of course nobody will listen to that because we have pitchforks Woo This happens to every series Hundreds of thousands cards were sold across the world or if not close to This was going to happen to some ofcourse It's always going to be the case Bad connector on this thing bad something anywhere The warnings signs were there yes but this is ONE case out of the thousands of people who posted on this sub so we're not including the entire world I imagine this happened quite a good few times in the wild but again what percentage of cards does this happen to How does it compare to the past generations
What happened
We must buy 90 angled cable from cable mode otherwise catastrophic
So what PSU was it I ve yet to see a comment telling us which one it was because I doubt it was a cable issue
I m going to wait until ATX 3 0 PSU s release now before biting the bullet on a 4090 and get a custom 16 to 16 pin connector from here for better flexibility
Watching the jayzTwoCents video about this now
I did limited my gpu to 80 power would this be a safe idea I've ordered a cable from cable mod I hope it will be fine
LOL You know that PCIe Gen5 power cable also known as 12VHPWR or 16 pin power cable is a new standard that will replace existing 8 pin 150W power cables with a single 600W power cable In order to comply with the 600W specs the cable needs to have 12 wires for the current and 4 data paths for the signal The data connectors ensure that the connection has been established and the card actually requires more than 450W of power In case those data signals are not present the power supply will feed up to 450W of power Glad you burned the card and not your house Plus why would you trust Nvidia Get your self a new power supply
Maybe a bad lose connection from cable to adapter
NVIDIA being really dumb here
Definitely don't mention that this wasn't used with an ATX 3 0 PSU if it wasn't
What do you expect from nvidia making them so tinyman facepalming light skin tonethey could of made them just little bigger with all that power going through them would of been better to also not use plastic around the pins
't happen before I put it in a water block
My friend had a 1000RMX too and it system was shutting down with it's 4090 power switch sparked he tested it's 850RMX psu that he had spair and it's perfect
I wonder if the adapters for the other 30xx series cards could have this issue too I believe i bent my 3060 Ti Adapter less than 35 mm
Has anyone here tried using this corsair adapter on there 4090 It s only rated up to 450watts however 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 12 pin GPU Power Cable p CP 8920274 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 12 pin GPU Power Cable p CP 8920274
I genuinely don t think this is a widespread issue
Physics and thermodynamics at play More wattage and current will require more and thicker wiring not less and slimmer Otherwise heat and catastrophic melt Then again we can use different conductors I have no idea what I am talking about but for some reason this seems like a rightt answer
Just buy a 6950XT or a 3090
We re going to see a lot more of this Moral of the story if you buy a 4090 buy a new power supply These adapters are not a great idea when the card needs to draw variable wattage This isn t just a matter of changing pin counts those extra pins are to communicate with the PSU so it can draw the correct voltage
Not to shit on cable mod and their angled adapter but do we REALLY need another point of failure with an already seemingly iffy connector
Que verg enza nvidia
v K6FiGEAp928 v K6FiGEAp928 Reminds me of this Something about these gpus needing new 3 0 psu's
The question arises Why is the 3090 Ti not melting Even that has a TDP of 450W and uses the same connector Do you really need to push it to 600W
ohhhh boy
Ouch Sorry homie
Any pics of it in your case before this happened
Ugh not good indeed Too much of a bend
Can someone answer me this Is something like this going to happen right away or with time If its with time those here thinking their setup is fine now might have this happen to them months from now
Is the bend on the power cable too tight That can cause the bend to heat up I've had outlets get that electrical smoke going because cable plugged into the outlet was at a 90degree bend due to furniture pushed up against it and all that did was power a 13watt LED With how tight cases are with this card to feed it power I can imagine a lot of 90 degree bends that are pushing 400watts Having case panel bulge so that they can fit the video card in and still put the case back together
All it takes is 0 001 of the customers out of a million to have a fire risk and you now got housefires Time for power mods replacing the socket with a soldered extension board with 3x PCIE or directly solder thick cables to the GPU and move the plug somewhere else
Had this with a 3090 back when I bought it The reason IMO was the contacts inside the plug had been to wide these tubes out of metal So there was a small space between some of the pins and the tube in the plug This cause a spark to appear and the plug and socket melted on the surface The card is still working though and never had a problem after that new cables
Reggie gakil you are still alive champ because we don't hear anything about in a day
Should undervolting the GPU fix this
So Nvidia ABI's are charging over USD 2000 for a melting card Idiots
the solution was found the connector has no safety margin 8 3 out of 8 5A 0 2A of safety margin against 6A of margin on the old connector the slightest dust the slightest connection problem the slightest overvoltage due to overclocking will burn the connectors
hahah idiot loool
there's like a few dozen people I've seen have this problem
What was the power output plug into
I'm sure this won't be the first occurrence I'm not really blaming Nvidia though as I'm sure ATI will eventually do something similar if not identical I think ultimately what might be best would be for VESA to provide a specification for a supplemental power only motherboard connector that is female resembling the 24 pin ATX power connector on motherboards be fixed to the motherboard and aligned with but physically separated from the existing PCI E slot separated by 2 3cm It would ideally be 16 pin to handle future power needs Future graphics cards would have an additional male power connector on them that would plug in to this supplemental power source One drawback to this is that removing graphics cards would require releasing two PITA plastic plugs when the existing plugs are already pain inducing for the fingers and sometimes a PITA to get to But it does seem like this would be electrically less risky less prone to shorting or arcing and require less cable histrionics
lmao im glad i bought a 6900 XT
I'm staying away from these cards I undervolted my 3090 to great results lower temps and power use If we can't do that with these cards then nope for me
Here come the pitchfork idiots Faulty cables happen nothing to see here It happens with every generation of card
Y2k me Thats HoT
How long did you have the card for I ve had mine about a week the same one you have with Corsair 1000watt psu and have game for 7 hours straight in one sitting
Lol imagine paying money for this garbage
I wonder if this has to do with your PSU not being ATX 3 0 I heard the new atx 3 0 psu communicate with your GPU to draw correct watts
If this ever happens to me and I'm not going to warranty the card I'm just going to desolder the connector and solder a pair of the old type on cables into the corresponding holes And then for the data part probably just make my own pigtail for that or something It's not something that anyone should ever have to do but if it comes down to it I will I guess BTW I'm a technician I don't recommend anyone else do this
v jNreBLVP6NU v jNreBLVP6NU i recommend people to check this out the guy just showed that it requires some serious misuse of the cable to cause that level of burn in As always jay2cents looks at at something for 5 seconds and creates his click bait
Don't use adapters for high powered devices That was true for the PCI E to Molex days It's true today
Non ATX 3 0 power supply
It s hungry for some serious power
Guys it is good or not msi rtx 4090 suprimx
I wonder if this can be fixed via a software patch If there are sense pins the card can obviously monitor each leg of the strand in turn monitoring each pcie connection If it can monitor various data points such as voltage and current draw maybe it can detect discrepancies that arise that indicate increased draw There undoubtedly would indications something was going wrong based on the gpus power consumption curve prior to it melting
What is your gpu and what's the TDP on that card and what was the power limit set at while you were gaming at that moment If you can answer that it will help a lot of people 4090 ought to be undervolted
4000 series high end cards are anti mini itx build I will never attempt this as much as I have always bought nvidia from 980 in each generation I think their business decision to do such thing is to convince people to dump mini itx high end build well safety first as long as AMD uses the old reliable cable I don't mind a little bit of performance loss in RTX titles
This is why you should've connected the card with 3min 4max SEPARATE cables The card was connected to probably 2 cables only splitted into two 8pins which techinically should've provided 288W 2 576 W max If the card was stress tested a lot or used by a low graded PSU this could happen and it's not because of the 600w splitter SOURCE FOR DUMMIES
Hard good luck fixed
I bet 100 cookies OP hasn't followed an operating guide on how to bend the connector 4 5cm from the card and not crush the connector But my guess is because not all the pins 1 to 6 are not burned down entirely that he used less thant 4 pcie 8pin cables to power it Sensors pins seem to no be affected at all
You love to see it
Looks like you had it a bit too tight towards the upper side That's based on how the pins burned I've seen these connectors burning mostly from poor cable management slack
Those cables are rated for 30 plu and unplug after 40 times or so it will cause hot spots at 2 5 hours after 10 to 30 hours it will burn Crap design from Nvidia Watched a jays2cent video
Perhaps the connectors on both the card and the cable should be enforced by metal instead of just cheap plastic
Also you are not supposed to use any adapters with the PCIe Gen5 You all need new power supplies
Media talked about it too it seems like this will happen RTX 4000 series are POS so far
That s why you use multi rail lol
In your setup picture it looks like you use just two PCIe powercables but plugged the daisy chain ends in So 1 to 2 On the right hand side of the picture you can see the loop curl back and into one of the power connectors you can't do that
bro i cant believe that happened to
Yeah those are poor quality connectors They only have like 10 service cycles
So how much did you OC that sucker before it started to melt
Just get a console
One reported failure out of thousands sold two weeks into launch under unknown circumstances ThE wArNiNgS cAmE tRuE 1 111 You people treat electricity like unknowable magic no wonder you eat up this shit
From Corsairs own website 600W load requires a 1200W rated CORSAIR PSU or higher 450W load requires 1000W or higher 300W load requires 750W or higher Sooo going by the above information It's possible that the OP's card was drawing more than 450W which Corsair states requires a 1200W PSU Yes they're talking about their adapter specifically but I don't see why that wouldn't apply here Take everything with a grain of salt Simple as that
Hahaha
Nice dt 1990 you got that currently from the b stock sales
No more OC for OP
Marvin face with tears of joy Wer h tte gedacht dass ich dich ausgerechnet in ner PCGH News wiederfinden w rde Terrorschockers ftw face with tears of joy
How many outlets have to recommend you buy a new psu instead of using the included adapter before people spending over 1k on a graphics card actually do it At the very least I ve seen recommendations to not use the included adapters but you d think a new psu wouldn t be a stretch considering the price tag
Are you able to put connecter greese in there I'm newer to pc and am honestly curious
Nice headphones
That's why you need to spend that extra cash on the power supplies with the new connector Edit instead of being sour and tanking my comment how about you help out a person who knows next to nothing about power supplies huh Ever think of that for a change Oh this guy has no idea what he's talking about well okay help me jesus
Obvious kinks where you bent the cable
F USD on a GPU and not get an actual ATX 3 0 complying PSU Feels like everyones blowing their budget on a card without the rest of their build being able to support it
Buy an ATX 3 0 PSU
Lol
GPU was in silent mode or OC
Quality PSU's and proper cable management are the issues The adapter is fine it's rated for 100w higher than a 4090 should typically go 600w for the adapter 500w on 4090 even with transient spikes So we can rule out the wires in the adapter itself being the problem USER ERROR ALL DAY EVERY DAY Same thing happened when the 30 series came out People were experiencing black screens even with the proper rated PSU Turns out due to the transient spikes BETTER PSU's were required I have two 4090's and they both work perfectly
Deserved
Looks like it's the custom cards that are overclocked requiring a 1000 watt power supply doing it That's why I got the founders edition
I already made a comment But wanted to add some more One quick fix for those that can't afford the downtime for warranty work Take the card apart de solder and remove the connector Cut the connector off the wire bundle and solder each wire direct onto the board A direct solder connection can handle the current being sent though the wire much better then a connector
First world problems talk to me when your hard drive goes negative on your 486 DX2 66 and then smokes like a chimney Glad you didn't have a house fire
LMAO hahhahahahahaha
May have been a power surge in your house make sure u do some research on joules You need a lot for a desktop PC like 1200 tripp lite is a good brand of surge potector the 6900xt was so power hungry with spikes that I had to make sure the power going in was clean my house is getting old
Y all have short memories
User error User error
Problem solved NVIDIA stated they tested these adapters are they're fine as long as you do not bend them and as long as it is seated correctly See image And obviously you need a good quality PSU Recommended 1200w 850 is not enough sorry
I see a lot like this as miner it caused by bad psu or bad psu cord even if you have good psu
Is this a adapter he bought not the cable that came with the card
Did you buy a PSU that is compatible with the 4090 What make and model is yours
Fake news posted by AMD
This guy ignoring comments asking if the cable was 't plug it in all the way reducing the contact points
It's just the overclocked gigabyte model that's doing this that requires a 1000 watt power supply
Which PSU do you use
Would be curious what 3rd part card this is as well as your PSU I only ask because I read around on my PSU that some of the cables that it uses can provide up to 300W per cable when this adapter only works with cables that provide 150W per line
small problem no one die
What PSU
No wheezing the jooouice
That looks like it could be a problem if you booted it up how much coul that damage
This has happened to me when mining in the past Always keep an eye on your cables Were you overclocking
Is this issue being overblown or should I legit hold off I've actually had a house fire before that I was thankfully home to intercept quickly aka call 911 My home would have burnt down had I been out I'm seeing lots of talk about this adapter heat issue but like any new product people usually add water to the grease fire and make the issue sound 10x worse than it is in reality Just not wanting to drop 2k and be paranoid at all times something could go wrong
ship it
It s M
Thought I'd chime in here for the purposes of accounting I have a GB 4090 Gaming OC I pulled the cable on my rig to check it's perfectly fine no signs of melting or heat problems whatsoever I've gone to PL1 33 and pushed the card hard for hours though there's no real sense in keeping at 1 33 I did it to verify operation at 522 W My cable is also bent the wrong way I'm not discounting any issues with the cable this specific adapter's thin solder pads seem to be a legitimate problem However mine seems to be working properly
We are very confident
Geez It's not their forte on cables Anyways those were free cables Aftermarket cables are available now and rated to handle higher loads
Did it cause damage to the card too Were you able to file RMA
crazy how these 4090 s were sold too early w o enough testing done now geforce should owe ppl money
Rays
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Ah yes power YeS
Mine is fine Must be muppets
Lol
It seems that it's only 4090 problem not 4080 Correct me if I'm wrong please
Back to you Steve
In other news this week Nvidia Power Connector is a fire hazard We weren't sure about that but after a few days of investigation and reaching out to users and confirming the problem we can now confirm the information The squid is burning and is now a fire hazard like the NZXT H1 case
JayzTwoCents did a video about this and when I told people about it and that you need a ATX 3 0 PSU to help prevent this as well as not bending the cable people downvoted me so I got rid of the comment We're gonna see a lot more pictures of this
I bet they will just say it is user error
Not only do we have to film ourselves opening packages but now we also have to take detailed as installed pictures so they can't deny warranty because we routed it wrong
pours one out for evga
Nvidia is going to have a massive PR nightmare if this is a widespread issue
WTF
u NV Tim
or did you overclock It's a shame what happened to you bro
im sorry man that sucks having a crash mid instance especially with friends sucks
What's your psu
I have the same card as you Did you have all 4 8 pins in or just 3

I dislike this 12VHPWR connector it is fragile and too small the provided adapter is ugly and heavy once installed with 4x8 pin altogether the connectors the cable put quite a strain to the connector on the card and you have to be very creative and know how to set up the whole thing not to put pressure on the connector and additionally sag to the card Everything after looks just disgusting I was able to do it properly for my msi 4090 Suprim Liquid X now everything sits right without tension to the card or connector with a very long and gentle band but the aesthetic is gone However the card is able to pull 618W peak reach 3015MHz peak it usually sits around 2940 2970 during gaming and draw around 450 550 590W Similar during Folding Home full power for 12H uninterrupted and the connector wasn't hot at all I could hold it with my 2 fingers it was just warm nothing extraordinary However I don't say that under certain circumstances this melting cant happen the connector itself is to fragile to small in my opinion for that intended power draw an engineering and development failure at highest level for such expensive card
Do you have a pic of how the adapter was looking when you installed it
do you have a picture of how it was bent i assume i'm leaving my case off though im running at 60 power i may not have to
What PSU did you use
Which 12vhpwr cable is that What's your PSU
I have this card but I'm power limited as I've had to daisy chain for the last 2 8 pin connectors Was your card set up to pull a full 600w And any overclocking
Do you have a pic of how you had it installed OP had his cable bent horribly right behind the connector so that kind of explains it in that case Edit Don't know why this is being downvoted This is being bent way closer than 35mm from the base of the connector and it's almost 90 degrees It's way out of spec
In both cases it was through the adapter right And how many plugs were plugged in 3 or 4
My man got a 4090 to play Black Desert with
30 is typical and normal for the molex mini fit Jr connectors we all know and love in the pc space Even before this new connector it has been 30 for years because some companies often don't want to spend the extra for gold plating Gold plated are often specified up to 100 mating cycles but these are still maximum numbers so it could be lower pQuery category 253A 2522PCB 2BHeaders 2522 2540numberofrows 253A 25222 2522 2540productname 253A 2528 2522Mini Fit 2BJr 2522 2BOR 2B 2522Mini Fit 2522 2529
Came here for this
You never had a graphics processing unit like me
RIP Robin Williams Man I liked him in a few movies but Aladdin was hella good Still weird that Princess Jasmine was based on the sister of the animator Mark Henn though
Have you guys released the 90 adapter yet
ill be using cablemod on my new build
That's the good marketing guys
This is good marketing
Ordered mine yesterday but it says shipping on 13 november loudly crying face
How bout sending out the product for the orders that were placed 3 weeks ago first
I take it your adapter is far less likely to experience a failure like this
PogU
Will the adapter be available to buy in India as well
I have the same psu Hope it's not the problem c
Sad thing is it'll probably be bare minimum of 1 month on an RMA replacement of any kind
still this should not happen on a 2k Euro gpu That shouldn't happen on anything sold in any civilized country no matter price It's fire hazard and can kill people
You probably had too much physical strain on the cable which led to poor pin contact
What made you stop gaming and check You said that it happened while playing RDR2 and then what You just randomly decided to look at your card You smelled burning Frame drops Curious
Did you overclock
Did you bend it anything remotely along the lines of this Because if you did you didn't read any directions on the topic
How did you realise it was burned Did your pc die mid game or did you smell something
when i was shopping for psu's the corsair customer support guy told me only the newer hx 1000i would support the 4090 idk if this is true or not tho
This looks like you didnt connect the 12 pin all the way in its a loose contact that easily plugs out My guess is that its both user error and adapter adapter is stupid and easily gets loose while you probably accidently pulled it out I noticed I could start my 4090 with the plug not all the way in Do not recommend Idk if you have a picture to confirm this that you could share
I've been hugging my 1080ti a lot latelyface with tears of joy
Don t forget the liability wavier lawyers and sourcing a notary
Exactly and if they need more some psu do have 4 6 cables available and they can just add a 4th 8 pin on the gpu Yes it s ugly but more safe man shrugging light skin tone
This is the thing that confuses me most it's a new connector that isn't solving a problem that existed in the first place Other than super super niche SFF builds that can't fit more 8 pins but then they can't use this anyway since it can't be bent x200B NVidia really said lets make a new connector that literally solves nothing and creates a fire hazard
I like where your going with this so the 4090 TI will have an on PCB power adapter with a 3 pin line cord next to the HDMI and Display Port straight to the wall socket
Probably offered him bofa deez
We send u another 4090 this shit never happened you got it or We send u another 4090 now say something positive about us Something along those lines
don't sue us for nearly burning your house down
Gonna guess it was something like Hey reggie gakul just saw your reddit post and I think you're worrying about issues that don't exist There's nothing to worry or panic about it all just works man Brandon Since that's been their traditional response ever since the clear safety issues with these connectors were raised externally Probably was even more smug and rude when it was almost certainly raised internally too
my boy evga was smart enough
Hey man using the heat from the 4090 to pop the popcorn will void your warranty
That s another point of failure though I see your point regardless The connector should ve designed better for sure
The cable should have a 90 degree angle from the factory another adapter weakens the connection and increases the failure points It still doesn t address that 600w via this connector has little safety margin just asking too much from that small connector
TBF if it was an EVGA power supply that connector would be in top notch
As someone with an MSI Suprim X Liquid im on the fence with returning it Despite CableMod having some 90 degree angle connectors this whole thing just stinks of corporate greed Nvidia will deny it and you will be left with one of two things A charred home or a charred 2000 paperweight D
lmao yea it all just house burns down in background
If I may ask how the fck do you afford this shit Whatchu doing
I'll wait for the EVGA version
It ain't worth that much money anyway I'll wait for 5xxx
This is why considering wire pin gauge insulation thickness and style and performing high potential tests that simulate a short term overload on cables is important as a manufacturer The Molex Micro Fit 3 0 the ATX3 0 PCIe power connector is rated for 5A per circuit pin by Molex I trust Molex far more than I trust Nvidia for rating their plugs and sockets It doesn't seem they thoroughly considered the consequences of putting more and more voltage through connectors like this they're going to get ridiculously hot They did consider this by using a plug specification that is rated for 5A per circuit of continuous power draw which gives a maximum continuous power draw of 720W for their configuration 12 pins 12 circuits As I said to someone else's comment it appears that they did not take into account the fact that the plug and sockets are not going to be in ideal conditions and it is the fact that the plugs are potentially going to have lateral forces on them leading to bad pin contact and the resulting heating up and melting
The post is out there They can remove it all they want but that image isn t going away lol
As someone in the military god I hope its better than military grade
Fine Cardboard it is
higher voltage Higher than what It's literally called 12VHPWR If it were higher voltage like 24V there wouldn't be any problem because 25A would be easy for 12pin
Ye i played rdr2 when it happened
Buildzoid did
Haha so true I'm waiting for user x reddit posted
per reddit user smokeypenis69 420 this cord is a fire hazard
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe GPU's on fire off the PCIe of a Tomahawk I watched PSU's glitter in the dark near the rear fans All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain
Buildzoid already has video with his rambling thoughts Still looking forward to GN
4 6 pins
Gamers Nexus already covered how huge of a risk this was then had to rebut nvidia's incorrect misinformed MARKETING response Sorry for OP and any other vics
i think jayztwocents and GN mentioned possibility of this
400 w
I am going after 12 rtx 3090's they have been tested good and work without fires
Card looks like a Gigabyte Gaming OC
Aorus Master I haven't seen any out yet
You're the 4th one I saw with this cable issue x200B I've been scrolling for 2 minutes
Did you take any pictures of the cable
Out of curiosity did you the card as is from the box OR did you limit maximum power through If you did limit maximum power to what you capped it to
Well apparently 2000 is nothing for you xD why buy such an overpriced product
Did you hear that Seasonic were working on a 12VHPWR cable I've not seen it but I'd be interested to see how they've approached the quality safety issue
Agreed and on top of that the risk of damage to other components in the rig which will be a nightmare to get compensated for
Yep
Yeah and I think after that the mighty PSU God johnyguru had come out and said it wasn't an issue and Jay was clueless or something to that effect And now here we are
Dude is a massive twat and shills whatever companies send him
Everyone in this sub is a circlejerk of hating him and saying everything he says is untrue
He talked about the connection cycles this stupid all cables have similar cc He don't know the reason for sure but most likely the bend that cable mod warns about and not that He's an idiot
So take off all your shrink
Some might tell you is fine some will tell you it's not Truth is we actually don't know Cablemod recommends the first 35mm from the connector to be straight but that is with their cables
They used a very similar 12 pin plug for the 450w 3090Ti
I want my PC to have TWO power cables goddamn it
Judging by OPs silence it would seem he s already sleeping with the fishes
They used a very similar 12 pin plug for the 450w 3090Ti AFAIK this hasn t happened yet to those
I own a 3080ti FTW 3 and I know it s factory overclocked a bit but uses 3 8 pin connectors I was surprised when I received my wife s new FE 3090ti with the same tiny split connector cable as this Should I be worried
The plug should never do that even if overpowered The wires tend to melt first This seems like user error
600 if you connect all 4 and opt to draw more
Me pulling 3000 Watts trough a normal old wall plug Electricity is no magic Thousands of cards running fine one of them burnt connector under unknown circumstances We had burned connectors on cards with lower tdp and for sure fitting connectors before and more than we have of the 4000 series so far
Not sure what kind of power limits the AiB has but per spec you have 6 9 amp pins which is a total draw of 648 watts
It's only too much when the resistance is increased on the connector Because the connector is tweaked by a bend in the cable to close to the connector It decreases the contact patch which ups that resistance and when resistance goes up so does the temp When the connector is properly connected it will handle 600w
I genuinely think that if this issue persists and we see more of it nvidia will have to send out 90 degree adapters to customers
Is It unix server or windows
You can't bend the part anywhere near the connector but you can bend it a bit further down the cable Otherwise this will occur
That's a good point A replacement squid might solve this issue by itself Whether or not you'd want
Hard to say wtihout more information from OP You should watch bullzoids video though as he discusses the weaknesses of the cable itself and how easily this could happen because of bending and just bad design
by not forking out cash for something so stupidly power hungry x200B y'all can eat 3k CAD Canadian DollHairs for a goddamn 4090 that's stupidly power hungry over their older models
To not buy a 2000 dollar overpriced card and simply wait It's generally a good idea to wait when any new electronic rolls out
Dont buy it yet
Properly handle the connector and make sure is well seated if one of the connector is bad there's no way to avoid and this apply to older cards and connectors too
Undervolt
Based on your username and comment I am 109 convinced you really did repair arcade games in the 90s
As a sign guy who repairs alot of led pricers and led message centers I also called this If sign manufacturers made parts with actual good connectors id lose alot of work Especially hearing Jayz2cents talk about the connectors I've just been waiting for all the melted connector stories to start
My credit card company sure can
I m still rocking away somewhat on my 1070
You don t need both of your kidneys do ya
No All of them so far use it
And the entire apartment building with multiple families going ablaze in the middle of the night because someone left PC rendering overnight and went to sleep
Das Auto Melt
And likely just as cap gate this is also bullshit that nobody will talk about in a couple of weeks because it's just a couple of unlucky customers of brand new hardware out of thousands that have no issues
The amount of wires is not the issue but they have significantly reduced the size of the connector and by that more than halved the contact area of each connection point Someone was hellbent on using the new connector over a 16 pin version of the classic Molex Mini Fit
More power smaller cables less metal contact point Big brains engineering
EVGA took the only parachute off this plane Smart move
I miss riding the curve of Moore's law
Forged in the heart of a dying star
Yes the adapter is for PSU's that are not ATX 3 0 The atx 3 0 psu's have the 12vhpwr cables and deliver the 600w of power properly but those cables should not be bent either because they are still liable for causing strain on the connector
I mean at that point they can just add a power socket pointing out and have an external power supply Imagine if they needed to make the pcbs even bigger
so you can just plug in your mains power cord directly to the gpu And deliver 230VAC directly to your GPU PCB rectify it keep HV separation cool it synchronize voltage with the one from pcie All that inside standardized ATX PC case With GPU already taking 4 slots Doubt it could work at all
Tiny wires do not carry a lot of current either me personally I will never use the new connector Nvidia is trying to get others to adopt Glad aib so far are still using the older trusted connectors
Oh actually they misheard what the engineer said it was All is on fire
All of the other brands I ve seen use the adapter
The 30 series adapters don't utilize the 12VHPWR pins My 3060 Ti FE has been running fine with the adapter for close to 2 years now even overclocked
Theres no way this isn't gunna be covered under warranty unless op is stupid enough to admit he did somethings wrong Plus I wouldn't try myself but if you could get another connector you should be able to solder the new one on My soldering skills are ok but given how expensive the card is I would look for someone with better skills
everyone does GN jayz2c zoid with the i hope not at the cost of partners
JayzTwoCents just put up a video too v HAZWwwHScaQ v HAZWwwHScaQ
nothing to do with it there was a contact failure resulting in excessive resistance a problem that could and did affect the molex mini fit 8 and 6 pins too
He tried to reproduce and couldnt get anything close to hot enough to be a problem v z58lEnnX1k ab channel JayzTwoCents v z58lEnnX1k ab channel JayzTwoCents
Yaaaay 0 25 for everyone
Not OP but in my experience it just smells acrid
That fire was definitely up to something though
It smells toxic Not fishy It smells like burning plastic except painful as well
That's usually capacitors that smell fishy after letting their magic smoke out
It splits into 3 8 pins
The 3090ti has 3 8
Looks like 12 pins to me and apparently it carries 4x the wattage of the typical 8 pin cable
The connector on the card is 12 4 pins 6 power 6 ground and 4 data more like advanced sense pins The PCIe 8 pin connectors we are used to only have 3 power pins as some of the pins are sense pins to tell the card the cable is there and that it is an 8 pin not 6 pin connector the 6 pin connector has 2 power pins The power limit for a a PCIe connector is fairly conservative but if the PSU or cable maker designed ONLY to spec it became accurate many PSU cable makers over designed the cables with thicker wire The adaptor is should be built to assume the PCIe cables it connects to are ONLY to spec so 150W per 8 pin cable However theres 3 power pins per cable for 12 total going to 6 power pins I don't know HOW they do the double up but they have to No matter how they do it balancing the power per wire on the PCIe connectors is going to be a problem it seems to balance per cable
Surprised no one saw this coming the day we found out the 4090's required kickstands
Show us the build Lol hope nothing crazy happens with your stuff dude
yep even cable mod knows their is issues
So like why do we need a special converter cable to connect to the GPU Cant they just used 4 regular connectors directly into the GPU Seems like this custom design is causing issues Unless they have a special all in one cable from the PSU to the GPU
I definitely wouldn t leave it on when I left the house That could end in disaster
Thank God I'm planning to buy 3000 cards I don't think 3000 way SLI is supported any more
account superficially suppressed with no recourse by r Romania mods Reddit admins
3000 cards have the same plug lolol But this is almost certainly user error OP just didn't install the plug seated fully Pins are rarely the first thing to fail when it comes to high wattage The components on the board or the cables themselves tend to melt well before the plug My guess is one of the pins were poorly seated which induced higher resistance and therefore more heat until the plastic housing starting to burn
And nvidia won't stop dropping the ball until people like OP stop buying their shit
Wait till you hear about high end enthusiast cars We pay extra for decreased reliability
gotta trim the bushes to make the tree look bigger
Manufacturing costs It's way cheaper faster to make the cables if you have it where you can crimp the ends of the wires shove them in the back of the connector and hit it with some heat shrink tape to provide strain relief than having some sort of plastic back that holds the wires in place or where you have to solder the wires into the connector housing That and or they caught this issue late and tape is a faster and cheaper solution over getting new molds made for the connector
Yeah was gonna say didn't Jay warn us about this I haven't seen anything from GN about it but I'm trying to spend less time on youtube so I may have missed them
Correct me if I'm wrong but the contacts look smaller than in the old PCIe power connectors too What were they even thinking with that design of this thing
That plastic has no relevance it's just a plug It's the metal wires that are too thin for that many watts Either that or just flimsy connector design that shorts stuff
Amd newer cards also will use 12pin its not nvidia that enforces the standard but another company
Not OP but yes it happens at stock
You should be fine Unless you aren t and it catches on fire and your house burns down You can never really be sure
Lateral bending makes the connector extremely susceptible to fires Be extremely careful Watch the buildzoid video on the topic it explains it in good detail v kRkjUtH4nIE
Lol no doubt You see how they reacted to Jayz2cents when he mentioned a concern about the new adapter
Yeah it's a big concern for sure my other issue with the 4090 is the DP1 4a connector makes zero sense and might be enough to keep me from getting one despite the AV1 encoding being a huge deal for me
Nah this is user error Plugs don't fail like this before other things fail first I've got a 3090 ti that pulls 450W as well and my connector looks perfect after months My guess is the plug wasn't seated fully meaning one of the pins overheated
These things are thoroughly tested for many months before they ever see the light of day by an organization that does not create the cards It's their standard not nvidias and they set the standard for all pci plugs This is most likely user error and the problems are sensationalized by people like jayztwocents
Now you can tighten your home instead
I'll be sticking with my 3080 TI Founders E

A fool and his
AMD never planned to use 12VHPWR
Corsair RM1000X
10 says the adapter wasnt fully seated
Edit My math is wrong but Im going to leave it as the idea is the same just sub the new numbers I did it based on all 50A going over 1 wire The vdrop for 18g 1ft wire at 9A is only 12v and 07v for 16g It's def better but still lowers the 8 9 overhead left in the design The flex and ATX 3 0 logic also isn't changed just it's designed specifically to cover all of the vdrop instead of some of it If the max wattage is 600W then yeah poor component matching The pins are rated for 9A They may be using a higher current pin but for math let's say 9A 12v x 6 Pairs 12 pins 9A 648W So that's over the 600W But If you're using a PSU that uses 18awg wire and has 12in of PSU power cable you're getting a 64v drop or the GPU is only seeing 11 36v 16awg wire gives 4v drop or 11 6v So now the math is 11 36 x 6 Pairs 9A 613W 11 6 x 6 Pairs 9A 626W They designed with 10 wattage overhead but then by using it with standard components you the consumer drop it to 4 and 2 for 18awg PSUs This is why ATX 3 0 is important and flex at the connector is problematic ATX 3 0 can boost the 12v rail to 12 2v this means the vdrop over the cables can now be compensated for lowering the current consumption back under the max rated The flex causes problems Bec it's run at the max current rating No flex means the round connector is able to better distribute the electrical load evenly Once you flex the cable you're forcing the pins to favor one side over another lowering the contact patch and pressure causing overheating and melting Nvidia got lazy and greedy and decided to make the market adapt to them I hope it blows up in their face What you guys need is someone with a bunch of cards and run them at max load and see how long it takes this to happen Connector max ratings are not meant for 24 7 So maybe this was a way to go limit mining or create a new market for custom designs meant for 24 7 use I'm assuming the latter You'll prob see soon the consumer cards are going to have a hard limit on how long they can be used at max power You used to be able to get around that with better cooling but now if they make the connectors the weak point You have no choice but to upgrade to their pro mining 24 7 use card
If THAT makes the connector and card burn then they need to recall every single one of these
You must cut off these blue clips immediately And i think we must buy 90 angled connector from cable mode otherwise catastrophic
im far away from rtx 4000 series knowledge becouse of priceses i dont get interested and didnt read much but u shouldn't bend the cable folks say so i can give u a suggestion i know it will look worse but u can try to pass 12VHPWR over the mobo power colored ones in this way it will bend less imo but u are the owner im just talkin while looking a photo u know how it really looks like and how much it will bend
You should only be bending it about 35mm from the connector This is dangerous the way you have it currently
Extremely dangerous Do not vertical mount the card as it s bending the cable horizontally Wait for Cablemod adapter Don t bother with looks of the card for now We are talking fire safety here I have been running with the side panel off for 10 days
We need cable connector cooling fans
I'd recommend taking a look here we'll be dropping a 90 degree adapter soon enough that should help a lot of people out with this issue You can see that here
I would not run that at all I'd remove the bend and just trade ugliness for safety Or install a temp sensor probe that will alert you when the plastic connector gets dangerously hot
Intel designed this connector
The smallness I really don't get Like it has a similar number of ports as two eight pins minus two grounds which should be enough to supply the power but why did they need smaller pins Even if they hadn't shrunk the pins the new port would have streamlined things and would have been smaller than the three 8pins you'd typically see on a 450w aib card
nope a different cable won't help as cablemod put it don't bend them vertically or horizontally
The only one I recommend is the cablemod 90 degree cable Not sure if it's available for purchase yet
My guess is Nvidia has asked him to send the card and cable to him for inspection and they are likely sending him a new FE 4090 or perhaps an other Asus Tuf to replace it exactly This way they can inspect the parts for manufacturing issues etc while trying to figure out what happened in addition to questions about the build
Can t be his fault if it s guaranteed safe It s meant to make sales once released
That cable looks like a normal 12 pin without the other 4 pin
As long as games will keep coming out on last gen of consoles I know I won't really need to change my 2070s
Thousands of cards 2 reddit users Your math seems kinda off mate There were far more people with exploding VRMs during New World's main menu Saw no big crisis or recall there either
My 6900 XT TUF order will stay on
what They use the exact same type of cable
You re doubling your risk factor with the new power supply by having two connection points with this limited flex If anything the old style is better
Has nothing to do with the power supply I would agree with you more if you said Everyone that has a 4090 now should probably get that CableMod 90 angle adapter
theres 4 pcie 8 pin to this one each provides 150watt
Those pins are each rated for 9 5 Amps each which is honestly more than enough about 57 Amps total it s really about how good the contact is in the connector You really don t need that much cross sectional area to carry an amp
4mm2 is rated for 37 However the connector is the and if any part of that arrangement of pins gets pulled twisted or distorted out of alignment and thus loses the full metal on metal contact area required then you will get a problem which will instantly result in over heating of the other pins taking up the slack Here's a link to cable sizes cross sections and safe accepted Amperage ratings for cables to determine safe limits
they never came up with the connector intel did
Well apparently it s not the power that goes into the card but rather the connecter itself that is shit so slightly less rich person problem
If they deny RMA for that the Internet will riot
You're going to be fine no extreme bend on the connector is the key to success and you have got enough space On this topic there are literally thousands of people who are arguing against Nvidia in bad faith instead of providing actionable advice and steps that one can take to ensure a safe build I despise this behavior on Reddit and in Tech Youtube sphere right now Fearmongering instead of being helpful
No chance in hell he she will tell you that Especially after the nvidia mafia got to him Probably sending him a whole ass new rig with a 5090 to keep him her quiet
This guy tunes
I have to agree with that And hate it when ppl say its 10wires Its the same as a thick wire But its not Many wires next to each other create more heat Induction exists
This is by far the strangest take I ve heard on the topic of computer parts
they dont if they have a powersupply with the correct cable but nobody really does
LOL what Make sense
MacBook has entered the chat Try 2 600
Or maybe huge corporations should get their shit together to avoid issues like this Idk why you re blaming the consumer for simply buying something
Usually the GPUs don't catch fire on any model
And this is why warranty exists
Too early to tell either way
All of em
No one can confirm it yet cuz the new psu isn t widely available yet
Don't mix and match PSU cables If you have a Corsair PSU then only use cables rated for that particular model Modular power cables are not the same and the pinouts vary by manufacturer You will easily burn out your GPU
worst case scenarios Ha
the inbox adapter should have been a right angle
If i gamed on a 1440P display i would have kept my 2080ti also but im playing on a 55 C1 OLED and HDMI 2 1 is needed for all the features
default
I mean that looks pretty bad I would see if you could get a cable mod adapter It ll probably be better than that
This is really bad and will damage the cable over time you need that connector to stick straight out or it will get damaged and is a larger fire hazard
Wow yea that s too much and at the worst part
Yeah looks like a lot of stress on that
Adapter wouldn't work you don't want extra connectors between PSU and GPU PSU vendors supplying 2 cables one with angled male connector with 90 degree pins inside from factory and one with straight connector would do the trick
It s at the end of the pcb actually The card itself is much smaller than the cooler You d have to have a very janky extension from the pcb itself to the end of the shroud
GN only recreated the melting when the cable was incredibly unsocketed plus he bent it to the side He tested the exact same loose connection but didn't bend the cable and there wasn't even heat up you're being harsh implying these people are idiots or something when the high resistance parallel connection is caused by putting some bend on a connection that feels and looks like it's seated fully while several 4090 model adaptors MSI Trio Asus Strix AORUS Master don't even noticeably click when latching
Use 5th gen power supply with rtx 4090 this power supply has cables for rtx 4090 and 1600 watts 5th gen PSU GPU wires has capacity of 600 watts of current 450 watts of rtx 4090 will not melt it
Thanks for the support D
You say ' s' but you're dead right This is a gpu the price of a rather tidy car They need to do better Way better
Or 2200
Senseless comment Warranty
Can't wait for all the shocked pikachu faces when amd new gpus also expensive asf Just like their zen4 cpus
Seasonic doesn't But seasonic didn't design this crap connector It is an engineering flaw and not a material flaw
No No AIB is shipping a bios capable of more than 600w Many are only supplying a 450 bios actually
This connector pulls 600W The issue is the Nvidia reference design It was poorly engineered which is Nvidia's fault
It only requires 8awg because of the distance from the battery 10awg easily handles 600w at shorter cable runs With these smaller cables you have the power split across several so you need to add up the total cross section area to compare to a single wire 10awg is around 5 26mm 2 8awg is around 8 37mm 2 so for 6 cables to match 10awg they don't need to be more than 87mm 2 and to match 8awg they'd each need to be around 1 4mm 2 16awg is 1 3mm 2 so 6 pairs of that would handle only slightly less current than 8awg and 6 pairs of 14awg would handle more The wire itself is plenty large and shouldn't heat up with 600w of draw The issue here is probably bad connection at the pins which causes heat to build up Each pin needs to handle like 8 5a which isn't a huge amount but with such small pins they need a really good connection to handle that Bend things around or even just not fully seat it and you'll have heat problems
Because the power is distributed between all the cables Not each pin needs 850 w It is likely that they are still under gauged
850W for PSU and whole system not just GPU lol
In addition to what everyone else said it's the connector that melted not the wire This connection is meant to handle 600W max across all 12 pins so 8A per pair of pins The fact that only one row of pins melted suggests to me that the connector was under sideways strain If the pin and socket aren't making a solid connection with each other it'll act like a thin wire and heat up The worrying thing is that almost all of these connectors will be under side strain in people's PCs especially with such a massive card
4 seperate cables psu is 2 months old
Wattage should be much lower with 4060ti It should be less problematic Still don't want to bend these cables too much
I see a lot of salty people here who don't have 4090s If it was a 3060 or 6900xt would you still be smug about it Bro I'm on 1070 So yes
Ive actually been considering this I have an extra 850W PSU laying around and my 011 Dynamic has support for 2 PSUs
How should this fix the problem with the connector The connector probably had poor contact or the pins are too small so the connector acted as a electrical resistor which makes the connector melt at high current Nvidia should start using appropriate sized connectors like this
Because most cases don't support two supplies
This connector is used on every single 40 series card I have seen so far and OP's card is clearly not an FE Regardless one faulty connector is not cause for this much concern
24V would be possible with a two or quad rail PSU by just wiring them serially But most modern PSUs don't use multiple 12V Rails anymore as a single rail can be implemented more efficiently and has better load balancing Adding a 24V Rail will not happen because the CPU is 12V and it makes sense for load balancing issues and price size of PSUs that GPU and CPU share the same voltage A PSU with just 24V instead of 12V would not be backwards compatible with any hardware not even Hard drives If they drop backwards compatibility they will go directly to 48V because this is already a standard for a lot of server hardware including CPU VRM OAM Accelerator GPUs like H100 and Mi 250X as well as network equipment like switches Nics etc But why not stay with 12V for a while It is not that there are hard connector space constraints in the PCIe Format considering how big a 4090 actually is and how little area the connector occupies There is ample space for better connectors nothing wrong with multiple 8P PCIe Cables and or a possible uprated 12P or 16pin variant for ATX 3 1 It is just important to ditch the stupid Micro Fit 3 0 Crimp contacts and return to the the tried and tested 4 2mm Mini Fit which offer much higher Current rating and lower heat density than the 3 0 Connectors
24V brings other issues and inside the gpu in this case Higher voltage mosfets have higher RdsON and switch slower so you will have more losses in them And increasing the input voltage of a buck converter decreases its duty and adds ripple to the inductor current so you now have more losses in the inductor too A higher current just needs more copper and better connections which are more cost effective and give a better overall performance
quite a bit more than a few LOL
Someone hasn't seen benchmarks yet
It's amusing that you think the insurance staff will even know what a GPU is let alone have the risk considered and rated within their systems and underwriting
Class action for a single failure What are you smoking They will replace this single card that failed look into what caused it and test to see if it's a hardware fault and then determine if they need to put out a recall Your first response is to suggest a class action for a single item failure Thats not even possible Are you high bro
At this point there is not much you can do at those power levels Probably soldering 1cm thick wires directly on the PCB won't cut it either at those amps I think somebody will push for 24V or 30V for graphics so they can reduce the current delivered and make the VRMs work with that
Then include the responses in a class action against Nvidia The license agreement for the nvidia driver package includes an opt in to arbitration
Nvidia should give them out for free Imagine paying extra to replace a faulty cable on your 2000 gpu
apparently it is a cable issue
3 0 PSU's are already out for sale I am personally using Toughpower GF3 1650W Gold
Moddiy does excellent work I have a custom cable on my RTX 3090 they made for me and my PSU
And it's not even necessary It's almost as fast at just 320v Since many users have no idea how to undervolt or limit power draw they should have a simple option in Geforce Experience
It has nothing to do with the power supply it has to do with the connector on the video card and the connector on the cable
If you strain any connector you gonna have some trouble It's only partially up to Nvidia Edit to clarify my point which is anything but original Crimped connectors are specifically sensitive to cable strain for a lot of reasons They're not welded to the wiring they do have some wiggle room in the housing and the cable insulation is crimped pretty much flush to the housing itself This means that you should not bent them near the housing especially horizontally in case the housing is substantially wide That's a mantra when doing cable harnessing and it's absolutely nothing new This is true for the vast majority of wire to board connectors on the market even non crimped ones Nvidia is 100 at fault for not blasting this advice everywhere on the packaging But it's not an inherently poorly designed connector not in terms of current ratings nor in terms of mating cycles It's surely not the right connector for the job in case which is power delivery on a product that will be used by inexperienced users too
Connection looked ok from a glance
Why does it matter Nvidia never said you need an ATX 3 0 PSU Not to mention there are barely any on the market and the few that are available are hard to come by
Does it even matter Nvidia said the adapter has a chip inside it or something that determines how many 8 pins are plugged in which would indicate this to be a quality issue with the adapter regardless of PSU that was used
COULD HAVE WOULD HAVE
That's an industry standard connector not a proprietary connector nVidia arbitrarily made tiny It's just not widespread yet
This isnt a proprietary connector
Widespread or not just one pc catching fire is enough for nvidia to do something about it
the problem that this can happen with rtx 4000 Absolutely insane
This is why I just get the Plumbus You just push the dinglebop through the grumbo and if you see the phleeb is extended you never have to think about it again
Physics and thermodynamics at play Yep homer already new about that in his crib
The issue is that there are not a lot of power supplies with the new port yet I am looking to upgrade and its hard to find a ATX 3 0 PSU its going to take manufactures until the end of this year to start getting them out and with all the people wanting to get 4090s the PSUs are going to be selling out when they show up
Our 90 degree adapter will help with this issue and should help with preventing it from occurring actually as it can directly help with ensuring cables aren't bent too early and you can get cleaner runs going
Doesn't the 3090 only have the 3 8 pin connectors The 4090 has 4 8pins
is the 3090 a bit smaller so that the connector didn't have much issues with the side panel I've seen a lot of people smash that against the glass with the 4090 which must have loosen the connection just enough for it to cause an issue Yes the OP did have vertical but i believe he had horizontal first I myself when i went to close the side panel noticed the issue so i left it open till i got the vertical mount and then an atx 3 0 psu
it uses x3 8 pin connectors
It's built on TSMC 4nm It's got several architecture upgrades it's raster performance is like 90 better than the previous generation and the watt to performance is significantly better than the
I'd argue the cables are a dumb design too Who thought that going from multiple larger connectors to a single one with smaller pins and less tolerance was a good idea Wasn't at all surprised when it came to light that there were issues with increased resistance melting connectors cables and shortened lifespans Dumb
Armchair GPU designers showed up
It is a little concerning that is sure but I think as long as you make sure the cable is well seated and not bent close to socket it should be ok or buy aftermarket angle adapter
If you watch buildzoids video on this post you would see that it's entirely user error cable mods instruction indicated to not leave the cables leaning at the ends more typical to vert mounts like op as it's likely to pull the wire from the terminals Don't know how these were installed or handled but I'd say instantly is a possibility depending on handling I myself have a card aswell and have been as gentle as possible with that thing with the assumption that the cable header is delicate and I have been fine up until now Nvidia needs to change the spec to have more slack or robust housing at the terminals to make these more user friendly but people calling for a lawsuit are just silly
My opinion They gave him a new founders edition free plus some goodies and a prepaid box to get this card shipped to them But now under a NDA
Even if it did temporarily That's really dangerous If undervolting software was resetted to default due to update or any other reason that will put you in dangerous situation Personally I wouldn't risk my pc and entire home to be burned for stupid principle engineering mistake they keep denying it
Idiots The consumers are still buying them in droves so who is the actual idiot
This fuckin guy A few DOZEN You have seen what 24 36 or 48 people with this problem GTFO

It was discussed in the past when PCIe 5 0 was just a rumor that they tried making PCIe 5 0 a slot that can output 300W instead of the current maximum 75W However the plan fell through because of the excessive heat this would put on the motherboard x200B Literally heats everything on the motherboard up and now imagine a limit scenario A 300W PCIe device yes It constantly sips 290 300W for 8 hours How much unnecessary heat gets pushed to random components on the motherboard A lot
Unfortunately that s not a comparable card to a 4090 in terms of performance
How would you rate it Currently thinking of getting it or 3080 Ti
Seems like you're mad you paid scalper prices for the 3090
Keep huffing that copium
Never heard of it happening
I have the same card too Had it for a week Pulls 445w had a few long seasons as well Looks like user error to me Looks like all the weight of the 4 cables and the angle may have caused the issue also may not have been seated properly I was very careful to insert it very straight into the socket and not one side first Might also be the psu I have a 1200w plat but I m also using the 4 cable adapter But I very carefully bent them straight down under the card started the bend as far away from the plug as possible Hopefully it s user error because I don t want to deal with that ever
It is a new pcie standard it's not some nvidia exclusive connector If you want to find any burned pcie connector just type that in google and look at the horror
Nvidia did not invent the 16pin pcie 5 0 power cable
It's much more basic than that There's no communication back and forth just 2 pins for presence detection of the connector adapter and 1 pin that indicates 450W capability and 1 pin that indicates 600W capability It was designed for backwards compatibility through the adapter
Provided it doesn't end up damaging the card or your computer in the process
If you ever do do this definitely make a YouTube video
This is stupid
He is using an ATX 3 0 PSU without an adapter How is this helpful for the current cases
Here is the thing though Cables in DIY PCs are often heavily abused They should be designed with this in mind The old 8 Pins can take crazy bending PCBs are usually hardened to withstand some level of dropping and smashing unscathed This adaptor on the other hand is designed with requiring care in how it's being used That's just no bueno for the DIY market
My dude have you never cable managed a pc before Literally one of the first things when cable managing gpu power cables is making a 180 harsh bend backwards to get the cables out of the way and through the chassis holes Making a power connector that will fail catastrophically in the use case of 90 of pc builders is an epic fail I lucked out to grab an evga 3070 last year Normal 8 pin connectors and the last gen of THE best add in partner there ever was Rip
He is not using the adapter
Bad link
Unless they can monitor the current through each individual wire I doubt it a bad connection only adds a bit of voltage drop that can very well be outside the precision of the conection sensor
The sense pins are really really dumb They are constantly either on or off to denote if there is something plugged in They can't send information
It's burnt at the card connection Being under powered potentially had 0 to do with the issue Not how that works for where the connection was
you are reading that article incorrectly a single PCIe cable with a splitter on the end is not the same as the dual ended cables supplied with your PSU they are designed to be able to handle the full spec 150w from both connectors Infact the new 12vhpwr cable from Corsair only uses two PCIe connectors on the PSU side This had nothing to do with the cables anyway if it did they would have melted not the 12vhpwr connector
The connector itself is rated for 600W the GPU can use with external voltage controllers and max TDP figures up to 600W The PCIe connector is also supplying 75W which means the PCIe connector will never effectively be at 600W worst case But for the TDP to be reached you need external voltage controllers check this video from der8auer and he doesn't seem to have added one Which means GPU probably stopped at 450 500ish watts
I bet 100 cookies OP hasn't followed an operating guide on how to bend the connector 4 5cm from the card and not crush the connector Evidence shown in this video clearly shows that's not the case v kRkjUtH4nIE Direct link to setup photo
Doesn't get more slackier than vertically mounting utm source share utm medium web2x context 3
If his cable had too much bend in it then you can't bend these things at all apparently
Tbh Jayz2cent is the last person I'd trust to do analysis on this Dude has a long history of big mouthing then walking back with stupid explanation
as cablemod put it don't bend them vertically or horizontally
They should abandon these weird ass sockets and just start shipping GPUs with three pin plugs to directly connect to wall outlets
The 8 pin connectors actually have a similar rating Don t listen to that jayz2cent clown His videos are for click bait He doesn t care about informing his viewership It s all about the clicks
It is false information Source hardwareunboxed 4090 review
Watched a jays2cent video That's like saying I asked my bus driver this morning
Casual racism isn't okay just because you have a valid point on the original assertion
Metal housing on a power connector No
Why do they supply an adapter then I'd prefer if they didn't mislead people if it's that dangerous to use most can probably afford a new PSU when buying a 1600 graphics card anyway
4090 is a PCIe Gen4 card with the same'ish consumption as the 3090ti
Except thats 100 false Every 4090 comes with an adaptor
Not really Seasonic PSU's are single rail and they're one of the best ones out there You're confusing it with overcurrent protections or overpower protection short circuit protection Any of these that should prevent a cable from using too much power Numbers are nice but it's the actual implementation that matters Also wr have no idea how OP hooked it up
If the problem was the power rail it would be the power supply that failed Unless the rail wasn't rated for the wattage then the failure mode would be a brown out undervoltage of components not a burnt connector The only thing that causes wires and connectors to burn out is more current than they're rated for or potentially not being seated properly If Nvidia know how much power their GPU consumes under max load then they know how much current is going through the connector and the connector should be adequately oversized to allow 10 or 20 more current than their rated max load Having that large margin of error would also likely resolve any issues caused by mis seated connectors as with the larger connectors even mis seated would have larger contact points and therefore be able to handle more current without heating up enough to melt the housing This is entirely a bad design decision by Nvidia and in no way the fault of the PC builder
rail had nothing to do with it
Has nothing to do with the but there's no other option
i use 4 seperate cables
I dont know why i am being downvoted Everyone needs to understand that you cannot daisy chain 8pin power cables the gpu will then be asking for more than 150watt through 1 cable Even if OP is not doing it it absolutely is important to NOT do this as it will of course melt stuff
He tried getting past the loading screen in cyberpunk
OC isn't the issue The issue is bending the cable any bending
worth GPUs alone costing 3x the price of the best console at this point yeah I get why people are temped to switch over
why even comment
Consoles cant do 4K 120 fps with maxed settings
Ur comparing gpus with a console Bruh consoles are nothing like gpus
Great idea to be handicap in every possible scenario Every
Why are you here Go back to your console pesant
It's not unknowable magic to think a 600w cable that nvidia themselves says don't bend too much that has smaller pins cables and is more fragile than the cable that delivered 150w is what any reasonable person might call fucking stupid
You are completely out of touch These cables have clear design flaws and are bound to fail
Touch grass
Nonsensical reply An underpowered PSU isn't going to cause a connector to burn the most likely thing it will cause is your system suddenly powering off due to the PSU triggering over current protection although some faulty PSUs may have insufficient protections and fry themselves potentially dumping a lot more voltage into the system than they're supposed to That isn't what happened here The PSU is fine The card is fine outside the singed port What happened was that the connector was somehow damaged increasing the resistance of the high current connection More resistance means more heat and more heat further increases the resistance creating a thermal runaway event that leads to the connector melting itself Again the wattage of the PSU has absolutely no influence on this only the properties of the connector
Cable is rated for 600 watts
Was machen hier denn Deutsche das ist doch unerh mir ist gestern die Bude abgebrannt wegen dem Adapter
If it includes an adapter you should be able to use it
Why are they selling them with adapters that cant handle the heat in the first place
in the rest of the world this is an over 2k gpu lol
Alright I have 2 questions What PSU do you recommend Why would my current rm850x not be good enough with its original cables and the adapter supplied with the card
That wouldn't solve the issue as the 12VHPWR cables on the ATX 3 0 PSUs have the same layout and suffer from the same limitations as this adapter
hey here v HAZWwwHScaQ is a very basic intro level video about why the connector itself is an issue if you want to know more the zoid link posted by the foo above is even more technical
People use it because the card provide it If you should not use it don't provide it
They are just to brag about having a gpu that will be cheaper and obsolete in about a year
You have literally no fucking clue what you're talking about
I dont think you understand the problem
Or don't buy 4090
Why would that matter Cable still failed regardless
I have two 4090's and they both work perfectly Works fine for me so it must work fine for everyone else
Uh this is a fundamental problem in the adapter specifically when bent and not a PSU issue In other words it gobsmacks me that this wasn't even noticed before this damn card was released
it is not brain rocketry my friend High resistance high heat melted down connector unusually high heat at the connector basically the pins weren't contacting properly causing the high heat thus the meltdown I don't know the reason for the poor contact in op's case but in general it is usually due to oxidation not likely because card and cable are new or vibration movement looking at the connector size it seems like a terrible idea passing 450w 38amps at 12v through it
It s not the power supply
I'm in doubt because the connector is tiny Not sure it can handle the ampere
Why is it deserved What kind of salty comment is that
Which will void the
Quick fix
You think this is a fucking contest of who got it the worst or something Enjoy the negative karma weirdo
I think NVIDIA has asked OP to not share any other information while this is being researched by NVIDIA tbh
it was a corsair rx1000W
How so
1000w for a 4090 is fine A 1200w though would be better I agree These new adapters make cable management shit though I see there s no bend in that one in the pic you supplied but that looks horrible
very true issue is if you mount horizontal literally no case will be able to accept it with the side panel
Most people would put the card in a tower case with the cable hanging sideways where it will bend slightly The pic you linked shows the card in a riser which is not a standard setup They obviously messed up the design and will be trying to keep this quite for as along as possible
Just because it's tested doesn't mean user error wouldnt fuck it Samsung tested the galaxy fold 1 200k something times no problem a week in someone's hand and its already creaky
I think it s the card brands adapter so likely any adapters that come with the card are bunk Someone said they re using an aftermarket cable and have had no melty plugs
Might be a high enough watt but thats clearly the end to the adapter cable that came with the 4090 Anyone who bought a 4090 knowing it was going from a single end and splitting into 4 different cables going to the PSU and STILL didnt buy an atx 3 0 complient PSU is seriously slacking in priorities If youre going to buy a GPU this expensive and powerful you REALLY shouldnt cheap out on buying a PSU
It's a stupid connector Your typical 16awg 8 pin cable is extremely overbuilt and safe whilst this is a dumb lazy decision on Nvidia's part to cut costs and board dimensions Just watch the buildzoid video it goes into actual good detail
Cope harder jensen
Something that is designed to be installed by non experts and costs as much as this should not have such a massive possibly dangerous design flaw
Could be if you look at the blurry case in the background the plug side of the GPU is close to what would be the glass panel Although also looks like there might be a vertical GPU bracket which would help it not bend
The PSU required is IMO quite a bit of bullshit sure you won't power a 250 watt card with a 200 watt PSU but a generic PSU wattage doesn't say how many watt you can get through the different 12v lines Source spent time some years ago getting a PSU powering my 3D printer and then GPUs in my and my kids PC
JazyTwoCents v HAZWwwHScaQ says you should be fine with a 3 0 since they are load balancing each of the pins Just don't bend the connector too much
Sounds like it's the adapter itself from what I've been reading the corsair adapter has better build quality compared to the garbage one nvidia put out Or play it sage and get an atx 3 psu
oh not not at all nothing overblown here except amateurish power connector standard nVidia's poor wish for dominance by any price paid people who had touch with for example MSI R9 390X would know what means a LOT of AMPs through bad cables poor PSU connectors x200B these things simply dont work that way electronics which consume a LOT of AMPs tend to produce a lot of heat which in case of this stupid nvidia product overheat everything around it draws even more and more power final effect over time is that the weakest point will fail cable connector both x200B previously mentioned MSI R9 390X in my case managed to make that effect on ThermalTake Toughpower 1350W PSU by burning melting connectors at PSU side and it was dramatically lower AMPs than nVidia brick in question so people who are not electro technicians and didnt go to school for electrical science can only be amazed shocked but when i first saw this rarely stupid connector i said it's gonna melt and was right ofc and it's not about cables it's about poor connectors itself my first thought about it and 450 Watts was this will need new type of connector with at least double the connecting surface on connector pins and much wider diameters of pins itelf mr leather jacket pushed PCIe alliance to standardize this crap connector x200B happy meal mr leather jacket you need totally new connector type and a pair of good electro techincal engineers in the future
The issue is the adapter from nvidia's 3rd party manufacturer if you have a new ATX 3 0 PSU and can use 1 native 12VHPWR cable to plug into your 4090 like I did there are no problems If you have a 2nd gen PSU like most then just do not use the adapter that's provided with your 4090 You need to purchase a different better one until this is all sorted out
This one was never locked
What pc case are you using
I would be confident too if people were stupid enough to be paying me 2000USD for a potential house fire
Yes Paying 2K for a GPU is not enough for the company to have a proper cable right

Rays of tracing go brrrrrrrr
The RTX 4080 uses the same cable which means Its still prone to failure if bent wrong However it draws less power reportedly even less than the RTX 3080 in some cases meaning even if Its bent badly and forcing more power through fewer pins it could melt but has a much lower chance to because it might not be enough power to melt the cable and or adapter x200B The RTX 4080 is less likely to melt than the RTX 4090 but still more likely than any other recent GPU series because Nvidia thought this terrible cable was a good idea
thanks Steve
Imagining the thumbnail for maximum drama lol
We've reached to Nvidia and they told us there was nothing to worry about Fire hazard is normal for GPU that can also be used as a BBQ or space heater Next
Thanks Steve
The video you mentioned 'm really curious if this is the cause for OP Edit OP has a Corsair rmx1000 PSU which is atx2 4 not 3 0 so that is criteria number 1 Next would be what kind of adapter they have and how they plugged it in
Not our fault Learn to plug in ur cables RMA Dept Yeah f uck You Warranty Dept
clearly it's water damage rma denied
i bet it will be more fragile connecter that needs the cable to not be bent cards soo big the cable HAS to be bent to even fit in a case unless you want to run without a sidepanel that's an option not a good one but still
Yeah Nah just stock clocks Would've bought non oc model if it were available at the time My rtx 3080 was tuf 3080 non oc model and had zero issues I prefer stability over few gains
I would argue having a melted GPU power connector on a 1 800 card is probably a lot worse
Fractal Ion 2 platinum 860w
Asus website and reseller website said recommended 850w I have fractal ion 2 platinum 860w And case is fractal torrent has plenty of space and airflow Used different pcie cables with the adapter like stated on the instructions Was waiting for atx 3 0 pcie 5 psu's but there aren't much of those Shame that I just sold my Asus rtx 3080 yesterday
Thanks for posting Good information x200B Still haven't received a reply from the retailer about the rma Sent them many messages asking were we stand with the case Won't be using them ever again x200B Nvidia has been kind and they have been trying to help me They promised to contact Asus directly x200B Have been refreshing every site on daily basis for the last month for pcie 5 psu's but there isn't any available Today I also send message directly to Fsp Trying to ask if I can get one their psu's somehow Waiting for an answer
who cares about the bent you need to bend your cables to build a pc it is a must it is that or use multiple 90 connectors and the weak point are the connectors not the cables so the more the worse
So instead of solving the problem and returning the GPU or stopping using it until it is cleared up will you just push it away from yourself or limit the performance so that it doesn't occur The perfect customer
It's the one from Asus
It's clearly the included adapter
From the pictures I've seen I wouldn't call it bent horribly more of a normal bend to the side and rear of the card The connector is shit designed too much current per pin
You're kidding calling this a horrid bend right If not that's freaking absurd That's barely a kink I see the sharper bend you're talking about but seriously that's how some modular cables come wrapped some pre built PC's are even worse than that I really don't think the bend has anything to do with it If anything I'd be more suspect about the weight of those cables bending on the two connectors than the cable itself Edit If anyone coming across this hasn't seen but somehow happens to come across this the issue was found So the wires are just soldered on to a thin pad that's bridged across into a pair of power rails No wonder they're failing The solder blob pad can just detach under handling and form a resistive heating contact point that burns the entire adapter up
How exactly is that a horrible bend What is horrible is nvidia designing an adapter that can't even handle a slight bend like that meanwhile I've built small form factor PC's that had their 8 pins bent way worse than that function without problems
My dick bends harder than that
My 8 pins on my gpu have been bent more than that for 3 years now Does that mean the new smaller connector is inferior Or was this just a case of a bad connector slipping through QA
out of curiosity how could op have set things up differently to avoid the flex im really bad at spatial thinking and struggling to see how it could be changed but im saving up for one of these lol
bend horribly you okay bro op bend is as smooth as posible nothing horribly a out
Are you an idiot That's not bent horribly right Besides the whole reason cables are cables is because they are SUPPOSED to be able to bend If they weren't designed to be bent they'd be busbars not
There is nothing whatsoever in the spec that relates to bending of adapter cables or bending of cables at all as far as I can see You are referring to third party research by cablemod
How the hell is 90 bent horribly Its an incredibly minor bend Its not plastic
There is no way to not bend this damn cable with card being so huge I think that just need to thrown out It s nearly impossible with the way the connect gets are and how huge these cards are
So bending the cables now is improper Sounds like shit cable to me
Is it safe to say I should wait for the next gen PSU's

sorry about the long lead time we are working without weekend to catch up as fast as we can
How is that even related We are working full speed on all orders
yes our Global Store ships worldwide
that was the setup
that's a lot less of a bend on the cables than I was expecting to see
Looks completely fine to me I would report this to any safety official in your country and RMA this
Unfortunately it might have been because it was a horizontal bend see But what PSU did you have any split cables going into the adaptor
So much sag
Christ even mounted vertically just look at the sag on that thing Fuck
Your RAM is installed in the wrong slots BTW
Is your card at a slope on this image Was it seated properly I ask cause I have the same case and my card is vertically mounted too but it s not on a slope like that
Lol that sag
My guess looking at your photos is that these connectors don't like lateral moment of force you might have had a faulty connector You can see that the burned up pins are the 12v pins on both extreme sides of the connector It looks like if the bent was upwards or downwards like it is when mounted horizontally this might have not happened In any case it sucks that's for
Whys it filled with piss though
Looking at your setup I think your setup created an airflow dead spot where the connector is causing heat to build up and yeah because it's a shit connector design it overheated and melted Most conventional cases have fans blowing across the length of the card so fresh air flow will hit the side of the connector cooling it down Also the vertical orientation means the heat from the card pcb will move to the top edge of the card where the connector sits I think with this connector design people need to be more conscience of airflow over the connector
The cables are too blurry out of focus in that pic would be nice if you could disable as many LED's and re take with the Flash enabled on your camera
Or we could also agree that trying to miniaturize the power connector carrying potentially upwards of 600W was a dumb
Why is this comment downvoted This is probably the case poor contact leading to high resistance on the connector is a perfect explanation of what happened It doesn't mean the connector doesn't suck
100 my guess also Looks like it was smashed down by the case window's glass
I mean it s literally burnt down so smoke is obvious
Continuous Cablemod product vs 4 pronged power adapter that came with OP's GPU Different things with different needs The OP should not be expected to read Cablemod's guidance on a product he is not even using But you knew that already

Corrected for you guys Not everyone is military around here
Dutch is going to be upset
Did it still work when it was currently connected And you happened to notice it by accident when taking out the plug Or did the gfx card just shut down mid game
WHAT WAS YOU DOIN O LAWD
Well that was your problem I'm not sure if these cables are rated for playing demanding games I max out my 4090 with Dead Cells and the original Doom for fear of this happening GL thanks for posting BTW this post hit wcctech may blow up
are you running a separate cable from the power supply to each of the four Molex or are you running only 2 cables to the power supply with 2 plugged into each
It burned at leas than 100W draw per cable since PCIe provides some power as well Nvidia engineering at it's finest
3090tis are like 700 bucks now Its hard to justify the 4000 series
You lost
stinky miner
Oh dear Gigashite strikes again
No it happened few days ago and i already sent it back to my retailer in Belgium I posted here because i saw this post on another website The GPU was burned on the connector and adapter dead too the cable was not even bend First time i have a problem like that and I own every high end GPU from Nvidia since 10 years still have 690 780 780 ti lightning from msi who was never released 980 ti 1080 ti 2080 ti 3090 3090 ti
I used the GPU at stock and tested it multiple times at low power with 50 to 100 power limit When the gpu died it was at 100 power limit I was playing testing a game that is not released yet It's a very bad idea to oc this GPU if even on stock this kind of things can happen d
Why make a useless comment that smells of jealousy disdain and malice
They have an adapter to two pcie 8 pins that came with my new 1300W Prime TX Titanium Direct ones will be a bit still from what I read
I used the adapter from gigabyte 4 8pin to 12pin Yes i heard of it I will ask seasonic if they can send me one for the next 4090
Johnnyguru was responding to GamersNexus Steves comments on the matter
That's cuz he is kind of a dumbass
We have no idea what this person's configuration was They could have had this coming depending on the bend psu wattage psu rating psu type which aib card they use Did they overclock Either way this sub is warranted in thinking Jay is a idiot
Wow It's really pathetic you're stalking my comments from a month ago lol Yikes Jay is parroting Igor's Lab 't really come to any conclusions on his own much like usual
That's with any cable actually just to clarify not just our own offering
I had this happen on a Modular psu years ago I did not notice a piece of hair got between the connectors
How does metal have a lower melting point than plastic
Your normal old plug with 3000W would have no more than 15 30A This is up to 50A
yep if it was a fire hazard there would be hundreds of posts everyday about burnt connectors Well am looking forward to good lab test review about this matter So far this post is being spammed on various sites
by not forking out cash for something so stupidly power hungry That's honestly more to do with bad design than power hungry
That seems to be the way everyone is going Saw the other day that the latest Intel chip can pull 250w by itself AMD isn't any better
I did One of the perk of work was to play all the pinball I wanted to after fixing them to test them D
The power delivery issues of last gen were talked about again when New World started bricking cards
Well this guy 'did it' clown face 4090ti
It s already the new PCIe spec so you already lost
The 3090 Ti does
A2 CC8766 C089 430 A 8 CAB C34 EC1479 DE F2 BAAF63 7141 4090 8 C28 58 FFE016 E9 E Rip smiling face with tear
Cant they just used 4 regular connectors directly into the GPU Today on Questions not asked by Nvidia's development team
The adapter has a chip inside that tells the GPU how much power it can draw You can run a 4090 off of one PCIe connector if you really wanted
You can do it for things like rendering or ML but not games
Its all relative I recently bought an RTX 3070 on ebay for 350 and it was probably the best PC upgrade I've ever had The RTX 3070 is vastly superior to the GTX 1080 I have been using and I paid 600 for that 1080 in 2017 I would recommend this upgrade any day of the week Absolutely worth every penny
This sounds like BMW
Sell new shit
So it's not even happening at overclock setting Just in normal mode
This isn't really the best way to put things x200B It's well known that the 12 pin connector is sensitive to strain so in some cases if it's tugged on a little bit due to the new cards being so large it's likely the contacts won't be as solid and can burn x200B This was a known issue and reported before the 4000 series even came out and while in MOST situations things should be fine it's not really easy just to say user error x200B The other issue with that statement is that user error shouldn't be something that is so easy to cause x200B Edit for some reason I hit escape and it posted the comment before I was done lol
Hopefully that is all it is No one wants those kinds of problems
How easy is it to do this user error and how often will other users do this error I'm not disagreeing it doesn't look like the cable itself failed but the plug still stuff should be built in such a way that common user errors don't cause fires
My guess exactly
960 Thats after my 750ti innit
That was my thought as well Everyone who got a 4090 put different loads on it and even in cases where the card sucked well over 500W it didn't burn up or melt
ATX Version 3 0 Multi Rail Desktop Platform Power Supply specs from Intel page 19 the new 600W 12VHPWR cable plug introduced with PCIe Gen 5 0 detailed in Section 5 2 2 4 3 requires 16 AWG wire and a per pin current capacity of 9 2 A The specs for 12VHPWR start at page 52 section 5 2 2 4 3 Table on page 26 covers the three types of PCIe connectors 12VHPWR Connector 55 Amps RMS Maximum of root mean square RMS of current in any continuous 1 second interval
Yes I have that option But will look ugly and hence avoided Till I came across this thread that got me thinking
Thank you for the mention of our adapter 3
An adaptor is unfortunately just another point of failure The main issue it seems is pushing that much amp and wattage through extremely tiny pins
Matt I don't think even the 90 degree adapter would help as my cable entry points on the cabinet are to the right of the power connector of the GPU The right angled adapter may even do more harm as it will make the cables bend to the clearance between the adapter and the motherboard Right now I have reduced the horizontal bend somewhat as shown in the picture below Imgur The option that would help is the extension cable as below What's your feedback CableMod Pro ModFlex 12VHPWR PCI e Cable Extension 16 pin to four 8 pin
That's the default one that came with Asus strix A basic one and not very confidence inspiring
Who's the other reddit user People keep saying there's a second person but not even the youtube videos are mentioning a name Edit It's this person
That's 2 more reddit users than I consider acceptable all within a month of release
The fuck does an AMD card have to do with this This is also the second comment I've seen from you saying the same thing Are you really going full stan for a video card
The new amd gpus will launch soon in November
Sounds about right to me D
You mean to tell me that they want you to plug four 8 pins to this single adapter That seems like it s asking for trouble
No Intel just included it in the ATX 3 0 standard The connector was developed repurposed a 12pin Molex microfit connector and pushed by nVidia Essentially they took out all safety headroom and old 8pin could technically carry up to 612W bevor melting but was rated for just 150W The VHPWR connector can carry technically 648W bevor getting hot I mean Molex rated MicroFit to 5A with max peak of 8 5A per pin and nVidia rated the 12VHPWR pins to 9 5A when submitting it to ATX3 0
the correct cable will have the exact same issue the terminals in the video card side are way way to small
A 'm waiting for the ATX3 0 to install my 4090
Yes warranty So you buy a 1600 GPU it melts and then you get to sit and wait for the manufacturer to send you a new one It's still a pain in the ass
Will warranty even cover this Aren't they gonna say you probably bent the cable too hard it's your fault or something
4k or Vr headsets
You ever played 4k on max settings 4090 is practically the first card to go over 90fps on modern games at 4k cranked settings Do not project anything on others that get things you want
4k High refresh rate Stop being ignorant
Enthusiasts People with 1090 s Certain workstation applications VR
Yeah makes sense that's exactly what I play on but I do want to upgrade to dual 4k monitor setup to replace the current dual's 1440p's Also for VR purposes i'm pretty sure i'm ok for now but the 6700k is showing its age Might try to hold off on a couple more years though even though I really wanted the current stuff that is out and was planning around that as a build
Mate I've looked You can't buy ATX12VO psus with the connector Only cables that convert from the old pci standard
Cablemod 12VHPWR cable actually requires more clearance than the stock adapter The right angle adapter doesn t fit on this card according to its current published spec but they said they re working on one that will fit more cards on the market
NVIDIA not doing dumb shit is the only acceptable answer to this problem
You're not buying a tidy car for 1600 mate
I'm afraid a lot of manufacturers will blame the customer and not honor it
i cant wait for when we see amd use these same 12vhpwr plugs too
Zen 4 CPUs launched at the same MSRP as Zen 3 The motherboard and ram are overpriced not the CPUs
Makes me wonder if they ll issue a revision with larger gauge cable
The connector is not nVidia's design nVidia just decided to use that shitty thing
time to get inventive
Seems there are 3 cases in this thread itself Look at the comments
Nah it's the wattage that heats the cables V A Not just amps So the card will still draw as much heat generating current otherwise we would be able to use single copper strands as long as we applied 10 000V
The cables used are fine here They are rated to handle that current It needs a plug that can form solid strong connections Solved by the industry decades ago But they reinvent the wheel to save money
I smell class action
yes that will be better
It is a poor design when your design interferes with all known cable management practices and makes it impossible to have a case door In order to follow the guidelines you would have to have an open air rig
Yes an improper connection caused by a bad connector on the adapter or the card or user error by not correctly plugging in even without the adapter could have been ended in the same way
It actually can matter because in some case's depending on the ATX 2 0 PSU it can cause fires JayztwoCentz did a video about it about four weeks ago
I honestly don't even know I don't I'm just saying to OP do NOT mention which PSU they're using when sending off for RMA Personally I'd just say I'm using an ATX 3 0 PSU I've seen too many denied RMA's to just volunteer information They could start denying people with ATX 2 0 PSU's or something You never know
The sense pins only work with a ATX 3 0 PSU
No they ve been worse boards themselves arcing and catching fire
If there is a problem and I say if because the RTX 3090 Ti didn't reveal any issue it's in the quality of the connection between connector on the cable and the one on the card Adapter or not doesn't change anything about that
You re right but as per Nvidia themselves The fourth pin only draws power if OCd to 600W Otherwise three pins will suffice for the stock 450W TDP Edit so if power draw is limited at 450W you would never face this melting issue Power is directly proportional to energy and in this case heat
Does the ATX 3 0 PSU help mitigate the cable melting problem
The 3090 is actually a mm wider than a 4090 FE
Its hard to say if its because of the installation or not In mine i bent the molex cables first and then made sure they kind of looked straight before i plugged them into the GPU But theres still a bend my card is 140mm cabinet has 167mm clearance The plastic part keeps them kind of straight though I looked up the Gamer's Nexus video and it seems like if theres an issue it would show up within 10 20 hours Iam assuming this is 10 20 hours under peak load So depending on your usage you'd probably find out in a week or so I would have used mine for arnd 10 hrs or so under load If i have an issue id be posting here next week
Most likely yes This is what manufacturers do for checks before the card goes to someone else
when you put 450W component near your PC Motherboard you can already expect melting M2 disk MoBo southbridge failure of overheating and rest of the pc components to work under stress because of extreme heat produced no matter how big your PC case is no matter if you use AIO watercooling and how much fans you have in it such products are a no brainer imho made just for showing off i wanna see up to 200w product that gives 200fps in cyberpunk on 1080p that would be something not this nuclear melting plant in small space
The consumers duh
Well not quite 2 times as fast It's about 85 faster than my 3090 Aorus Master when I benchmarked both with the new dx12 drivers
I paid for the card what was required And I could easily pay for a 4090 But I dont want my room to be an oven Im probably going to jump ship to AMD if they offer better performance per watt
It's so obvious too lol ya love to see it
Lol bragging about spending 1600 usd on gpu that will be worth 1k usd in 1 year
You clearly haven t been in the PC gaming space long 3080s 3090s 2080Tis 1080s 1070s 1060s have all had issues with ICs combusting things happening with fires etc
They can't even send information They might as well be a jumper pin
Non sense
Exactly this would happen due to arcing which would mean a loose connection
Happened to a friend of mine's rtx 3090 as well because he was reckless not to connect more cables It's not about being underpowered it's about the fact the card wants more power the PSU provides it the two cables can't provide more power than their quality and or their watts rating can handle burned connector If you pull more Watts than a single cable can provide you end up with the above pic It's absolutely MANDATORY to connect a 4090 with minimum 3 cables approx 864 Watts to be safe
Where's the cookies You
I would like to thank Nvidia for providing me with material for low effort content Absolute chad
Video is random bullshit money grabb on how the cables are attached to its metallic guidies PCI SIG are the only ones that can shine light about this tuntil they give us official news take everything with tweezers Setup photo is a bit blurry on the cable side Cant clearly see how many pcie x8 is he using with the adaptor may have burned out the controller chip in the connector Cheers
Send power through wifi to them lol
These sockets are for the new ATX 3 0 PSUs that come out early next year It's a good move but poorly executed
I don t get it Is Steve Chinese
Wait until you hear about ground connections it'll blow your mind
I believe they thought they can make more money if people were thinking they could use their old ps If you have to pay 1600 for a new card then and get another power supply chances you won t get the new card Nvidia needs to own this and stop including adapters that could cause fires and also include a warning not to use any adapters period
Whether you think it is false or you think it is true you are probably right People take what they believe for truth Use your adapter and make sure you have a smoke detector connected to the side of your case
Put thine foolish ambitions to rest
Dlss is just 1080p too p
You are already that little kid
Definitely the shittiest cables on a unit of a graphics card They knew the cables will have to be bent still they made them tough to bend with this terrible design
Can confirm My 3080ti has draw spikes well in excess of what the specs list Went north of 1200 for my PSU to prevent the occasional abrupt system crash when the card would draw hard People just don t understand electricity which shouldn t surprise me
The PSU is NOT fine according to Corsairs OWN recommendations lol 600W load requires a 1200W rated CORSAIR PSU or higher 450W load requires 1000W or higher 300W load requires 750W or higher
Yes correct But read my statements again 600W of power draw recommends a 1200W power supply OP had a 1000W PSU
I agree Nvidia shouldn't have provided it Should be required to buy a PSU with a complient port if theres new tech that needs said port I am not saying Nvidia is at no fault but idc what it shipped with Anybody should be able to look at thay adapter and know its a bad idea to put in their rig I feel bad dudes port got fried but man was it not expected Drawing that much power through an adapter like that screams a fire waiting to happen Plus didnt a ton of people warn this would happen before the cards even released to the public
Lol it won't be obsolete for many many years
Nvidia can't potentially be at fault and have delivered a faulty product
It doesn t mean it must work perfectly for everyone else It means it s likely to work perfectly for everyone who has the appropriate setup and read what NVIDIA said themselves about straining the connection
It was noticed before the card was released PCISig and other sub tiers noted that they would burn if bent even slightly and Nvidia decided to do nothing about it increase length of shielding harden wires to prevent bending including a DO NOT BEND FOR FIRST 35mm sticker on their wires literally anything
It was noticed That's why NVIDIA stated that in their testing they did not experience failure when the adapter was not bent They have acknowledged it can cause problems if its bent
The reason for the poor contact is the way the cable was bent Causing undue stress on the connectors lol
Brokie comment tbh
quicker than 2 months for warranty
It was a joke and you re over here crying like a newborn grow up
I do enjoy it I rub it all over my i7 10700k as thermal paste Get the fuck outa here like I care about karma Meanwhile I'll upvote your comment because one day you can cash them in for a shiney new nothing
Obviously used an incompatible PSU
Bruh that s hilarious haha How could they not forsee this
No that's not true The OP had his mounted vertically and still had the issue It's USER ERROR
LOL The design is fine The reality is most people don't know what they're doing when it comes to computers Anyone who tries to put a 3 5 slot card in standard mounting doesn't know what they're doing
Exactly if you didn't get ATX 3 0 PSU then this was bound to happen Websites may say that you only need a higher wattage PSU like 1200 or more and for it to be gold or platinum but realistically it's still going to destroy your 4000 series card
It's both a design flaw and not a design flaw The real design flaw here is the irresponsibly of making a 450 600W card when it could have been 350W for 3 less performance You're asking for the full power capability of this connector which works well when not bent But the massive power requirement has caused the coolers to be massive in size thus not fitting in cases thus being bent All connectors are dangerous when the designed connection contact area is not used
It s not he posted a pic of the gpu vertically mounted it s a shitty design that really needs changing as even massive cases can t mount these ideally with horizontal mounts
Yep thanks for pointing out was 100 bent irresponsibly Unless OP wants to actually clear that up that's what I'm sticking with Looking for sympathy but only replying to the comments that give him such and not those asking how
Well like I said I've got the 4090 founders edition and got probably 25 hours on it already and I have absolutely no problems like this my connectors are fine Most likely though it's the way he hooked up his power supply to it Each one of those connector should have its own line going to the power supply He could have just hooked up two on one line on both of them
Please share what make model power supply PSU you used
It's a Corsair 678C
Especially since 90 or more of the market for the 3090 4090 is just people who want to flex that they own one while they play super low requirement games like CSGO and have zero need for it Not surprising that the same people are dumb enough to waste 2K on a card its a bragging right Even though most of the time when I year I own a XX90 I just hear I'm wasting this card's potential and bought the one with the highest number cuz I thought it sounded fancy
Nvidia is just a small humble indie company Don't be so rude jeez
You re welcome Steve
Ooowww my knees
I guess that's what we deserve for buying bottom of the barrel cheap gpus
this is the way
In the Nvidia Control panel click Help Debug Mode this will remove any manufacturer overclock
Yeah can't argue with that 3080 sold yesterday very bad timing Still had 1070ti in storage so at least I am able to use the computer
How were the cables bent Upwards Downwards Sidewards At the adapter or further away from it Specifics would help narrow it down to keep track of for future users
Plus they should take in account temp in a closed system with less the perfect venting so the starting point temp might be higher anyway then this stupidity regarding bending c'mon honestly what do they expect that people have open PC benches like 99 instead of PC cases Let's see how this going to fry in something cramped like Alienware R13 for example or whatever they going to call it next Thanks for the info
And to be clear this card wasn't bought directly from the manufacturer x200B In my country retailers are the first contact point for RMAs Then any extended warranty period can be provided by the manufacturer directly
I already bought a 12VHPWR extra direct cable 2x8pin to 12VHPWR its on the way I think it is Corsair's not sure however my PSU is Leadex Special Edition 1000W GOLD hopefully the cable will work I see other brands like be quiet and some unfamiliar to me also offering the same NIGHTMARE cable however Leadex still doesn't have it as an extra or a proper 3 0 5 0 PCI PSU so I have no choice The only doubt I have is this 2x8 to 12VHPWR while the provided msi adapter is 4x8 to 12VHPWR I guess will see once I'm going to install it Good luck to you hopefully your issue will be resolved ASAP Cheers
I would do some research on the cables for the 4090 and why it's an issue
I'm going to get the cable that fixes the issue Oct 31 There is nothing else that will fix it This is the new standard Better cable or adapter Power limit to 60 gets you 95 of the 'm doing this anyway I'd return it but the founders edition is nothing something you can walk in and grab Everyday tech is out it depreciates I'm not buying the new generation if it's 3 months later for a new cable when I can buy one next week Only a few will have this issue maybe 10 20 and noons of them are FEs Computers are my hobby and that's it lol rest is spend time with wife
AFAIK most the adapters provided by third parties are the same adapter that Nvidia provides for their FE
It's really no different from the adapter for the 3090ti power draw is in the same ballpark as well Though in Black Desert it was probably very low you'd hit CPU limits way before you'd hit any GPU limits even with unlimited framerate
The right cable is bent almost 90 degrees to the right That is horribly
The bend is almost certainly the direct cause of the issue here but the problem is that the connector is not designed to handle even a minor bend like this In effect the cable is perfectly fine for how it is specified to work but how it is specified to work is incompatible with reality
The bottom most cable has a pretty huge bend in it The rest look fine though
It's not horrid but if the instructions for the adapter say not to do that you don't do that
This right here Ive bent psu cables over on themselves on smaller builds Nothing burns up from bending it Only from improper design or shit materials
By buying a wider computer case or waiting for 90 degree angled 3rd party cables
It's almost a 90 degree bend on the far right cable
I didn't say bent horribly right I said bent horribly right behind the connector You are not supposed to bend the cable until it's 35mm behind the base of the connector which OP did
Besides the whole reason cables are cables is because they are SUPPOSED to be able to bend All cables have design limits when it comes to bending This includes HDMI Display Port and Ethernet cabling
90 degree on something that isn't supposed to be bent at all at that point is horribly
Sorry which retailer again
Will it be simultaneously released on the EU store Because as of now there is no info about the 90 on the EU website
I recently bough the cableemos from Amazon didn t come with this cable loudly crying face It separate
Will this thing fit the Asus's kinda recessed card plug specifically the Strix 4090
Will this work for 3090Ti FE as well Or does that already exist
I have my founders edition I am afraid of using it now When you have plenty to go around on the 31st I need this asap
Because you guys seem to have time to waste on here and yet have given no emails for order updates or any kind of communication for paying customers that have been waiting weeks for shipment
Plenty of cable relief on that possibly a defect
My cable has way more bend than yours basically had to do a straight 90 bend to get my case to close cause I mounted horizontally Like the other person said you probably just got unlucky Edit
So a gigabyte 4090 huh
I dont even know what aggressive even means You can release a 2000 USD GPU and say 'dont bend it aggressively' End of the day it has to be bent and noone knows whats the right way to do it Btw how did you end up finding out the cable was burnt Iam assuming it happened when you were in game
You can see the cable is clearly bent horizontally close to the GPU connection which you're not supposed to do You cannot bend it before the 40 45mm point or issues like this can potentially happen
Your RAM should be in the second and fourth slots by the way
That's specific to their cables isn't it The distance it's safe to bend horizontally on their cable isn't necessarily the same as Nvidia's adapter After all the cable has to be allowed to bend horizontally at some point otherwise how would you plug it into a power supply If there are restrictions on where and how the default adapter can be bent it should be included in every manually and at the very least it's not in the manual for the Gaming Trio
In any case it Specially in a tight case
Oh I agree that the 12VHPWR is a stupid connector
Nahhhhhhhh that can't be it D
Same reason I'm kinda sceptical towards 240W USB C
Not true as shown in the picture Much less strain than having it mounted horizontally and squished by the side panel
100 bad guess then
No it does not
It's the exact same layout on the connector side The same rules apply
BOFA DEEZ NUTZ
Also 0 apr credit cards
How do you not pay rent as an adult Even if you live with fam that's kind of leeching
I am assuming that it will be even more expensive
Oh I know it won't be cheaper but the performance boost will be bigger and when getting second hand will make a lot of sense
if people continue on buying 4090 yeah it wont be cheaper
It means it is made by the lowest bidding contractor as cheaply as possible
We need cables Arthur
it occured mid game GPU is still working but ye i RMA it anyway
With every passing day we stray further from god's light
i only play text based rpgs with my 3060 i really dont wanna hurt it i get a solid 60 fps on youtube though
Not defending anyone but this is the PCIe 5 0 connector Nvidia brought it to the market but it's the standard one x200B Next gen AMD cards will most likely also come with this connector
If you look in the comments someone got an issue with a Asus tuf althought not as bad as op no early adopter are safe
Thanks for 's angled connectors and be careful about installation to try and minimize smell of melting plastic
I think any one here could theoritically buy a 2000 euro card if he really wants to I think most shouldnt and wouldn't because its stupid thats all
He is simple mans Gamers Nexus
Just curious why do you say this I ve been in tech for 15 years and find him to have fine knowledge and good entertainment value He may not be as technical as some of the other channels but that s not really what he s targeting but I don t normally hear him say things that are outright incorrect from recent memory
I must be out of the know on how Got any examples
that doesn mean everything he says is untrue if someone thinks that just because someone is a dumbass EVERYTHING they say is untrue then they're retarded
OP posted their setup with pics utm source share utm medium ios app utm name iossmf context 3
Why
I was referring to the insulation on the wires The wires are a lower gauge than the connector pins so the pins should have a higher thermal mass as a result You'll almost always melt the insulation on your cables before you burn out a plug After further research it seems this plug may have been installed without proper strain relief so the connector was being pulled downwards As a result the pins had less contact increased resistance at the pins and cause a thermal runaway situation that eventually started burning the plastic housing of the plug Notice the burning is at the top of the plug and the bottom is unscathed My assumption is that OP wanted to cable manage and pulled the connector cabling tight under the card to hide the cable putting that strain on the plug
Measured it it was PC at full load at 850W and a 1600W hair dryer Was around 4800W it got pretty warm yes There is no way this nvidia plug burned under normal curcumstances
How are you getting up to 50amps It's 9 amps per pin with 6 pins for 648 watts
Yeah exactly You could argue that nvidia should include a 90 Adapter and it was their fault for not doing that But the other way around if you build your own pc you should know not to just jank on a cable connector like here to pull the cable down so fucking much that the connector starts sparking So yeah
It's even more likely It's a manufacturing defect
Might be in the standard but Nvidia founders are the only cards Ive seen over the past 2 years using them And don't seem interested in the connector and so far Aib which most people seem to buy don't use them
Specs can change if they're demonstrably broken in the real world IMHO this one is Throw it out x200B We should go back to larger connectors with lower wire gauge and a 600w capable spec probably needs a minimum of 16 connectors to be really reliable and safe given heterogeneity of manufacturing asymmetric current thru different wires and of course assembly issues like stress at the connector crimp junctions
they say to give it like 35mm before starting the 's just not possible unless you've got an open air case
that asus has enough material to burn for the entire winter you will be warm for just 2000
I have the exact same setup haha I use Lian Li evo 11 and gotta run the whole day with the side panel open so the cable isn't under pressure Hope we'll fine man
It's fuggin beautiful The bend doesn't look too extreme either Your case must be massive But that's really awesome dude I'll keep fingers crossed for ya but I'd bet you're probably fine
Cant the adapter just be inside the GPU I'm not sure why we need an in between piece seems like a sloppy solution
You can run a 4090 off of one PCIe connector if you really wanted Very likely to burn something if you pull 400W through a cable connector rated for 150W
3000 GPUs in SLI
How dare you use logic It's a bad deal end of story
My 3090TI uses that plug You re wrong It depends on which vendors card you purchased
I dunno what off brand stuff you picked up but my Gigabyte Gaming OC 3090ti uses a 3 PCI E connector into one 12 pin adapter to power it My 12 pin looks immaculate on my 3090 ti I also made sure to plug in the 12 pin fully though
Imagine paying monthly for your heated seats
Yes
ops build for more context for you to decide
True I am putting it harshly calling it user error And there is a chance it is either a short on the board or this strain Being it's entirely on the top row that would indicate it's more than likely this strain issue Though this can still be looked at as user error in the sense OP should have noticed the connector being pulled down after initial install Either way the connector should have a better latching mechanism to stop this sort of thing from happening
I mean considering this is the first I've ever seen of this problem it seems pretty rare There is a chance there's a short somewhere on the board between pins 1 and 6 though which seems to be more the case the closer I look at the images So it's up in the air for me but I doubt it's power supply connector related on a large scale I'd squarely put this into the outlier category
Well yeah I'm in a completely different geographical location to OP with access only to a couple pictures of damage I haven't seen before which is weird considering the 3090 ti released in March and pulls 450 to 550 Watts using the same exact connector Considering it doesn't seem to be a widespread issue I consider this an outlier and therefore more than likely user error and a poorly seated connector
You guys are using GPU s
Amateurs I'm still playing on a R9 270
Bro you got 750 A Ti at that I thought I was fancy with my performance series GTX 275
That makes sense The issues with the limits were corrected in 3 0 so that explains why the new PSU is required not recommended I just checked for the remote sense function and saw the range 9 2A gives an extra 15w but the overhead still seems low for a product typically designed to not burn if used incorrectly esp without a cable strain relief Im glad someone designing for the limits of supporting hardware and forcing ppl to pay attention and appreciate what they are choosing It just seems like this condition should be able to be caught in software to limit the GPU Vdrop should have been bad enough at that point that something was aware of it and just let's it go I guess traditionally the problem was inversed Lower vdrop typically meant a lower wattage psu so the GPU would just be let go to failure as the current couldn't rise With higher wattage that's obv not the case Edit I tried looking for that earlier but just quickly found the prev spec I'm currently designing for production to use similar connectors and this is a problem I'm fighting heavily There are higher current connectors available but in qty the cost significantly goes up so you try and design around very specific cable requirements Again it seems like the 3 0 spec gives tighter tolerances on what should be seen in the real world
You could get that cable and route it this way or similar very soft bend and away from the connector and also looks nice
u Separate Feedback862
and the location is bad EVGA solved this problem by having it come out from the end of the card facing the front of the case
it may but im sure the IC etc in the connector end making that entire end of the adaptor rigid causing additional strain on the connector itself
There is an MSI one that sells that I am currently using without issue Description atx 203 0 20power 20supply cm re atx 3 0 20power 20supply 17 701 016 Product
I'd probably be doing the same
Exactly I buy an expensive card to work Last time I had to send my GTX 1080 TI to warranty I did get my money back but it took 2 months without a card that I could work on time to order new one
Generally they don't try to BS people on warranties with flagship products Negative press that early in a new product's lifecycle can be very damaging so the first adopters are taken care of I ordered the parts to build a PC from Newegg It was for a customer and they were on a tight time schedule I believe it was a birthday gift Newegg sent me the wrong processor and to make matters worse it wasn't even the right socket so I couldn't just use it I called Newegg and explained the issue and they over nighted me my entire order already assembled and upgraded the CPU to a faster model Never asked me to RMA the CPU or the original order and the person I spoke with worked at Newegg HQ It is a completely different business now that it is already established
Oh yeah that does make sense
Yes I totally want a 4090 y'know like I play esports titles anyway so Idgaf about what card I have lol maybe you need to stop assuming what others want
Hell even at 1440p there are plenty of games you'll struggle to hit over 90 with Ampere Modded Minecraft at 1440p brings my 4090 to it's knees Can't even get 50fps consistently
Yeah I forgot that the rtx 3090 could not do higher than 720p 30Hz Whoops
So what would be the use case of a quadro gpu then
I built a 3900x 32GB RAM 2080Ti PC in 2019 and its worked well paired with my Alienware 34 Ultrawide at 120Hz When i moved into my new house I suddenly have a game room and ended up outfitting it with an OLED for Xbox Series X PS5 and its been great But FPS games i cannot for the life of me play using a controller so I ended up connecting my PC to the OLED and that started the chain of events that caused me to buy a 3090Ti which i promptly returned and picked up the 4090 so i can get all the benefits of my display I also ended up swapping out my 3900x to a 5800X3D

They can try it everywhere but in Europe According to the EU law in first 12 month if something happens manufacturer has to prove bad handling by the end user
The cable size is limited by the connector size They will need a new connector
Need tape lol
Incorrect The voltage is irrelevant The power dissipation comes from the voltage DROP through the conductor times the current and the voltage drop is determined by the current times the resistance This can be simplified to current squared times resistance Your last statement is actually correct cranking up the voltage with constant power means the overall current is reduced and this lower current can be carried via thinner wires with less power lost to heat If nvidia wanted to use such a small connector for so much power the correct solution would have been to move to a significantly higher supply voltage such as 48 volts instead of 12 volts
They could cheap out they'll do anyway if they raise up the voltage to reduce the current Nobody likes to fuck with 50Amps so they could do 25A max with a 24V supply voltage They step it down to 1 2V 2V and 3 3V anyway with the regulators on board They will need to raise a bit the Mosfet's specs most seem to be 30V when used in a 12V application a 35V 55V breakdown N Ch MOSFETS would suffice Probably those 30V ones would work too hopefully you don't meet transients over 30V
Smells like burnt plastic
Molex Minifit Jr are the connectors standardized into the ATX design rules These are present in every single PC built since 1995 The Molex Minifit Jr datasheet specifically indicates that any alteration to the cable linear trajectory should be made after 25 4 mm from the connector for 10 12 pins dual row headers 44 45 mm for 22 24 pins sa t source web rct j url ved 2ahUKEwjWr5aN n6AhX9X EDHQQhDywQFnoECA0QAQ usg AOvVaw0SbCHVgTiBk7Rhbrowv7s3 Page 22 As previously mentioned it's absolutely nothing new to have such guidelines Edit all known cable management practices and strain relief methods comply with these numbers
Exactly what I thought of when I saw this post Dude straight up warned us ahead of time
Why would you use the adapter with an ATX 3 0 PSU when that has a native 16 pin PCIe 5 0 connector
Not true
My Bad I was mistaken
Are you sure of this I bought the zotac 4090 and it apparently caps at 450W so this would be a relief
Fair but they have to assume most users will assume all are needed and plug them all in anyways If they're buying a partner card that already comes oc'd I can see more issues with this connector arising in the near future
Not true It s not a power draw issue with the 4090s and the connector
not too sure but its not running a octopus on my case anymore lol
The performance per watt is seriously underwhelming Does it still beat the RTX 3090 on that category Yes but neither can really justify their price it s insanely out of hand and proportion I find it baffling that you asked a question about it's performance even linked a chart and then don't even bother reading the chart 4090 has an 83 rating 3090 is 76 and 3090 ti is 66 So not only are you wrong about It s basically previous gen with more memory a bus upgrade and POWAH turned to 11 but you doubled down and are wrong again As for the 't priced for gamers anymore It's priced for Machine learning and other commercial use Nvidia is going to charge as much as they can get away with because too many people bought from scalpers during the pandemic and now Nvidia is aware of the insane prices people will pay even if those prices heavily relied on mining to justify for people
Big time welll acktuallly energy
Well according to your comment most Nvidia products seem to suffer from poor quality control so maybe we should stay away from that brand
Literally never heard of any of that being reported by GN or online
It's not arcing it's caused by high resistance from a poor connection or undersized terminal or inappropriate material There may not be enough surface area at the connection the interface between terminals is not making contact completely there may be oxidation preventing full contact between terminals You can use an ohm meter to check resistance at the connection but that doesn't tell you what is happening under higher loads You would want to make the connection and then examine the terminals in order to determine if it's a mechanical connection issue or not In the short term I would undervolt the card and possibly put some dielectric grease in the connection until there is a response from the manufacturer
That connector that is melted is rated to 600w If what you are saying was the case the PSU connector would have been melted not the GPU This was caused by the connect being tweaked in socket This increases electrical resistance which caused the plug to melt
It would burn whee the
Meta stares intensely
In the oven wait for
He ain't gonnq give them Just wanted to put blame on the user as companies can't make mistakes lol
They've had a few Nvidia guests lately one of them is who the comment was directed at
He did a video with a NVIDIA engineer and they went over details of the card including this cable The racisim was directed at the engineer most likely
Housing The exterior part to the connection The part that sheilds the transfer of power from other sources
The size of the PSU wouldn't cause the cable connection to burn it would just shut down
That isn't how cables work If the cable and connector are rated for the load they should be fine What you are describing would damage the PSU not the opposite end of a wire
Why would that have anything to do with this If power draw was higher than psu could handle it would shut off That didn t happen An unrelated connector burned
That shouldn t burn the adapter
That's not how electricity ratings work If you have a 600W cable It should have no issues handling that power Even if the PSU is being drawn for more power than what's recommended by the manufacturer while being inside the cable limits of course there should be no fire at the end of the cable
No that's not how cables work Anything under 600 watts is fine regardless of PSU If the PSU isn't powerful enough you will experience instability If the PSU is POORLY DESIGNED you will experience possible damage to components It's the cable that is poorly designed Absolutely nothing to do with too little power draw and the 4090 isn't drawing more than 600 watts which may have caused this issue if it did but it's not specified to draw over the 600w cable
That is most likely just because Corsair has a 2x8pin to 1x 12VHPWR instead of having 4 to 1 especially if the PSU has a multi rail setup Every 8pin has to deliver 150W what Corair does is going 100 over the 8 pin spec Afaik corsair does usually 2 rails so a RM1000x has two rails that each can supply 450W so if the customer draws 600 and plugs both into the same x200B Apart from that which essentially confirms my assumption is that BeQuiet recommends 850W while Corsair wants 1200 Also even if the PSU was undersized and the GPU would pull more than it could handle then in the worst case scenario the PSU would die but certainly not the connector
Your statement doesnt make any sense If it was a problem with the PSU or cables it's cables it wouldnt burn on the GPU's end the PSU is certainly intact
It will I have a 3090ti and will be buying the 4090ti or 4090 So yea I know what I m talking about All cards become obsolete with every new gen
Still defending Nvidia when they should've just made a cable that wasn't shit
Sure but then you eat shit cause you lose the warranty
Most people don t know what they are doing but somehow you are the only one that does Yeah makes sense Everyone is wrong If only we could be just as enlightened as you are and do the kinds of mental gymnastics you do to defend a corporation instead of blaming the obvious design flaw If only
Exactly why i bought an ATX 3 0 PSU before the 4090 even launched to the public Was not risking a damn near 4000 dollar build due to a shotty adapter that also just flatout looks horrendous anyway
He posted a picture above go look at it
My card was working fine for a week before the adapter burned
Use thermaltake view 71 and use 1600w PSU 5gen it has GPU wire for rtx 4090
You literally took 1 one very specific case and called it very 4090 owner Some of us play mostly games like cyberpunk flight sim hitman 3 plague tale at 4k max settings and the performance is greatly appreciated Live your own life and stop resenting what other people do with their money Also some of us work in video editing and the performance is so appreciated for quality of life
Small publicly traded company You right tho awesome
That sarcasm nearly went over my head
You and OP have given me pause I have a pickup scheduled for tomorrow at Best Buy for mine I was already very apprehensive about that tiny adapter and the cable bend which is why I already bought my vertical mount Still I can't unsee these images you guys
A bit on the right side and the cable ends upwards Not forcibly bend and there isn't anything about it on the instructions
I feel you whish you best however out of my experience with ASUS in the past they are not the quickest one in replaying or solving issues But regarding this msi isn't far better however they do replay fairly quickly but resolve nothing everything turns in to endless email exchange until it is eventually solved Not sure which is worse the one not replaying and slow or this endless ping ponging emails without resolving all the same shit when it comes to RMA by everyone they just want your money promising everything and actually doing NOTHING
the issue is clear poor contact increases resistance increases heat x200B design a better connector with better contact able to deal with 600W these gpus are just 420w imagine 600w that is supposed to draw from there
I saw an article about that cable replacement but I didn't have my 4090 yet so I didn't pay attention to itman facepalming medium dark skin tone Do you remember who is selling it I'm gonna need one for sure

Yeah they all seem to use the same adapter it even said Nvidia on it rather than the third party company Hopefully seasonic sends me the 12VHPWR cable for my 1000W PSU that I just bought yesterday
For light games running at crazy FPS swings in FPS such as looking at a wall sky to looking down a hall can produce big power excursions I'd suggest an FPS limiter in these situations or vsync
then it is a design issue that bend appears purely due to the weight of the cables
It really isn't that bad Not to mention that many cases cannot support a gentle bend if you mount the card in the standard orientation The cards are already huge TBH the adapter is kind of ridiculous and I don't know why Nvidia didn't provide us with a lower profile cable
Sounds like your cable management is garbage
Yep it seems the cable was designed with wider than the average computer case in mind
That huge bend literally looks like its only the cable's own weight making it settle Notice how the entire cable is curved
Or Nvidia can ship a 2000 usd gpu with a cable that doesn't burn when bent in a way that is needed for the system to not look like shit
The new NVidia paper launch moto You can buy our 't install them 3rd party support isn't ready yet
According to the specs you are allowed to bend the cable 35mm away from the connector Jayztwocents new video discussed this
Where does the 35mm come from Is that official from the PCIPW ISO or anything
Sure hard braided cables or fiber data cables These adapters are none of the above
Can you even think critically or only read instructions Its a cable a power cable Nothing more If bending it makes it go up in flames the design and or quality of materials is absolute garbage
Haven't mentioned it anywhere They were reasonable before when I had to rma a pair of ram sticks in the past I hope they will answer soon x200B Nvidia has been supportive though
yes it will be also available at the EU store at the 31st d we will introduce a new faster shipping method as well
our cable kits featuring this cable are currently shipping to Amazon As of now you can only buy them direct from us let me know if you need any assistance
yes we tested it and it fits
it will work with the 3090TI as well
What is the pricing No matter what I ll get it but just curious
every customer receives multiple emails after the order was placed and is being kept in the loop you seem to know your shipping date so I am assuming you got an email with the information as well I am personally having 2 left hands so I m sadly not capable to help the production guys or there will be a bunch of faulty cables shopping l
The problem could be the direction of the bend see
So is mine have they really designed these cards to blow up in your average case most of us have very little clearance between where the cable needs to go and the case door glass
Or yours is going to light fire at a moments notice
or it is jsut a time to your conector got burned aswell x200B I mean i dont want that for you and for anybody but just saying cuz this was a issue before launch where everyone was scared about adapters got burned so here it is a real case
maybe it just hasn't happened yet
One connector fries and people talk about class actions and widespread
You should buy cablemod's right angle adapter when it comes out next week if your bend is that bad
Do you have a fire fetish You know this is a serious fire hazard right Why would you force close your case put a 90 bend Do you want to burn your house
Horizontal vs vertical can be a huge difference Any lateral stress is maximized on the two furthest pins instead of a full row of 6 pins Add to that the connector is only supported in the center and I think we'll see more issues with vertical mounts frying then horizontal
You may want to reinspect those pins on the cable See if any of the pins seem to have been pulled back a little
The cable should be rigid until that point then If that is the cause of the melt then companies are moving the flaw to the consumer that may or may not know that
And how are you supposed to achieve that It's a cable it is flexible Honestly how can you even design shit like this We are talking 2000 gpus here Good job Nvidia good job With raptor lake your first nvme slot is either not working or underperforming now this I think i will just return all that garbage and keep playing retrogrames
I'm not saying you're wrong but where does it say this Where would the average user see this information If it's in the manual for the car fine I don't have one to confirm this though can you confirm it
the sense pins wouldn't cause a power surge The PSU doesn't push power into the GPU The GPU pulls power from the PSU The GPU pulled too much power through a loose bad connection in the 12V side of the connector which lead to the connector burning up
I'm curious to see if these devices become ubiquitous and if anyone gets zapped 48V at 5 amp is getting pretty serious so I can totally see how mangled ports frayed cables or moisture could potentially start melting things USB power delivery is pretty smart but still we've had problems with less explody phones melting fans etc
Nobody asked you
And you don't see WHY Cablemod asks not to bend a certain way The same rules don't apply when you don't have ALL of the pinout cables glued and braided together in a row see how different the strain on the 4 pronged adapter is Also his bend is not even aggressive AT ALL Take a break already rolling on the floor laughing
Yeah I live with fam I don't pay rent but I contribute to other bills per month Trust me leeching is not something I want to do
I'm getting scared that we are seeing the final products in the consumer pci e form factor I don't think Nvidia wants to keep selling entertainment GPU's to end users in the public but rather trun their technology into a service in stead of product Microsoft is doing this with Xbox also much more profit margin Maybe not this generation or next but it seems like it's coming
To be fair the 4090 has a bug performance increase compared to the 3090ti
wtf are you talking about the performance increase from 30 series to 40 series is actually worth to upgrade if you need one
I think half these people think were running around with halo looking shit I can assure you we are definitely not or that we are all running around shoulder firing 50 cals
You re alright girl
LENNEH
Remember to say no if they try to replace it with a 'better' 4090Ti 4GB
GPU is still working but ye i RMA it anyway Is the GPU in any way showing damage or burning If not and it is working perfectly why would you RMA Only the cable would then be damaged
Ah yes the scourge of youtubers flaunting their 30 series cards with Zork benchmarks
Right I just lucked into a founders from Best Buy for 1100 I don t think you re finding one anywhere new for less than that
On the internet Even in the US you had them for sale for 900 usd
Last year I bought a 3090 from them which died after a month Then a motherboard which was also from them died overnight They tried to blame me for it by claiming that a bunch of capacitors had been broken off on the back I managed to get my money back only after I threatened to take legal action after months of getting nowhere
Can you please elaborate on this How is the card crashing I have ordered the same card and I'm worried after seeing some user feedback on it Reviews didn't mention anything bad about the card so this is really surprising to me
Are you saying this jokingly or do you actually have such issues with it
Just be sure to follow our guide here
You could have kept that to yourself though I've seen repeated comments like this throughout the web about people who have the means to buy a 4090 and theres always this air of arrogance disdain or envy that flows from it Like why does it matter to you how another person spends their money Provided they dont hurt anyone why do you care so much
Cuz he adds nothing of value Everything he says he pulls out of his ass more or less with the exception of watercooling the only thing he is good at He explains things in such a general and broad manner not to simplify it for the viewer but because he does not know better himself Most of what he spews is either blatantly obvious or plain speculation
Okay but if someone is generally stupid why waste your time listening to ANYTHING they have to say
Because he speaks for the sub s
There's some pull in the pictures but not that bad but it seems like these cables are just that easy to damage even if its not under continuous strain It could have been pulled sharply trying to figure out how to put it together and once that's done the connector's a fire hazard
It's even more likely It's a manufacturing defect Nah this smells of bad design They also knew about it but was very confident in the design says nvidia
All AIB 4090s use them
All AIB 4090s use this 12 pin connector 12 4 sens because Nvidia enforced it on them Me as a customer would've been happy with 4x8PIN cables now I won't buy a 4090 for concern of having the cable burn
The number if pins is irrelevant honestly There are plenty of connectors that do 100A per pin just fine There is no minimum number of pins for power transfer that is higher than 2 Hell even hobby level connectors like XT90 or XT60 exist and do just fine
Lets see what Nvidia say man hopefully they will tell us if its safe or not lol
Thank you sir I think I have 35m clearance but it s hard to say my case is pretty big
I believe the GPU is designed with the next generation of PSUs in mind with this adapter being a edit backwards compatibility thing
The card won't even work if not enough PCIe connectors are plugged into the adapter The minimum that will work is 3 450W but you won't get any OC options
No the point is the card won't draw it's full amount
Nvlink
The 3090 Ti was the only model that had this connector across all models The rest of the 30 series had it on the FE versions only
Write that down write that down Jensen probably
Thats sucks My cousin was pretty hyped to buy 4090 I hope he doesnt buy it
Yeah this doesn't look at all unreasonable to me not to mention the user can't really be blamed if it wasn't stated in their face what to not do x200B That's why I get frustrated when people say OP should've researched better and stuff like that no one should have to research how to plug in something like a GPU lol Now I still think this connector is stupid and shouldn't have been done in the first place but NVidia and AIBs should be putting big warning labels in the boxes saying you can't bend them at all due to fire risk if they aren't going to just abandon this thing
Yeah for sure think this is spot on it technically is user error but really should be designed better to avoid that or at the very least there should be clear warnings all over about it needing to be inserted fully and not under any kind of strain
Ops build so you get more context Agreeing with you on user error after seeing that
Noobs I m out here between the Tigris and Euphrates with my abacus calculating all the fancy RTX things by hand and abacus
You have a 270 I still have a 1981 IBM MDA face with rolling eyes
You got a 275 I'm still rocking my 9800 gt
so that explains why the new PSU is required not recommended Uhm did you mean the opposite Otherwise I don't understand what you mean ATX 3 0 PSU is not mandatory for 4090s just the cable Vdrop should have been bad enough at that point that something was aware of it and just let's it go Well there is the CARD PWR STABL pin but even if ATX 3 0 PSUs were in wide use already today we wouldn't really know if what you ask for is present on the 4090 or other Ada GPU boards That is until someone knowledgeable tested it somehow or Nvidia or an AIB spilled the beans on the specifics And I haven't seen any of that yet
yep that's similar to what I am thinking Thanks for confirming
face with tears of joyface with tears of joy
read this this is the 12VHPWR cable I do not know who the fuck at PCI SIG is responsible for this atrocity of a connector they should be fired
This is exactly what I'm using Picked it up from Microcenter when I bought my 4090 No issues at all
It s not selling where I am
The irony is that s exactly what you re doing
I use my 3080 for gaming and work The GeForce series is just good for everything Not saying the Quadro series couldn't game as well but it's also extremely expensive The same people who cry about the 4090's price are the first to ask why not get a Titan or Quadro instead and they're the stupidest people to ever exist This is 5000 vs 1600
Oh OK Well I'm happy I'm wrong I looked everywhere for a new psu and everything I saw that I could buy was just your standard pci 6 or 8 pin
I never knew these existed I thought it just went to ATX12VO Do you know if EVGA Corsair or Seasonic do them
wtf Ive been checking every day for ages trying to get one
Yes of course it's related to wire thickness to thanks for clarifying that BTW but regarding the power it's directly related to the total amount of electrons flowing through which doubling the volts and halving the amps won't change
The link you gave me was access denied so I had to find it myself 1st of all the prior 8 pin was 19mm the 6 pin was 12mm This connector is 35mm or a 54 increase of the 8 pin before you can start your bend Next unlike the prior molex connectors this one has a complete prohibition on horizontal bends Next the guide specifically says that these bends are subject to factors of insulation and cable gauge Given the fact that molex connectors were and still are heavily abused and do not see these failures shows that even with these guidelines the connectors are capable of exceeding basic design recommendations Now it is not like the use case for power cables going to a GPU are unknown The general case design and cable management techniques have not changed in over a decade Designing a connector cable without taking into account how it will be used connected is a flaw in design methodology Taking a connector that will not be compatible with cases and make standard cable management impossible unless you manage in a way that is dangerous to the system is a design flaw While the cable itself may follow known guidelines it s use and location on the PCB of this gpu is most definitely a design flaw It is like engineering a bridge on a route frequented by semis but only designing it to have 2 semis at a given time It will be a fine bridge but not a fine bridge for its purpose Edit since you think 35mm is standard cable management tell me where you see no bend on the cable on these systems everyone of those systems either bends horizontally or starts the curve right out of the connector
He sure did but unfortunately not many people saw that video
I don't see how sense pins would suddenly work on a PSU's PCB that doesn't have ATX 3 0 sense pins soldered on That makes absolutely no sense
However to be safe don t bend your cable at the connector 450 watts is also a lot of power and can indeed melt plastic Just stick to the guidelines I know a lot of people that haven t had the melt issues despite OCing the card to 600 watts
No don t listen to him It s not a power draw issue It s an issue with the pins potentially backing out of the connector causing them to misalign which in turns causes the connectors to arc which generates too much heat inside the connector housing It s not related to power draw
Indeed Looks like Nvidia tested their card out for the FE and said it was all okay They didn t factor in AIB overclock cards Their cable works just enough for the founders edition However their board partners are not doing so well due to this
Ohh Got it Thanks for the explanation
The damage could theoretically be anywhere along the length of the cable the adapter end or PSU
How is the connector unrelated when it's specially the connector that tells the PSU how much power to draw lol
Okay what should it do then
The issue isn't the adapter it's the under powered power supply This is the first time this type of cable has been used in the wild Yeah I agree 1000W should be enough but if you read Corsairs website they specifically state that 600W load requires 1200W PSU Do the math OP was using a 1000W PSU and likely exceeded 450W power draw How hard is it
The connector itself has a chip inside it that tells the PSU how much power to draw It's simple The cable told the PSU to draw more power than it could deliver Since the cable itself is what is controlling the power draw the point of failure is going to be there instead of the PSU
Yes it makes sense lol The adapter has a chip that tells the PSU how much power to draw This is completely different than the behaviour we are used to seeing with any previous GPU and PSU combination
You guys are a moronic hive mind Guys use your brains The top row of pins are the ones that burned becuase they had a bad
Lmao You took 1 very specific case and called it every 4090 owner Proceeds to take another very specific anecdotal case and use it to generalize Most 3090 and 4090 owners barely know what a teraflop is Just a fact Nobody is resenting people for having or using money how they like I have plenty of money and use it for stupid shit all the time It's just a very noticeable pattern with people who buy those GPUs They even make 3090 4090 clubs and act like they're yachts lmao It's good you actually use yours but you are the exception not the rule
A bit on the right side and the cable ends upwards Not forcibly bend and there isn't anything about it on the instructions Good to know Thanks for posting
I'm an engineer myself that helped me identifying the risks with the 12VHPWR connector that's why I said I dislike it in first place and is fragile then as I don't have the 3 0 5 0 PCIE standard PSU but very capable nevertheless one Leadex Super Flower 1000W Special Edition 80 Gold and using 4 direct cables without split yes Leadex actually provides 8 pin VGA cables without and with additional 8 pin connector split once everything was assembled that thing had a weight altogether so now I was forced to find a way not to bend the cable to run them in way and fashion they don't put an extra strain on the 12VHPWR plug on the VGA ending up in creating a massive cable BUS then run it in a way that it support itself and not hanging from the VGA plug Ofc the previous clean aesthetics of my case is ruined
you got it
Cable mod
I'd like to see what they've done to reinforce it
I'm waiting on mine as well from Seasonic for my PX 1300 They're supposed to start shipping end of month I may put in the Cablemod in the meanwhile if it comes in time The NVIDIA adapter is very stiff to your point My adapter now goes slightly to the side While far from extreme and I tried to keep bending away from the connector as much as possible I'm going to be careful and replace with different cables
Any particular 1000 watt PSU
You mean open bench With a crane to support the
That is not 35mm from the connector
Here
It's what Nvidia CableMod recommend
If they say don't bend it and you proceed to bend it that is on you
They deserve to be exposed for their treatment of I was extremely careful with the cable bend issues and have a 1000watt PSU Mines pulling 582 watts slightly OC on furmark Good luck mate and hope you get sorted and well done for positing this for the world to see I personally can't see them doing much apart from a if you're lucky If this retailer has already ignored you I doubt they will be quick to give you your cash back Maybe they know it will set a precedent they are worried about or maybe they are waiting to see what Nvidia has to say on this issue Either way they SHOULD get back to you one way or another mate its unprofessional and bad customer service After all they were quick enough to take your money
Nice I assume that is for both direction options
I had to check with my order number daily on your website to find out my ship date so no I didn't get any emails Nice of you to assume I did however
Don't bend vertically nor horizontally If that's the case don't give us a flexible cable to begin with
There s gonna be a lot of melted connectors
what a shit show given the size of the cards connectors few users are going to have the 35mm required that image is a poor excuse to try waive culpability from cabelmod
Sounds like they should have put a strain relief backshell on it that's just plain negligent
They were designed for open mining rigs
have they really designed these cards to blow up in your average case yeah every single one of them
It's just one incident out of thousands possibly millions of 4090s sold Relax EDIT
And people are still quoting that old internal document that is no longer relevant
Thanks for mentioning this You can actually sign up for updates and check out more info on the adapter here
I'm not worried about it
Thats a stupid number of downvotes for trying to help people prevent a mishap or fire in your case Have it your way folks It's been only 2 weeks the 4090's been out
I used this guide to determine how to bend my cable I'm fine Quit fear mongering
I don't know how that would be possible since the glass panel is literally pressing the pins in place at the intended angle but I checked anyway and we're golden
Well I have one and it IS pretty rigid honestly OP bent it
I'm not debating the merits or lack thereof with the cable design I'm just trying to let people know how to avoid issues with their own builds so this doesn't potentially happen to them
My GPU came with an instruction card illustrating now NOT to lay out the cable and also showed the proper orientation I assume the other GPU's also do but nobody ever reads the instructions
and if anyone gets zapped 48V at 5 amp is getting pretty serious It could be 48VDC at a thousand amps and it would still be safe to touch The impedance of the human body limits the current even in the worst case scenario with sweaty hands you'd have to try hard to feel a tingle Here's a video of me holding on to 50V as tight as I can which results in 0 8mA at flowing through me at most
Check the picture It was mounted vertically
The OP posted a pic 23 mins ago that shows the setup So you can probably stop pretending you know it was bent too much and just look at that
Don't throw your toys out the pram and go look at the OP's pics twit
The connection on the GPU end is IDENTICAL between the cable types which is exactly where he bent it horizontally You cannot bend the cable before the 40 45mm point after the GPU connector otherwise this will happen
That's fair And 100 you made the right move not wasting time or money with college Get those certs and make 200k yr by the time you're 27
Ohh i apologise I read your comment wrong I read that you were not helping with bills
You can still pay rent at your parents place Or
That's fair And 100 you made the right move not wasting time or money with college Get those certs and make 200k yr by the time you're 27
Only the 4090 has significant gains over its predecessor The discontinued 4080 sucked so bad for 900 which u probably can t get at this price
You get downvoted but I agree If you aren't poor and want the best the uplift is huge in games like cyberpunk Been driving through night city with full RTX on and it's AMAZING
cause the connector is burned
yoooooooooooo lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo
dw we're joking lmao
It was 900 last month was all over the PC build subreddit Here its even less
I guess i was lucky with my first batch of 3080 gigabyte gaming oc run fine for more than 2 year very good temp even after 10 month of 24 7 mining Only issue was they used cheap ass memory pads for cooling memory temps were anove 90 before changing the pads for gelid one that dropped mem temp to sub 85 sub 80 before mining
No I literally just returned it Since buying it I only had problems with this GPU Can't play games with it after paying more than 2300 euros for a GPU I expect it to work and not deal with bullshit
Easy answer When people spend big buck on garbage Manufacturers continue to provide shit and overpriced products like this one You dont need to be a genius to figure it out They do hurt the average consumer
Fair enough sounds like you aren t really his target demo which is fine Adds nothing of value is a bit harsh he does great things for the pc enthusiast community like his recent pop up sale of all his old hardware his micro center builds for fans and things like building that computer for the girl who got hosed by Artesian Builds He also built a center to teach kids about building computers in the LA area making pc building more accessible to the youth He s not the channel to watch if you want technical breakdowns of hardware or software but he s a genuinely nice dude that makes some entertaining content To each their own though he s not for everyone
You don t You make your own informed opinion rather than just saying X PERSON SAID THIS AND I DONT LIKE THEM SO ITS AUTOMATICALLY UNTRUE
I m out of the loop why is he stupid What has he said
I think NVIDIA intended that plug to be installed either vertically or latch side up even NVIDIA installed it latch side down The AIB partner f'd up and installed the latch facing down which doesn't allow the top of the connector to stay seated when downward strain is applied Edit Looking at a few cards though ALL of them have this configuration with the latch being on the bottom That is an oversight on NVIDIA here considering last gen the connector was aligned vertically making this a non issue NVIDIA just fucked up installing the plug upside down on the board
Interesting I've not seen a lot of pictures of Aib 4090 cards Even still that just proves Nvidia is still pushing the standard that others have yet to adopt
Yeah the 4080's power draw may be the 'safe' top end for this connector Maybe a substantially power limited 4090 I'd buy an AIB card sporting as many 8 pin connectors as necessary as an upgrade in lieu of this
It is relevant because once the individual wire gauge gets too large the umbilical can't make bends My comment was from the perspective of this particular connector type density which appears to be a variant of a Molex MicroFit 3 0 There's nothing wrong with this type of connector but for the current limits it's running too close to the margins under the incorrect assumption that the current across all the pins will be balanced When not if for any reason the load becomes unbalanced umbilical issues poor crimping psu rails unbalanced partial strand breaks in individual leads this spec has minimal overhead To really be safe at its supposed 600w spec this connector in this format needs more pins
they will tell you that it is safe even when it is not that connector design is so trash not just the one on the gpu but the one on the cable adapter
Dude yeah It's gotta be massive to be able to mount that monstrous GPU in the standard orientation Looks fantastic
What is your case if you dont mind sharing Hard to find a case large enough to fit it in
hank you sir I think I have 35m is not about the 35mm clearance is that the cables need to come out of the connector straight and yours are bent in an angle they say you need to bend the cables 90 so the cables from the connector go straight into the gpu but nobody is gonna bend the cables 90
But they had these dongles since the RTX 3000 series nbsp If they really need a custom solution should it be built into the GPU Then as the consumer I don't have to do anything different I just use the industry standard plugs from my PSU directly into the card and forget about it
I thought I'd seen it said one would work but be limited to 150w
Oh okay That's fair I jumped from a 3080 FE to a Gigabyte 3090 ti when those dumped off the cliff Since both had the connector I just assumed AIBs by and large used it as well
Was the 3090 ti only actually many regular 3090s still used the older ATX connectors I have a TUF 3090 with 2 8 pins installed
LOL Your card doesn't even use a 12 pin which is weird cause damn near every single 30 series card I've seen takes the 12 pin I sense a liar Either way this is clearly not a widespread issue considering 30 series all use this same connector and this is the first time I've seen damage like this It's either user error or a short on the card itself causing the heat It could be the latter
The problem isn't in the GPU itself just the cable plug
Years per frame s
Voodoo 2 all the way baby Half life here i come
I haven't really been following this close this showed up in my all feed I honestly assumed it would be a requirement after seeing the number The cable looks to address it by stacking wires to try and prevent it but doesn't seem to be working properly I'd love to see a thermal pic of the connector when used in different configs power supplies daisy chain connectors and with strain I have a camera just no gpu The weight of 4 connectors pulling down on the connector seems bad too esp after the wires heat up and sag more I'm coming from the PMBus controller programming area To me this is a condition that is easily programmed out if monitored correctly even if it's a hardware solution for the regulator ICs The Stable pin does look like what Im after but all it seems to do is trigger the PSU to correct the situation without giving the procedure on how it corrects it It's weird that the CPU line gets a specific remote sense like to cover vdrop yet the GPU only gets a bell to ring
i have seen it and the video by buildzoid the connector sucks but i believe the issue is made worse by the ridgid end of the adaptor since it is the one putting extra strain on the connector IF the cables were soft it would be easier to make the bends without added horizontal force on the connector
I didn't get that how do I look like I'm begging for an rtx 4090
Provoked him and it hit instant Some
If you're talking about how much heat the card itself produces sure that is the current times the supply voltage But the heating in the wires and connectors does not depend on the supply voltage only the current And total number of electrons flowing is literally the definition of current by the way 1 amp 1 coulomb of electrons per second
Our entire grid is designed off of higher voltages and lower current It allows wires to be thinner without burning up This is fundamental to electricity Instead of rambling made up logic and reasons you should just Google about it
Watch gamers nexus video on how these sensors work and also watch Nvidia engineer explain how this works Does not need an atx 3 0 psu buddy
I think I have more than enough clearance to close my case without this being an issue We shall see but I refuse to leave my side panel off just to accommodate a shit design
Honestly that's why I'm not even considering trying to get one right now between the demand and the issues needed to be worked out It's not worth my money yet
Everybody hated the 2000 series wtf lmao
If the cable and connectors are both below their rated load and used correctly then no only the devices on either end will be damaged
A psu uses OCP Over current protection If the draw is too large it just shuts off This psu connector and psu didn t think the draw was too large It just continued to provide the power it was asked for correctly Until the plastic pins couldn t take it The psu being 1500 instead of 1000 would not change this If the psu was in fact too small it would have just activated OCP
Too much heat at the connector from the continuous power draw
It would trip OCP you d hear a click and the pc would immediately shut down The recommendation comes from covering for transient spikes If the scenario you are proposing was to damage anything it would be the psu
That makes no sense 1 That logic only works with ATX3 0 PSUs with an adapter cable 4 to 1 that doesn't work 2 Not the gpu tells the PSU but the other way around the GPU gets informed by the PSU how much it is allowed to draw 3 The cable doesn't control power draw at all
It tells how much to draw based on how many cables are connected to the adapter Plus it wont draw more than 450W unless the power limit is set higher Check GN video about it And again the problem happened at the board connection It doesn't matter if the PSU is capable or not It melts because it gets hot if the PSU wasn't capable there wouldn't be the same current flowing in the connector which in turn wouldn't make it so hot
I don't think most people spend 1 600 just to be King of the Hill I am not a rich person But I do save up money or at tax time treat myself to something nice that I will enjoy I've been 4K gaming for several years now and having a high end card is nice to have so that I can play at the highest fidelity I think you're being very general with your statements And people form clubs not to brag but to connect with people who have similar interests Will there be people who brag Yes That's just human nature
Likewise I was not impressed by the 12VHPWR connector from Amphenol It just seems too small and smaller contacts usually mean higher contact resistance leading to reduced current ratings due to thermal limitations I certainly would not choose to use it myself Amphenol claim a continuous current rating per pin of 9 5 Amps The saving grace is a specified contact resistance of just 6 milliohms but even that results in a dissipation of 6 5W if all pins are at rated current It'll therefore be very important to use the PCB foils and harness wires to effectively cool those contacts That's where Nvidia have fallen over tripped up IMHO You have to engineer a part into equipment taking it's ratings fully into consideration including heat generation In comparison a Molex Mini Fit used on previous PCIe power connectors with 12 contacts at the maximum rating of 6A per pin results in a power loss from electrical resistance of 4 3W in a larger housing size better able to handle the heat The contacts are larger too Personally I'd likely choose a 16 or 20 contact connector for that level of current A 16 contact Mini Fit can safely handle 48 Amps 576W 12V and a 20 contact 60 Amps 720W 12V The 12VHPWR connector with its sketchy spec is supposedly good for 684W 12V data sheet values so I fail to see any real advantage it has other than a very questionable one re physical size I'm rambling Anyway that Nvidia 'adaptor' has just ended up being a totally unwieldy POS The restrictions they impose on bending it are beyond ridiculous too A connections to a graphics card NEEDS to be flexible for 's sake Elsewhere I've suggested another implementation entirely using properly crimped wires that'll also flex easily and weigh less too I've suggested it to Gamer's Nexus
Thank you folded hands medium dark skin tone
I don't know that it needs reinforcing I think it is just less cables merging into one connector so it's not as stiff and you aren't putting as much pressure on the connector itself I think it's the stiffness around the adapter that creates the additional pressure that's causing issues Plus people are trying to route the cable in weird ways someone else on this post has a lot of strain on their adapter because they're routing it from the side not realizing that putting the adapter in at an angle like that will increase the resistance wherever there's a gap which generates heat and can potentially melt the adapter
Seasonic Prime GX 1000 if you hold off you can just buy an ATX 3 0 PSU otherwise just buy a really good 850W PSU
There is no way anybody cannot bent this cable It's just impossible Mounted
Lmao Are you fr right now
They never replied to my messages On friday though I got a separate email that the rma application has been approved But no answer to my messages or what so ever x200B And yeah I was thinking about what you mentioned as well that they might have been waiting for manufacturer nvidia comments but yeah still could've just replied something x200B Now I am just waiting for an answer from Asus if I sent the card to retailer or not x200B I just hope this process won't take too long Tbh 1070ti is pretty shit compared to 4090 D
Also nice to hear that you have a working gpu
Yes
so it appears that there is a way for you to check what are you complaining about Are we not allowed to interact with people just because we are working in a big amount of orders We are sorry that the other processing takes longer than usually but we are very transparent about it and reachable on all platforms to talk with us about it
My thoughts exactly Make that thing rigid as hell if it's gonna fry with bending
Imagine selling a 1600 msrp video card with a cheaped out connector Wow
If that was the cause yes we'll know soon enough as if so there will end up being many So if that's the case Nvidia should just issue safe cables to every owner as it's just unsafe let alone such an expensive card
Oh I agree you'd see that in my other comments The contacts need to be fixed and if after that bending had any risk of problems then it shouldn't be possible to bend it near the risk point And 90 degree connectors should have been in the box from the start
they are 2 already
Will a lot of these be available
what I'm really interested in is a 180 degree connector since mine I vertically mount and I want my cable to go down instead of into the motherboard Are there any plans for this as well
Yes we know lol you've been promoting the cable heavily on this site Can't believe you haven't been modded for spam yet Probably cause people actually want these adapters Funny how that
Nvidia are not forcing anyone to bend cables 90 degrees they expect you to safely have enough room for it even if they know full well that around half or more of all buyers don't have an adequately sized case However they don't care as they have passed that responsibility to you the moment you buy it and could even refuse an RMA if you were found to have not been cabling safely
There s bending then there s 90 degree bending
Why are we still referencing this old document It's already been debunked
Now why didn't you say that before Good job
I was implying something like this btwaf 89480827 could happen 3rd row left pic You'd be able to see on the front end if one of the female pins is misaligned set back in the connector
1 We see on the picture that the bending begins after the heatshrink which ends about 3 5cm away from the connector Nvidia in their 4090 manual doesn't state not to bend it and so far I haven't seen any 4090 box that had instructions about not bending the cable 2 The issue will still arise if you don't use a VHPWR to 4x8pin adapter but a PCIE5 power supply that has natively one of those connectors x200B Telling people that generally you are not allowed to bend the cable for the first 4 5cm at all will render most pc cases obsolete except for some big towers In the end it is just a testimony to what bellends designed that connector
My 4090 did not I just opened up up my box to check Only thing it says not to do is daisy chain 8pin cables And that wasn't in the manual it was on a sticker in the bag the adapter came in
Fair enough if it's in the manual then people shouldn't do this Thanks for clarifying it
Oh no no no I'm not saying zapped as in killed or anything like that More concerned about sparks melting and crap like that hence the comment on frayed wires shorting or moisture Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't you running just 1 amp through that resistor that melts What happens if you run 5 Just curious as I haven't got equipment like that to test the real world with so I appreciate your input thumbs up
I just did and he's improperly bending the cable Here's what NOT to do You can see in the photo he's bending it horizontally which you're not supposed to do
Where did this photo go I looked through everything he posted on the OP These cables don't just spontaneously combust after all This kid did something stupid with it guaranteed
I did you slag He bent the cable in some stupid way and is now somehow dumbfounded that this happened
You still need a break
Thanks man that is the plan The organization I am with now has a lot of leadership positions opening up due to retirements so I've been nose to the grindstone Appreciate the kind words
You should mind your own damn business
this is stupid as fuck if his parents want him to save his money and enjoy his life and not have to worry about shit Then he can do whatever he wants Even if that's drawing in a color book
The discontinued 4080 would have been the 4070 equivalent not a 3080 competitor The 4080 still releasing is going to be the 3080 competitor
The only people upgrading right now are the ones that don't care about their money anyway
Maybe But I can tell you If you wanted a 4k120 card This is it for sure now
Speak for yourself Outright 4k gaming performance it's mint for
Oh well then I missed that but if the GPU connector is burned then it's an instant RMA
Well I didn t know that Fair enough
It sounds like they used to have better quality control but it's gone to hell over the last 2 3 years
Yikes that's really really bad
I'm sorry to hear that I was asking because I saw people complaining about Gigabyte cards all the time and I was curious as to why And yes this is absolutely not ok
It's still a shitty thing to say You didn't ask because you wanted an answer you asked because you wanted to make him feel bad about his purchase
garbage is completely subjective If this expensive piece of garbage makes me the money back is it still garbage I'm sorry that you guys are getting reamed in the EU with GPU prices but there's no need to be salty about it
I'm not saying he is a bad dude or doesn't do other cool stuff I just meant solely from a tech standpoint as a tech enthusiast which certainly is also one of his target demographics He kinda pretends to really know what he is talking about which I find annoying Hence I think he is a dumbass in that regard If he has other entertainment community charity value that's great for him
No one said that either It's more like anything he has to say doesn't hold much credence
This one is made by Amphenol instead of Molex old ones
Found it Fractal Design Define 7
Trying to recall what model this was the only part i didn't change on my new rig so i bought it a few years ago pretty sure its a NZXT case
Yeah I guessed as much I ll wait for the cable mod adapter I guess
I don't remember this plug being used on the 3000 's the plan for the next generation of PSUs You'll use just a straight cable
Ah damnit I made the exact same mistake I was trying to fix thanks for pointing it out
3090 3080 ftw3 use 3 8 pins Gigabyte 3070 3080 use molex Zotac 3070 use 2 molex
So do you need to buy a better quality cable for 4090
Reincarnations per frame
Here's a 4 minute summary t 318 by Gamers Nexus which you'll probably find interesting if this post and its comments are the first you've heard of it It has the burned photos that Nvidia sent out via PCI SIG You may also have seen references to a WCCFTech article where the media hubbub started and a JayzTwoCents video based on that article However both contain errors and erroneous conclusions Nvidia enables the SENSE lines to switch between 450W or 600W or don't turn on at all modes using an AND IC in the cable Igor's Lab article w schematic This is a functional workaround for pre ATX 3 0 PSUs thus making them not required while still using the 12 pin connector but all it seems to do is trigger the PSU to correct the situation without giving the procedure on how it corrects it Yeah I've been looking for that as well The explanations from intermediaries I've seen say that CARD PWR STABL is a signal from the device telling the PSU The power you're sending is bad turn off but no explanation that I can find of what conditions let the device send that signal It's weird that the CPU line gets a specific remote sense like to cover vdrop yet the GPU only gets a bell to ring CPU line you mean the 4 pin 12V plugs Those don't have sense lines only 12V and GND Are you saying that they can must have vdrop detection In the PSU or the receiving device Or were you referring to something else
there's a point where making cables soft cannot be achieved as these cables have to carry a lot of current trough them
Oh I thought seasonic was the best As for corsair I'm surprised I haven't always been a fan of their psus even though I use literally all their other products Always found them to be a bit sketchy Bought an sfx one which was dead
Seems everything is now order on request or pre orders Psus with that specific connector still seem to be few and far between Overclockers have 3 brands 60 are Asus all on pre order So yeah Happy to be proven wrong but you still can't really buy much or anything I'll get one next time or if I need to refund my current psu I just got
Isn't the higher voltage on the grid mainly related to minimizing the power losses over long distances Yes AC attributes to that too but i believe I've read that about the voltage too
Hmph I will do that Thanks for the tip
You can always vertically mount it
Why You're thinking of regular PCI E connectors This adapter does not work the same way
Page 6 of the below guide does a really good job showing how 12VHPWR cables are constructed You can see that the pins when bent horizontally can become loose and in contact with the plastic It looks to me like both the issues in this thread show hard horizontal bends right near the connectors Not to blame the users as the cables should be anchored down and include adhesive or something similar but based on the pics shared in this thread we can see the horizontal bending That looks to have caused the pins to lose their seating and touch the plastic creating the melting One user mounted vertically which normally would work fine With these connectors though I think vertical mounting is going to add too much weight on the connector and be much more likely to have a horizontal bend kink The Gigabyte card in the thread had a near 90 degree bend on the 4th cable going into the adapter Wish they would've reinforced these better Also strange that Intel is not using this on their Arc GPUs if they were a leader in the tech They should answer why they are not using and if they warned NVIDIA of the issue I think this could've been avoided with thicker gauge wiring adhesive bonding to the seating and a hard casing for the first 35mm of cable followed by more flexible cables beyond that point
You can bend it just not until 35mm after the connector
RMA has been now completely processed Just received a new gpu
Y all really are great
Thanks for the info
Because you are talking about giving out free stuff when paying customers have been waiting weeks Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth You get to hold onto my money and product for almost a month and now you wanna virtue signal and give out free stuff Youre just taking advantage of this person's situation for free marketing exposure while ignoring your paying customers It is what it is
How can they issue safe cables when it's an issue with the connector design which is now the standard spec They'd have to recall every 4090 scrap every PCB and get the spec changed
Still doesn't affect the statistics Jesus christ people learn how numbers work before you fear monger
The pre sale is going to help us have exact info on the demand so that we'll be sure to have enough for all of you guys
There will be more info on the 180 adapter later this week
If you're also interested in power monitoring Thermal Grizzly is currently preparing a 180 adapter with an integrated power consumption logger and readout display t 221
Well yeah that's the whole point giving people what they want or need I guess
The cpu power cables doing a 270 degree bend is fairly common This is the fault of the connector design if it is caused by bending something that is designed to bend
x200B
Debunked where by who Plz share I'd like to be up to date
Because I thought everyone in this sub knew this already It is a widely circulated image
I understand that Like I said the glass panel is literally pushing the pins in place The scenario you're describing is impossible in my situation I've been building PCs since 2008 and working on car electronics since 2005 I'm well versed in this type of connector I'm not worried about it
Huh Mine has a little card that was in the box explaining the cable orientation and how not to bend it by the plug
You can't force 5 amps through that resistor just like with the human body acting as a resistor an actual resistor will also limit the current which is determined by the voltage and the resistance current I voltage V resistance R As this was a 330 Ohm resistor 5 manufacturing tolerance we can calculate that the expected current is 50V 330R 0 15A which is also roughly what you can see on the display being drawn If you wanted to increase the current flowing in this setup you would either have to raise the voltage or lower the resistance The 1 amp you're seeing on the display is the current limit but as long as that number isn't reached it doesn't matter if it's set to 0 5 1 or 5 amps Once you do hit the current limit the power supply will start bringing down the output voltage until it reaches the desired current draw A regular piece of wire will have a resistance that is as low as possible This way it doesn't limit the current too much and more importantly the lower the resistance the less power loss you will have That's how you end up with the picture from OP A bad connection most likely caused a higher than normal resistance in the connector This resistance probably wasn't high enough to cause the GPU to stop working but it does cause more power loss which in turn causes the connector to heat up
First of all the link is specific to cablemod's adapter not a general information for that connector That being said it's definitely not untrue and applies to Nvidia's too However it's virtually impossible not to bend it OP's application is applying less strain on it than having it mounted horizontally as I've said before The adapter is simply too bulky and too stiff This isn't OP's fault it's a design flaw
Yeah bending the 4 cables coming out after the plug plenty of slack by the looks of it But why not compare it to a completely different cable product that the OP does not even Just relax it's obviously a defect he'll RMA mount it the same way again and have no issues
View all comments look at the photo
Oh yeah I can already tell what kind of a neckbeard you Mr Black Sadness Endworld rolling on the floor laughing It's amazing how your comment both predates the PC pic AND is wrong yet you assume you're right face with tears of joy
Sure TokeEmUpJohnny lol I'll take your opinions with a shaker of salt thanks
Or using it for productivity and gaming
Actually the people who have bought 4090 s care very much about our money which is why we have enough to happily buy this card which is worth every penny The demographic for the 4090 is different mature gamers who have been gaming for 25 30 years and have enough disposable income to buy this without concern And also professional users of the card for whom time is literally money and competitive advantage requires having up to date technology
There's another photo attached that shows this click the right arrow on the first image to see it
Im not salty I just hate when companies treat their customers like shit knowingly There is a reason EVGA stopped dealing with Nvidia and the key word is disrespect I hate it more when customers cave to such greedy shit We should have some dignity and punish companies when they pull up shit like this Thats all im saying
I mean evidently a lot of people discredited the statement without doing their own research just because it came from someone they didn t like lol
The FE models had them
No worries lol I figured you meant 3090ti
Then I have a fake Gigabyte 3090 ti with the 12 pin then
Not really just make sure everything is connected properly
Thank you very much for explaining and sharing this I've heard of the issues but never looked at how well documented they are It's like the Office with the printer but being on the cable side of the connection it doesn't take the vdrop across the connector itself into consideration Maybe a temp sensor on the PCB cable connector as well Unsure Or even include that circuit on the gpu to use if no atx3 0 detected The remote sense notes referenced the remote sense is used for the CPU control specifically for lower wattage PSUs though I would think the PSU should have remote sense over all high current connectors Even if it's at the PCB connector side to give the PSU the best picture of the environment it's fighting It also lets you monitor temp rise over time to see if that peak happens over 1hr or 10m Even the cable doing that would help Instead of watching for a max limit watch how fast it reaches that limit I'm doing this with 50 ' of high current DC runs Programming out thermal runaway with minimal sensor input has been my focus In my world the remote sense would be the easiest to implement to give the PSU the best health status of the system as a whole not just where the wires exit the enclosure The whole situation sounds odd I get wanting to simplify connectors but why not give the PSU a connection to the motherboard Lol include it in the family instead of treating like a required outsider Would giving a USB Serial connector to plug into the motherboard to enable those features be more difficult than all of this
Indeed however from what i have seen so far the gauge is not that big small
They minimize power losses because increasing the voltage reduces the current needed to deliver the same power and the current is what causes the actual power loss in the wires AC actually has worse transmission losses due to the skin effect
Yes that is the main reason from what people who work in the industry say
Not an option for all cases
I m not thinking about the adapter at all I m talking basic power draw Transient spikes are issues that all Nvidia GPUs including this one have The only thing that separates this cable from a regular pci e cable is an IC that senses voltage per adapter plug and allows more current draw based on that GN went over this It can happen with any cable Just because this is a new standard doesn t make it immune to failure To me what OP s pictures look like is a loose connection with high draw I ve seen it a couple of times on 3ph208v wiring I m guessing OP was excited about his new card put it in quickly not checking for solid connections and went to town Especially if any OC benchmarking was happening The cable not being snug and well seated generates heat and over time can create the exact failure you see here The reason it isn t on the PSU end is that he she was probably less excited to run a psu cable s than when they installed their brand new GPU Edit Another cause could be a manufacturing error on either Nvidia s or Corsair s part Good luck trying to rma as either will just point the finger at the other leaving the consumer in the cold with no gpu and down 2k
I am not physical engineer but 3 5cm is very long then the bend adds more length let's consider a short radius I don't expect the bend to be less than 2cm to not stress these cables too much to be up to specs that's a whole 5 5cm further away from the I can't believe any case would allow to properly fit such GPU I have a meshify 2XL It is not 't be able to fit the GPU in standard mount Vertical 't naturally of DIY to do it 't even plug cables right is either playing ostrich or being careless And it's a frikin 1600 for that damn brick I would personally want it to look neat and not burn my computer
sorry but what you are saying is complete nonsense we have been helping people all the time If you are not happy with the wait then I am more than happy to refund you your money as I said we are working without weekends on it and even during a holiday All cables are done by manual labor of very trained staff that has been doing this for years and we can t just increase the production capacity over night
If you are sending out cables with connectors that melt burn nobody cares what part of it is part of some standard Everything has some sort of standard Whats important is that the thing can be potentially dangerous If its clearly faulty it needs to be replaced Large recalls is not unheard of at large scales I'm not saying a large amount of them are faulty but if they are thats definitely a bill Nvidia is going to have to pick up
Because if it's the issue I discussed it's the cable side not the socket so could be redesigned reinforced Even if it's a problem with the plug standard nothing actually stops them from creating a non standard better plug even working with the standard body to have it as the new standard
Awesome Thanks for the reply Do you know time table of release after pre orders
Are those adapters compatible with the Asus 4090 TUF
When is the 180 adapter coming out approximately I want it for my verical mount
Thanks for posting this This is the document I used to determine how to bend my cable Got a lot of fear mongering replies to my comment and they just make me laugh
It was a popular post in this sub leading up to the release of the 4090 I'm not going to do your homework for you I'm sure you'll find it
Ok Hopefully our conversation can teach someone not as well versed Enjoy that 4090 ya lucky bastard winking face
Dude I'm so worry seeing these posts blowing up pun not intended Mine is arriving at the end of the month Should I vertical mount it I'm intending to put it in a Corsair 4000D case but I saw another post with a Corsair 7000D bigger case that seems to give the gpu more breathing room
Thanks for the explanation So this is where I circle back to the possible 240W USB C if it gets mass adoption basically ensure that we might see electrical goods damaged A friend of mine works in IT related to the NHS here in le UK and he's got stories of mangled ports for days apparently some people force USB plugs into HDMI ports because that's what you do when the plug doesn't go in So I'm just thinking if we're pushing more and more power through these thin cables especially USB let's face it a GPU will be connected once and would we not see electrical damage similar to what happened to the OP
They all have the exact same connection layout on the GPU it will cause issues like this I have a little card sent out with my 4090 that states NOT to do this and it uses the included Nvidia adapter S
No he won't If he keeps bending it horizontally before reaching 40 45mm it will happen again That's exactly why it happened this time It's like you people don't even research this stuff at all
I saw the photo and he clearly bent the cable horizontally right after it exits the GPU connection point
At least I went for something fun rather than emo rolling on the floor laughing
Exactly I'm a 42 YO professional who's been an avid PC gamer since the OG Wolfenstein My wife and I spend our money wisely seldom eat out we're using six year old phones bought our cars used and paid cash etc so that we can save for college for our kids make their Christmas and birthdays special and have disposable income for our respective hobbies It's made easier by the fact that we're both well paid professionals but this notion that the people who are buying these GPUs are irresponsible stupid spendthrifts is 100 sour grapes and it makes me laugh and cringe every time I see it
Ah BTW looks like someone got a similar issue to yours Did you try the fix that he found at the end of his post here
Jay got the info straight from Nvidia but that's besides the point We all have limited time We choose how to use that limited time I'm not going to spend my valuable time vetting every piece of information from every single person If some people have a history of bad information I'm not going to waste my precious time checking to see whether or not ANYTHING they say is worthwhile I'd rather spend that time on trust worthy sources Jay is not relevant to me and is actually on my block list He's annoying In That's it
Weird I wonder why these issues are just popping up
Wait So those cable burned because they didnt connect it properly
is the card still usable
I came across some schematics for the two not sense pinse that I had forgotten I had seen It still doesn't reveal the specs for what would make a GPU send the PWR SENSE signal or what the PSU does with it Larger version of the two diagrams shown in the previous pic
You're welcome I think you're overthinking this or over estimating how much complexity PC System Integrators need or are willing to tolerate think the Dell Lenovos and server manufacturers of the world PSUs are generally speaking oversized to ensure there is capacity for transients without nuking caps or turning off I'm not sure what the PSU communicating vdrop speed of temperature increase etc to the motherboard would bring to the table other than perhaps slimming the margin of needed extra capacity Implementation of the two ATX 3 0 sense pins are still a pretty great step forward The CARD CBL PRES presence pin let's the PSU inform the device of it's available capacity depending on how many devices are connected PWR STABL lets the device inform the PSU if it's getting fed bad power and ask for a shutdown Again I don' know the specs for this but there's no reason to assume that Nvidia hasn't implemented this detection in a full and good way The circuitry just isn't utilized externally unless using a full ATX 3 0 PSU But it's possible even likely the information generated is used internally say to cut power or initiate a crash TDR However there probably isn't a temperature sensor near the power connector at this time by the look of things o And yes there are relaxed rules for ATX 3 0 PSUs of 450W Realistically everything below that has been working just fine for 1 2 decades incl PCIe 6 8 pin connectors
That's a logical reply Thanks for being respectful unlike the others It's indeed possible and highly likely that a loose connection was the cause But that said going by Corsairs own recommendation they do not recommend a 1000W PSU with their own proprietary adapter But instead recommend 1200W We are all just trying to figure out what's going on here Any information is helpful
How are you going to refund my time wasted and the time you held onto my money You gonna pay interest with that Don't try to excuse your behavior on here You used this person situation to your own benefit If you wanted to help him you could have messaged him privately instead of taking advantage of him to advertise yourself and your products all while ignoring your customer base
I'm not sure at this time we'll definitely have more info after the pre sale starts
Yep they are We will have a compatibility list available in time for launch
Planning to announce it officially this week and do a pre sale like the 90 degree adapter you'll know more in a few days
It was a development document shared b w partners working on the new Power plug Highlighting flaws in the design
Hopefully This thread is getting a lot of attention
It's important to note that 240W USB C connectors already exist it's the same USB C connector we've been using for years The good news is that a USB power supply will not put out 48V to begin with It's limited to 5V at a maximum of 900mA by default according to the specification although many cheaper chargers ignore this current limit There then needs to be a successful handshake before the charger starts outputting a higher voltage at the request of the device This at least ensures the cable is mostly electrically intact and connected to the right port device We've had a few years of testing with devices mostly laptops that draw 100W over USB C in the form of 20V and 5A the same amount of current used to achieve 240W and I'm not aware of any significant damages to devices as a result of this As the current isn't increasing any more than what it already was it doesn't really make a difference to the cable or the connector
that states NOT to do this Cool story we know this Your point
You sound like when Apple blamed people for holding their iPhone4 wrong face with tears of joy It's clearly a bad design and this particular unit is defective The chances of this happening again to the same person are statistically LOW despite your intellectual brain telling you otherwise Take a breather maybe take your five finger gf out for a spin
Get your eyes checked It's a gentle bend as far as power cables go
Blacksad is a cat detective from a famous comic book actually lol Again you're simply uninformed Hardly surprising at this point
My first system was the NES maybe 1987 or 88 I ve tried to put away the habit a few times in my life but I ve come to accept that I m a gamer and I love it The 4090 is a phenomenal card but requirements for entry are different and higher than those in the past
This pretty much nails it Signed another middle aged gamer who also grew up playing OG Wolfenstein 3D and Ace of Aces
it makes me laugh and cringe every time I see it Funny Your face elicits that exact same reaction Edit Please don t downvote me Pattywhack is my husband and I m just here to bust his balls He s very handsome and I love him dearly
If you want to know the exact fix without clicking on that link then it's setting the Windows Power Setting called PCI Express Link State Power Management setting to OFF
Well yeah exactly Those who aren t going to spend the time to research something are uninformed and shouldn t share an opinion
The new dongle piece from the 4090 also takes 3 external connections and it appears more fragile than the prior models nbsp There was plenty of bitching on this sub 2 years ago but that was mostly on why the dongle was even needed And from some YT reviewers who wondered why this was needed on the lower power draw cards nbsp Now the criticism is more on the poor design
Essentially yes You have to plug the cable in all the way in and it s admittedly difficult I think someone at nvidia said to use some electrical grease or something no joke
I really do appreciate you sharing this That's something I might dig into a little more even if it's reaching out to them direct I could easily see me expanding into this market now that I understand the issues a little bit I'm very curious to see what the standard implementation is over various mfgs and how it's used by each component L Does the system driver register a change when those lines are fucked with Getting a 4090 might have to happen business write off lol To give some backstory years ago I was in the Transform the Smartphone contest Motorola did Mine was a BLe mesh network that used temp and humidity to create an energy profile of the home and create schedules based on identifying who's in the house ant what times Each person and tech object create a very specific energy profile in temp and humidity increase that I was able to identify over time This ended up basically getting made into the Sevenhugs smart remote X but without home utility integration I was not involved with that implementation though I made others but Motorolas lack of commitment to the platform showed it was dead so I kept my company a Thermal R D company and reviewed all the data I had data from current sensors on each breaker custom water heaters and boiler controls radiant heat loop calculations etc and what I hated most was having to reverse engjneer each companies design decisions because it always came back to obfuscating data creating market segments or just laziness from lack of competition The efficiency lost in devices because of cheap business decisions killed me Esp after going through the effort of getting that chip to last 10yrs in 2 coin cells Every design decision had a direct effect on longevity and I found a lot of it was from expected temp rise in the connectors They are designed to run hot but that means loss of efficiency If the energy is converted to heat it can't be used for anything else in the system So as for me being Loud Im trying I ended up designing a fully scalable solution to expose this issue I've got a few patents pending on the design and control methods to do what I'm talking about and it's taking me a lot to not share more now Ill update this in a few months when we launch but until then I'm still under gag order lol This seems like a good area to dig into next though Edit The fix is essentially bringing industrial design to consumer products But industrial products create value consumer products create emotions Industrial design doesn't suffer from these same issues because fit form takes a backseat to function Edit 2 and the thermal pic with the temp probe on the cable vs the board is what I meant with knowing that rise time being important Id be embarrassed if I shipped something like that knowings it's standard use would cause issues And Edit 3 my take on the temp rise in the connector is essentially the same phenomenon that lets Peltier coolers work So I'd be curious what material they used in the plug side The connector states copper alloy but even from the cable to the connector to the PCB youre creating hot spots and cool spots that are the differential based on Peltier efficiency formulas based on material selections I could be wrong but even the thermal pic shows that The difference in materials inhibits energy transfer If the connector and board were thermally bonded that temp rise wouldnt be an issue because the heat would have somewhere to escape The easy fix is larger connectors with higher current ratings because they have more mass or surface area to bond the connection better The HPwr stuff usually is just a specific pin coating or material changing mass without changing physical dimensions vs more surface area I'm assuming Nvidias supplier had old stock of non hpwr pins and assumed eh 9A is still more than we need ship if anyway and didn't consider the materials mismatch Could also explain the randomness in testing based on who assembled it
Oh I'm absolutely overthinking this lol It's kind of what I do but also something I deal with everyday so when I get a chance to have a devil's advocate I try to take advantage The server side is actually where I started with the PMBus years ago On the server side you get almost complete control and health monitoring of the physical system Lose worn connectors can be identified individual component failure can be easier identified depending how the supplies are integrated and I can shut down and run Troubleshooting code to test for various fault conditions before I ever head out I get in consumer products that shouldn't be an issue The connectors though the connectors are the only reason I have to do most of that work and are typically the failure A weak connection will almost immediately show a current spike or temp rise rapidly vs over time If the PSU could detect this it could throw a cable fault code or some shit I like the way the connector looks 1 more pair prob would have avoided this completely set screws like older connectors or shit Car audio has been running thick wire for decades Let us connect 6 awg wire from the PSU to the GPU
That's awesome It's always nice seeing wholesome gestures like that with everything else going wrong in the world today I hope your patrons are enjoying getting to use the GPU and the new keyboards
Hey man glad to see the gaming Cafe is still going strong Hope everything is well
That's amazing Happy to see this
Damn playing in a gaming cafe was some of my best memories Like 15 years ago They all closed now
Kid is gaming on a keyboard that is more expensive than 99 of us have lmao
Do they have the psu strong enough for that i wonder
Awesome Game on
Bro that's awesome I remember your post about opening the cafe I wish you the best of luck
Hey my man Keep it up Best thing I've seen today And kudos to the person who sent it to you
Hmm I have a 2080 just chillin in my shed I wouldn t mind sending over
Wholesome af
How can we donate
I saw this picture last year
At least they stopped him from screen peaking
It s awesome to see pc gaming spreading all over the world victory hand
Ma sha Allah brother have fun
Very cool
That s fucking sick My earliest memories of gaming are going to a pc cafe in MX
Yep I know what I'll read when I sort by Controversial
Remember seeing a post about the cafe a while back Hope you yours and all the kids are doing well brother
Humanity at its best
This is awesome I think gaming is a great way to help people escape their reality I can imagine these kids being the happiest when they re able to spend some time in your cafe
hello thank you for sharing this those smiles are radiating so much happiness to me too purple heart
Always an eye on the fps counter
That s amazing Thanks for sharing hope you guys have fun gaming
You already shared this photo 4 months ago Farming karma
Smiling for both cameras
Is Chandler there
That's greats Happy to see this
That's awesome man If you don't kind sharing what's the typical specs of the systems you currently have
There are too many brain dead comments in this uplifting post Where the fuck are the mods
Awesome That s a good card Enjoy
Hell ya enjoy
Someone has been looking at the minimap a bit too much on those ultrawides
Glad to see that internet cafes still exist
Cool wall art in the back
Glad to see your cafe going strong
Shame about the monitor though It looks maybe faulty and I can only hope has a high enough Hz rate
red heartred heart
Send me an rtx whatever as well
I consider myself to be a logic driven middle aged guy who doesn't fall prey to emotional heart string stuff on the internet but damn me if this didn't bring a tear to my eye Good show old man
How many times will you spam the same post Blocked
Must be something to play Battlefield in the same country as you can do it for real
That guy needs a squint surgery
Pennywise
What game is the kid playing I can t make it out
70 30
Not wanting to be a scrooge here But if the business is struggling or a non profit I'm 100 behind the gesture If it's actually doing alright Not so much Would of been better donating it to an after school program no matter where it's located IMHO
ayo im in turkey and stuck with an rx580 someone gimme a hand too
I thought they were still having a civil war or something They don't seem starving though
Congrats on the new hardware Sorry it had to come from someone who embraces nazi terminology
always asking for free handouts if the cafe is doing so well why not pay for it themselves I m guessing they are typing a begging post for the 4000 series rn
100 they are going to mine on it and then sell it for 200
Awesome Is this in Sana'a
My guy using a Corsair VOID PRO Elite respect It's a bit heavy but very comfortable and has great sound for a gaming headset
Thats wholesome as heck have a great time slightly smiling face
Yeah man
Happy gaming to our fellow Yemeni friends
That's awesome man super happy to see your Cafe is still up and running
This makes my heart happy
Fuck yeah long live gaming Just make sure the kids get to share properly
Awww I love this
Nice
This made my day Though I m in the US I m originally Palestinian and remember my young days going to the Internet cafe for fun I m happy to see this and would love to here more about opportunities to donate to Internet cafes worldwide as a community
A G915 in a cafe in Yemen Damn
Love this Im sure the kids appreciated this a lot
Wholesome
AMAZING Introducing local children to the wonders of gaming
Is it my turn
Damn is awesome that they qre having fun considering the horrible war they have been victims whish them nothing but entire nights playing games '
This make me happy
Awesome hope it brings many of your patrons many hours of fun
That is awesomely wholesome
I sadly know nothing about yemen but i wanna go there
This is old as hell
I need to stay updated on this internet cafe Story for the ages Wholesome and amazing
thanks
Yeah People coming together to play cs on lan
Still very popular in countrys where the economy is horrible yemen etc
I love how this is a nice comment and then in the the keyboard elitists reply go nuts not realizing they re commenting on a post where a guy from fucking Yemen was gifted stuff The privilege is fucking unreal
And as an owner I can tell you it's not worth it The battery is shit 2w top with RGB but with battery saving enabled the range with the lightspeed mode is atrocious the keycaps rattle the rubber keys are even flimsier and worst of all the app that controls it fucking sucks balls if it even starts up Did I mention this 250usd MSRP keyboard doesn't even include a wrist rest in the box or dual Bluetooth device functionality And that you'll be hitting the G keys on the left side accidentally a LOT of times Y
I promise the keyboard rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than oem keyboards
Agree thats keyboard is also my dream
I'd also not recommend it to anyone thinking of buying one The keys are quite mushy for mechanicals
't you just be happy for those kids You're on a 4090 and complaining about the few donated keyboards p
I'm still chillin with a 4 year old wired Red Dragon Kumara K552 keyboard and a wired Red Dragon Impact M908 mouse You can get both of those from the website for about 80 after shipping
Hey its me ur brother with the internet caf
a friend set up a gofundme
all is well bro
lmao i'm going to hell for this
I don't care honestly The dude is doing a service to these kids in a war torn country by allowing them to learn computer skills and to play games they normally wouldn't have the chance to So what if he reposts some pictures in search of donations
Maybe he didn t know about r NVIDIA then and wanted to share now
Who fucking cares This guy is spending his time and energy bringing joy to children How does that affect you He deserves all the praise and karma Bless those who nurture the future even when they have so little to offer Go touch grass
why was this downvoted guy is clearly farming karma and trying to get more free gpus
bruh
Damn bro do you always make your parents proud like this
not good bro
core i5 4th gen 8gb ram
you need to see a psychiatrist
Did you tell your mother this joke as well
it works well just the weird in the picture
you need to see a psychiatrist
gta 5 i think or spiderman
Hey there's something nice i wonder if I can shit on it Fosteredlol
One of the most creative jokes I ever seen loudly crying face
Yemen is one of the most war torn places on the planet School my ass these kids are lucky their town isn t under some sort of attack right now
Are you aware what is happening in Yemen right now He is offering a safe space for people to escape a literal conflict The currency has tanked there are major blackouts life sounds pretty awful over there currently if he is making a bit of money himself off it or not which I doubt based on how things are and how he s spoken about the business and if he s making a little so what he still needs to make money he is still doing a great service to his community As somebody who plays games and lives a privileged life imagine what losing your ability to practise your hobby would make you feel probably a little sucky Then add a civil war famine and zero sense of stability to that
It's 'would have' never 'would of' Rejoice for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot
I'm sorry but would have
Dude people in need are just that people in need It doesn't matter who they are a very kind person donated amazing gifts to these people and these people obviously are greatful for it It was a nice gesture so just leave it at that
I have no words as to how this kind of ignorance comes to be Generally expect higher quality from a technically inclined subreddit like this Holy fuck man just Google Yemen and then thank your privilege you're several thousand miles away from it I M H O Have some empathy for your fellow goddamn human This has to be rage bait
Yeah this money could be better spent on some chromebooks and copies of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Then they can just automate clean water economic stability and societal peace
Capitalism has rotted your brain if you think kids in a war torn country don't deserve fun just because a business might not be doing well
You do realize it's not a city state
bro you need to see a psychiatrist
No I don't think I know what you mean elaborate in detail
Someone who embrace what What does it mean
Weird ass comment
Your comment screams 'miserable to be around'
I agree All children should be in factories
Mining is fucking dead lmao
For sure Why would anyone need 3070s better to send numerous more smaller but still good for gaming cards like 1050ti
will do
nothing better than gaming
glad to hear have a nice day
keyboard elitists Had the displeasure to be in contact with them elitists before Something seriously wrong with those particular 's a keyboard that was gifted yet they can't seem to take a hint they HAVE to tear it all apart
As a owner of the G915 TKL I find the keyboard totally worth it No RGB Last recharged 2 months ago battery still at 70 I game every single day No issues with rattling unless you vigorously shake the keyboard don't know why one would do that Lightspeed connection has been flawless since Day 1 For me this keyboard has served me very well and I hope it continues that way Purchased it 2 years ago
Yeah just the USB being micro is enough to never buy or recommend this product in my eyes
As an owner too i'll give my piece aswell Battery lasts 3 weeks with rgb at 50 dims to 25 after 1min off after a few I find 3w of battery for 2 3hrs of charge to be absolutely fine I never had any issue with Ghub not once I have heard other people complaining though I dont randomly hit G keys That was a bit odd And keyboard is so low profile that i personally dont find it uncomfortable not having a wrist rest I do agree tho that keycaps stability is really bad and that the media buttons feel super cheap I cant speak for range as i only bring it to my lap while being on my chair and never had any issues as its only like 60cm away from the dongle Lastely i do agree that microUSB is dumb and annoying My fix to this is to use one singular magnetic cable and have the various bits stay in the devices i use micro usb bits for my keyboard mouse g pro and headset hyperx cloud flight S usb c in my phone That way i never have to actually plug things in while fearing of breaking them Screw micro usb But magnetic cable with all the bits was like 15 All in all i'm really happy with the keyboard i like the very low key travel time actuation time and the long lasting battery for a keyboard with RGB Its probably also helping that i paid 147 for it
Which keyboard is this
That's the wired G815 and not the G915 in the image The wired one doesn't have all the wireless issues I got it or 99 105 USD for reference here in Germany on sale It's honestly decent Sure one can get some other nice keyboards for the same price but wanting a QWERTZ style layout AND a numberpad it's honestly not that bad One can replace the keycaps on other keyboards but that's also additional cost and I really prefer the QWERTZ ISO layout enter and shift keys
I think the keyboard in question is actually the G815 wired variant judging by the cable thickness I was lucky enough to get one for 170 AUD on sale otherwise 329 AUD retail which is absolutely insane slap on another 100 if you want the G915 To me this would be a perfect keyboard if the dogshit G HUB software wasn't a necessity to fiddle around with settings
Coworker has had his for less than a year and two keys have gone out for him already On the bright side they just sent out a replacement and told him to junk the old one which he's going to attempt to fix
I have that keyboard without the 10key and yes it is absolute garbage I ended up hardwiring it at all times cause the battery is trash Lots of double presses and shit too man
Keep your money and buy a keyboard that's 10x better for a fraction of the price lol
Which keyboard is it
He doesn't really have a tone implying he isn't happy I think it's more just being sarcastic Even though it's not my laptop keyboard is the best I've ever owned
Hey its me ur brother with the internet caf
Great
Rich jealous self centered muricans can't possibly understand what it's like to be poor let alone live in Yemen And if they're not rich they're just fucked in the head
You can see in his post history that he did I'm not saying the OP is bad necessarily But I have some level of scepticism As I said in other posts don't get me wrong he's doing a good thing for the kids But reposting the same content from 4 months ago saying that a Redditor has donated 't know where the hardware is going we know this one photo exists of a guy holding a box
Exactly that and there's plenty of people in here falling for it
I meant both smiling for the camera stupid auto correct
Not a bad idea actually she would probably find it hilarious
I'm curious what you would diagnose me with Seriously try it
Man that place's government does something bad Man lemme take a jab at a random citizen who is literally showing appreciation decency and social situation awareness that I clearly lack
I have now improved my comment face with tears of joy
Thanks face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
Send kids caught in a conflict super expensive 3070s You can play most games fine on a Gtx 1650 Multiple 1650s for the price of a single 3070 Heck I used to use a gt 1030 and I m nowhere near a war zone Bigger issues than gaming for them I would think
I just imagine views like these happen because the people in OP and similar are struggle and can't get help There's There's poor people all over America why help Yemen without admitting America's government fed state and local has the means to help their poor people they just don't
This is your assumption Change the colour of their skin and their location to say Alaska and you wouldn't being getting so hyped up about it I live on the North west coast of Canada and we have a ton of isolated indigenous communities that haven't had clean drinking water for years And my original comment wasn't about their conditions anyway It was about the fact that donating PC parts to a profitable business isn't really all that virtuous no matter who it is and where they're located So my reaction is meh
The entire nation is covered by Saudi Air range or partisans offence I know there are many downvotes but that's alright since most redditor are never heard about Yemen first Just trying to put a genuine question
PCMR means PC Master Race Master Race is Nazi terminology which they used to claim that white people are superior to all other people EDIT judging by the downvotes it seems like there's a whole lot of people in denial in this community
Pc master race is a rebuke of nazis It's literally using the concept as a parody Holy fuck this is stupid
why are you being such a miserable prick Because HE didn't get a GPU Obviously You can always pick out the miserable under developed man children by the jealousy they express towards other people's gifts and donations
You go contact the donor and tell them that the kind donation they sent was bad value Go do that
I dont understand keyboard elitism Keyboard is keyboard Why we gotta be so picky
Same thing here It ended with me being insulted by using a Cheeto dust covered keyboard because I didn't own a 450 custom keyboard It was an absolute joke and personally makes me not want to get one Corsair k55 does the job just as good if not good enough Those folk ain't ever entering an Esports championship but they have literally nothing else to care about but a keyboard of all things
I also have the TKL and agree with everything here I run the rgb at the lowest setting and still only have to charge once a month Absolutely love it
I have the same KB My complaint is the keycaps quality and the sound it makes The caps feel a bit flimsy and since they have a bit of lateral play it makes a bad sound if you're not really on the key before it presses Otherwise the form factor and board sturdiness is great Wireless is rock solid never ever had a single issue with lightspeed It always connects instantly But the RGB brightness is not as great as my older wired Logi KB and doesnt cover the special characters on the number row which is really disappointing
I have the same I love everything about it except the coating or plastic type of the keycaps I had to order a replacement set cause I had multiple keys with the legends scratched off after about a year
Idk how tf this dude is accidentally hitting the G keys they are so far off to the side lmao
My fix to this is to use one singular magnetic cable and have the various bits stay in the devices i use micro usb bits for my keyboard mouse g pro and headset hyperx cloud flight S usb c in my phone Do you have a link to this cable
I also paid the same but used MSRP as a reference because most ppl got it at that price 2 3y ago
Logitech G915 for Wireless and G815 for wired
I got the G815 for 99 154 AUD for reference here in Germany on sale It's honestly decent Sure one can get some other nice keyboards for the same price but wanting a QWERTZ style layout AND a numberpad it's honestly not that bad One can replace the keycaps on other keyboards but that's also additional cost and I really prefer the QWERTZ ISO layout enter and shift keys
You could be right but placement seeems in line with g915 USB G hub sucks so
I switched to Ducky after owning 3 corsairs and man I should have done this shit way sooner No dogshit rgb software No loose keycaps Every macro and keyboard setting is on board One day I'll build one for sure
Hey its me ur brother with the internet caf
While I don't disagree with your statement about Americans I'm not American
Redditors probably send him more things every time these posts go viral Very smart on his end
To be honest your quite right in The end of the day we don t know the guy could be a Marge vs the monorail I haven t personally looked into it if it s legit edit 1 I ve looked into he s post history he seems fairly legit but take what I say with a grain of salt just posts about the internet cafe and a couple other things like for example can you help me find this dell laptop then I might throw a fiver away maybe I m broke but If people want to throw money at this guy then it s your money and those are your life choices go ahead Out of curiosity hey u maho90 can you explain this
I understand he's doing a nice thing for children over there Sure thats great and all But he did post this months ago with the same image so one way or the other its either farming karma or getting free products Sure if someone wants to send free products that is fine But with some level of scepticism not all of this hardware may end up where we expect it to go Thank you for agreeing though
And I'm sure the money I donated is gonna do more good in this world now than the booze I was gonna blow it on Who gives a fuck if he reposts
Sociopathy
Way to look a gift horse in the mouth What do you care what someone else sent Send one yourself if you are so concerned about what other people donate then talk about how you nailed that donation value
Yes maybe 1650s would be better for the use case but still somebody wanted to donate it A lot of people in the comments donate spare parts they have maybe somebody upgrades to a 40 series or something And what is gaming for you An escape from your day to day life A form of time for you to be alone It s not like what they are going through is a natural disaster they can run from military clashes that have been going on for a very long time probably the duration of some of these kids lives They deserve the downtime
Fully agree with you Send them food rations or something Really don't understand the downvotes
They do help they provide weapons and God knows what for this proxy war s
So my reaction is meh Good thing almost nobody gives a fuck about what you think so you can safely shove it up where the sun don't shine
Well doesn't mean everyone goes hungry all the time though I imagine coastal cities have better access to humanitarian aid
Just trying to put a genuine retarded question Fixed it for ya thumbs up You have the mental capacity to understand that things still function in places of conflict right People don't just lay down on the floor and give up doing everything On top of that there are kind people out there helping out be it food finances or gifts to entertain ALL are needed to keep the morale up Don't be a stereotypical callous chinese
It is a concept and phrase much older than Nazism And I wouldn't say that just because someone subscribes to pcmr they embrace Nazi terminology
You're a crazy person
EDIT judging by the downvotes it seems like there's a whole lot of people in denial in this community Judging by your constant bickering you seem to be unable to separate jokes from reality history It's ok idiots seem to get by well these
There's ALWAYS that one person
Right so start using swastikas ironically and see how people will take that Also they're not using the term ironically They're using it because they literally think pc is better than all other platforms They're using it the same way the nazis did
There are hundreds of useful things they could've sent Those 3070s are gonna be mined on for sure
Arguably mechanical keyboard are superior to normal keyboards for feeling and speed as a previous Starcraft 2 player
I got something that will really make them angry I don't even use a keyboard I use a Razer Tartarus shields face
Note I didn't complain about the connection reliability Even under bluetooth it connects really fast and there's near 0 lag My issue is with the lightspeed range and namely how easy it gets blocked It's incredible it gets so easily blocked over 2 4ghz at short range
My only complaints are that Logitech didn t use USB C and the volume dial isn t tactile They aren t that major but given the cost Logitech could have made the keyboard a little more premium
Only on French amazon and it appears to not be available anymore I believe they have newer versions though I bought this one because the connector is flat while new ones are round i thought it might raise the phone when its laying flat ive had this for 8 months and so far good as new Its also a pack of 3 so there's that They also have longer cables i ended up buying a longer one for my headset so i can use it while charging
Thank you
I think there's also a TKL version of the 815 so if you really don't care for numeric pad or are sensitive about space and the ergonomics of having the mouse closer the TKL is better for you
G815 has it in the same spot
Not to burst your bubble if you're enjoying your Ducky but Ducky is known for doing the same thing Overly expensive bad build quality I've had two that didn't even come together properly cheaping out on keycaps that fade within a couple months and terrible customer support on top For proper good quality entry level keyboards I'd suggest Epomaker or Keychron
Hey my brothers ur being silly it s me ur oldest brother with the internet caf
Lmao that helps your case immensely Let me correct it You're a Rich jealous self centered muricans person who can't possibly understand what it's like to be poor let alone live in Yemen And if they're you're not rich they're you're just fucked in the head This has to be a self own on your part xD
Sociopaths have low impulse control Mine's pretty good
They deserve education to Then again I guess playing cod at max settings will prepare them for the real world where they live
Yes because we ALL know that food rations are be all end all Hobbies and entertainment especially escapism are not important to human beings Right I understand the downvotes completely because the comment is tone deaf Some idiot saw a thing that would bring a bit of joy and excitement to children nah bruh gotta tear that shit apart Ludicrous jealous callous gamerzzzztrade mark as
Yep Makes no sense to send gaming equipment to a war zone Gaming is not a necessity and there are many other things you can do to distract kids from reality
I imagine
So is the swastika yet we don't use that anymore for good reason And even disregarding that there was never a good use of the term master race It implies superiority over other races Invoking racism to claim superiority of PC is obviously not something that should be viewed positively
What I said is literally true How am I crazy Looking by the downvotes it seems like there's some people in denial in here
So what if it's a joke It's a bad joke What if people started wearing swastikas everywhere and said LOLz you don't get the joke U thats not how it works If something represents hatred then using it as a joke just makes you disrespectful of the devastation that thing has caused Just saying something is a joke doesn't excuse it
My 50 Logitech wireless keyboard that i got at Nebraska Furniture mart 3 years ago has been working and feeling great for me lol I do use a wired mouse though A good wired mouse definitely makes a very discernable difference over a cheap one I've tried several of my friends' expensive high end elitist keyboards before By far the most noticeable difference is how much louder they are than a regular keyboard as well as the pretty lights They definitely feel different but i honestly cant say they feel any better or worse than my cheaper keyboard It just feels like a keyboard but louder I simply can't feel enough of a difference to justify spending 150 300 on a keyboard Thats just me though To each their own
Ah yes I wasn't contradicting your experience It was just my overall review My M KB always had uninterrupted line of sight maybe 1 5m 5ft to the receivers so I haven't encountered your issues
I'm extremely happy with my purchase and did my dd before buying Thanks though
Entry level keyboards lol Maybe on an enthusiast level compared to the high end custom boards but generally speaking those are not entry level keyboards This elitist fucking bullshit is annoying as hell and I'm typing it on Mode65 with U4Tx switches
I'm well aware of this Doesnt change the fact that it's all trash Also as I said macros are onboard too So I dont need the trash corsair shit for that either
DONT LISTEN TO THEM THERE ALL BLOODY IMPOSTERS IM THE BROTHER WITH AN INTERNETCAFE
Well considering it took you 7 hours to come up with that reply Did you have to ask someone to help But no the only point you got correct was that I don't know what its like to live in Yemen I imagine you don't either I don't see how my comment regarding karma farming trigged you to these points though perhaps you have some agression issues you should work on Meanwhile flexing your 4090FE and 3090FE while having a dig at people about being rich
And yet your comment is here for all to see So it was by choice rolling on the floor laughing
It s not just a fucking war zone people live there There is a war but also peoples homes Honestly the nations that creates half of these conflicts are so fucking ignorant not this one directly though impressive and see things in such a binary way War happening All must ditch everything and LIVE IN FEAR This war has been happening for nearly a decade it becomes part of their lives Let them have their escapism
You're just as racist The concept of races is something mainly used in English speaking countries and by the Nazis Here you are claiming something as silly as fun banter about electronics is using Nazi terminology yet you're doing it yourself Races as per scientific definition do not exist and are an outdated social construct based on pseudoscience and fascism Meanwhile you're talking about races and racism as if races were a real thing I can tell you one thing if you were over here in Germany where I live saying something about races most of us would definitely not want to talk to you Using such archaic and discriminatory and unscientific terminology such as races whilst complaining about a subreddit's name You are the pinnacle of hypocrisy and ignorance
Go touch grass
Maybe you dont use it with your pea sized worldview but other cultures still use it without being Nazi sympathizers Hinduism Buddhism etc Go read a book
Go take a shower
You're comparing something as innocent and wholesome as a computer enthusiasts community in a thread that is literally about kindness and helping the people in need from other countries in the world to a Nazi concept that it's been dead for many decades now intent matters and literally nobody thinks of Aryan racial hierarchy when they visit r PCMR let alone embracing it but you're already aware of that and instead chose to ignore all of it and have a your pathetic little Heyyy notice how much I'm better than all of you guys morally momwnt grow up
What if people started wearing swastikas everywhere Nice strawman but that's not how argumentation works You don't get it Karen
Many if not most of non mechanical keyboards have a thing where they don t register more than 4 5 keystrokes at a time You can try and press a bunch of keys at the exact same time and see that it always doesn t register every key stroke If you do it on most mechanical keyboards it will record every single stroke every time no matter how many keys you pressed at once While I agree that expensive keyboards just become ridiculous past a certain point but there definitely is a legitimate reason why people use them
I don't get what's elitist My current Epomaker cost less than 75 That's cheaper than any gaming keyboard brand talking the Corsairs Razers Logitechs etcc I'm aware brands like Red Dragon and CM exist as well as Ducky for higher quality and no bullshit attached I'd like you to point out in my comment where the elitist remarks are if you wouldn't mind
brother you are not well i will tell mom to fix
Well considering it took you 7 hours to come up with that reply People have lives outside of the computer Must be an alien concept to you Meanwhile flexing your 4090FE and 3090FE while having a dig at people about being rich I'm not the one being a dick about some keyboards
That's a good one Bravo
Races as per scientific definition do not exist and are an outdated social construct based on pseudoscience and fascism You realize how completely and utterly idiotic you sound right now Race is a widely accepted categorization of humanity that deals with a person's history of nationality skin color and other social elements It has nothing to do with specific genetic markers but it is one of many ways humans self identify themselves Along with other things like religion gender and sexual orientation it is a protected class and any prejudice against someone based on race is internationally accepted as a hate crime As much as I wish we could just pretend the concept of race doesn't exist because the world would have been a much better place if that concept was never invented it is literally one of the ways the vast majority of the people in the world identify themselves and being ignorant of that can also be construed as a hate crime in many contexts I was RESPONDING to a subreddit that specifically calls itself the master race I was saying anybody using that terminology is making use of a term used by war criminals based on concepts rooted in ideas that are internationally accepted as hate crimes In addition to your flawed logic you are self contradicting Somehow it's wrong for me to point out the hateful history of a term yet it's totally okay for people to call themselves the Master Race Talk about being intentionally obtuse
How is what I said irrelevant It's basically exactly the same thing Using symbolism used by nazis in some form of attempt at parody Whether it's an image or a phrase it's the same thing It's disrespectful to the history
Unless you need that huge n key rollover why care Neither me nor my missis ever had problems gaming on cheap random keyboards though I've had my Corsair K95 the 18 macro model since 2016 It's common wisdom that a good mouse and a cheap keyboard is a MUCH better combo than the other way around because keyboards don't mean that much let's not kid ourselves here
YER A BLOODY GPUNONCE YEU ARE ARENT YA BLOODY PRINCE ANDREW EYEING UP ME GPU GET YER GRABBY HANDS OFF OF IT WE CAN SPLIT THE GPU IN FOUR HALVES
Literally google human races definition biology social construct You're contradicting yourself It's a social construct mainly used by Americans nowadays It's not based on scientifically supported terminology within human biology Just because some people around the world have not kept up with the times doesn't excuse the absolute buffoonery of said terminology Race is not a thing that exists and making social categories because you're too lazy to acknowledge that a human just looks slightly different is peak arrogance Ethnicity on the other hand is a thing
It's a social construct I literally said exactly that So what So is gender identity and yet society still recognizes that it's an absolute real thing because it's part of how people see themselves It is important to recognize the aspects that people see in themselves just as it is important not to discriminate based on those things
It's a completely different topic I love whataboutism Gender is something you choose for yourself and only affects yourself Gender wasn't historically used to justify superiority over people sex and race were Gender always has meant exactly that Race has not always meant what some people use it as today and still doesn't for most people The only reason most people mainly Americans use it is because they don't know any better and are not taught that it is in fact a social construct and the entire use of it makes absolutely zero sense in regards to identity and only further categorizes people into boxes based on their phenotypes You see in Europe we don't categorize people into races like black or white The absurdity of such limiting words and constructs is baffling to the point that the mere use of it by sheer necessity conveys a limiting view of a person Nazis still use the word race today Americans do Sometimes the English do Most of us on Earth instead just call people by their name or describe them literally based off of their appearance if we don't know any better Because guess what the word was born in discrimination meant to be used for discrimination and to differentiate people by visual appearance Like white The fk does that mean That's most of Europe So they're all the same Yeah go ahead and tell an Austrian or a swiss he's the same as a German because of his skin color let's see you leave without a bloody nose Y'all just tryin to be anti discrimination you don't recognize the discrimination that you're giving off yourself How about you don't categorize people based off of their appearance at all How about you just call Jonathan or Samantha by their name instead of their skin color And by your definition if somebody told me he considers himself Arian which by the very point you're trying to make you'd be like Nice dude I am happy for you and it's cool that you see that in yourself Get the fk outta here You're interpreting scientific definitions at will to fit your agenda whenever it suits you You're an insult to every academic out there working hard every day trying to make objective observations and then making it clear and concise for self loathing advocates of humanity like you only for you to make of it whatever you want and add or subtract what you feel like I'm done fk off Nazi
It's a completely different topic I love whataboutism Gender is something you choose for yourself and only affects yourself Gender wasn't historically used to justify superiority over people sex and race were Gender is something that's actively being used to discriminate today Discrimination in a different way yes but still a form of hate The only reason most people mainly Americans I have no idea where you get the idea that it's mostly Americans because that could even remotely be close to the truth The vast majority of people on the earth identify with some racial background You see in Europe we don't categorize people into races like black or white That's bullshit When there's a white person you call them a white person If there's an Asian person you call them an Asian person It's something we use for the sake of being able to be useful in the way we describe people Like white The fk does that mean Okay so I know you're trolling now How about you don't categorize people based off of their appearance at all If simply using descriptive words is what you mean by categorizing you admitted as such to doing so yourself That's all it is Words that you cna use to be able to describe people If there's a room of 99 white people and one black person do you just say that guy over there or do you say that black guy over there Of course you use the second because it makes it obvious who you're talking about in as little words as possible Simply describing someone is not saying anything positive or negative about them And by your definition if somebody told me he considers himself Arian which by the very point you're trying to make you'd be like Nice dude I am happy for you and it's cool that you see that in yourself If someone tells me they're Asian then yes I will assume they're Asian because they know more about their family history than I do Chloe Bennet says she's Asian so I believe her even though I never would have guessed as much myself You're interpreting scientific definitions at will to fit your agenda whenever it suits you What science are you referring to As I said race isn't about genetics it's a socially defined concept just like gender or anything else we use to define ourselves with I can call myself a gamer Is there some scientific definition for what a gamer is No it's just an idea but it's one of the ways I see myself so it's who I am Identity is every bit as real as any quantifiable property There are other sciences that get into this topic like psychology or sociology But you seem to be focused on sciences that are irrelevant to this topic for some reason
This really sucks because EVGA has always been my favorite GPU AIB
Damn this is pretty sad news Losing competition is bad for the customers in the long run
Woah holy shit what the fuck I only buy EVGA too Damn
EVGA has also been purging other inventory dropped prices drastically for their current gaming accessories Big chances ahead for them I wish them good luck
Well this fucking sucks My last two cards have both been EVGA and I've been pretty happy with them Guess I'm going to have to look elsewhere if I want to get a 40 series Really weird that they're so adamant about not going over to AMD or Intel I get that they're tired of dealing with Nvidia's fuckery but completely dropping a product line that's responsible for 80 of your company's 'm very worried for EVGA's longevity if they don't seek out another GPU partnership
Whoa had no idea Steven spoke pretty good mandarin
This image taken from the Ars article really explains it
Long time coming There's a bit of history here Pre 10 series Founders Edition has always been offered in a limited fashion It was always called NVTTM NV Time to market which means the FE or known as reference model was there in a limited fashion to help AIB to get to market and then the FE disappears and AIB cards took over entirely 10 series was the FIRST time where FE has been offered for the entire LIFE of the product and FE is priced higher vs MSRP for some of the SKU 20 series improved the cooling but again FE charging higher price vs MSRP for some of the SKUs and being offered for the entire LIFE of the product and 30 series basically improved the cooling enough that most people don't need AIB AND it's priced at MSRP AND exists for the life of the product So it's no wonder that AIB started to feel the squeeze now
Asus gave me the run around MSI refused to even look at the card until I threatened legal action gigabyte took a month to reply but EVGA had my GPU RMA taken care of in 2 weeks time Gonna miss 'em
I've been using EVGA GPUs since 2006 FUUUUUUUUCK
Cool so no step up to 4000 series then
Wait what Theres no fucking way this has got to be trolling EVGA is a huge player in the GPU space they were basically the last company that cared and actually tried to get GPUs into gamers hands Losing EVGA is huge in my opinion They had step up the EVGA Queue system pre orders all of it made sense and worked pretty well how can we lose this Certainly Nvidia sales were a huge part of their business very sad news no 4090 FTW3 or K
I'm pretty shocked by this since EVGA was the AIB I preferred for most of my cards I'm still watching the video so I'll hesitate on any opinions until then
Nvidia continuing to be the worst partner From Apple late 2000s early 2010s to EVGA it seems like many companies don't want anything to do with them
reminds me somehow of something linus torvalds said
Damn I've been buying EVGA cards exclusively for almost a decade now because their customer service is second to none Really saddened by this but I totally get their reasoning Nvidia seems to have been trying to eliminate the AIB middlemen for a while now I'm a bit disturbed by their lack of an exit plan though One would think they would have had a partnership with AMD or Intel at least in the works for a big shakeup like this I'll probably switch to AMD if they do eventually decide to go that route
Well that s fucking great That s it man we are fucked It s game over man Game over
20 years of buying EVGA cards Since they were styled as eVGA EVGA team if you're reading this You've supported us your customers all these years We support you too
Oof I personally have always grabbed EVGA Cards Never had issues with them What the hell is going on
JayzTwoCents has a video on it as well Sounds like it basically comes down to nVidia shitting on the AIB partners and EVGA deciding that they keep doing it Between nVidia not disclosing important information like MSRP to AIB partners before announcing them to the public along with nVidia directly competing with AIB partners with Founder's Edition cards that undercut the prices of partners by hundreds of dollars it just wasn't sustainable
RIP one of the best AIB nvidia cards companies I guess Asus is undisputed 1 nvidia AIB maker
So regardless of what's presented in this video I think whats going on here is mainly the ETH merge If you have any idea what's going on in crypto right now the ETH merge has cut out somewhere near 95 of emission for all GPU mineable coins This means as revenue drops to extraordinarily low levels that haven't been seen in years even '18 wasn't this bad there is going to be an absolute deluge of cards onto secondary markets eBay will absolutely get flooded once crypto miners come to terms with what's happening and they absolutely missed the boat for resale While they're still about 500 for 3080s I highly suspect they'll end up around 200 for 3080s I know it sounds insane because it is While a gamer only needs one card crypto miners use dozens or hundreds of cards There is simply not nearly enough demand to suck them up Couple that with the coming 4000 series from Nvidia and 7000 series from AMD that will further drive down demand for old 3k series and 6k series GPUs The smart thing here is to weather the storm and either mothball or suspend operations for a generation or two That means it'll probably be closer to the 5k series launch before they can even look at this again That has a lot to do with what's going to happen to available GPUs and prices it simply wont be worth it as opposed to ramping down Not many manufacturers as well as tech tubers are on top of what's happening with crypto So if you know something your competitors don't you hold your cards to your chest and hope it damages them more it does you This also explains why they haven't taken on Intel or AMD which would've been a bigger FU to Nvidia then simply ceasing all GPU production While they notified Nvidia earlier in the year then the ETH merge was publicly announced if they're a giant manufacturer my guess is they have close links to the crypto community if they were formally dealing with them and notified well in advance This just presented a opportune situation to exit the market and offer a cover story BTW I think EVGA has the best made cards on the market I figured this out years ago while doing crypto mining and figuring out what fails most often and least EVGA has the best fans as well as most robust cards While other manufacturers have robust cards their cooling solutions lack especially long term
So do we just call them e now
EVGA is just getting out of the GPU business So EVGA really must believe the company can survive with this x200B So the obvious question Is it worth buying a EVGA card now
RIP EVGA
WATCH THE DAMN VIDEO MOST OF YOUR DAMN QUESTIONS WOULD BE ANSWERED Jesus
Huge loss for the PC world frankly Not sure if anyone could ever replace the customer service of EVGA
evga always had the best prices out of the top tier brands didn't they
EVGA literally lost hundreds of dollars per card in the 3000 series got treated like shit and with the decline in GPU demand this may be an incredibly smart move 80 of their business was GPUs but their other 20 subsidized the GPU portion Nvidia man Get your shit together
This news damages NVIDIA s brand in my eyes I don t care what people say about companies I do feel brand loyalty to EVGA for the way they treat their customers I ve been buying their products for more than 10 years and all of my computers have their PSUs and both my NVIDIA cards are from EVGA
If true it's just sad that one of Nvidia's few quality partners is leaving I don't see how EVGA can sustain it business in the current form without selling GPU's Will probably be a year or two to see if their transition is viable but once the 30xx series sales drop off I hope they've found alternative revenue
R I P EVGA
I remember reserving a 3060 with EVGA ages ago during the shortage missing the email notification that I could buy my reserved card by 1 day past the deadline to buy it and EVGA support still letting me get my card That made me a customer for life I'm really sad to see them go
Damn nvidia how bad do you have to be to loose one of your closest partners That's been with you for years Holy
NVIDIA has been slowly making the transition to control its entire supply chain With 80 plus of the discrete market under their control they probably don t see the need for more than one AIB partner eg Asus who would be tasked with making custom high end designs while NVIDIA does the rest It would simplify the market give more money and control to NVIDIA and still offer consumers customized cards I think this is where NVIDIA is headed and it wouldnt surprise me if AMD follows
I absolutely believe them when they say Nvidia are impossible to work with as almost everyone working with them has stated that when asked With all the information we have heard from news sites since the mining boom stopped i gathered that AIBs have always agreed to sell what ever Nvidia sends their way so now Nvidia is force feeding AIBs the chips they can no longer sell because of lack of demand and thus forcing as much of any possible loss in revenue on the AIBs instead of Nvidia them self What gets me is why isn't there an agreement on how many cards Nvidia and AIBs can individually sell buy from Nvidia to minimize these situations I know other companies industries do this when working together to avoid it Seems to have been Full steam ahead Damn the icebergs from all the companies specially in the mining boom x200B With that said i'm sorry EVGA are stopping their production of graphics cards They always were some of the best made cards and with great customer care
Would love to see evga going team red
They Posted it to their forums to confirm
I took out a 10 year warranty on my 3080Ti so I'm wondering how that is going to work with this announcement To EVGA if you decide to make AMD cards you will have many loyal customers myself included that will buy them I don't trust Gigabyte ASUS or MSI with graphics cards I just don't
Damn I've been an EVGA only guy for a long time
This brings back memories of XFX ending its partnership with Nvidia way back A real shame
I had EVGA 1080 FTW2 Best card I ever owned I wanted to get EVGA Much love I think I will be looking into AMD
Now that was unexpected EVGA has always bee the Nvidia board partner like Sapphire and XFX are for Radeons
Disrespectful Treatment Laugh in 10 GPUs sent to Europe since RTX3000 launch while also serving the whole queue on NA
Found this response and it kinda makes sense x200B Here is a guess The has to do with GPU prices since they are crashing EVGA paid higher base prices to Nvidia during the shortage As GPU prices continue to drop EVGA card stock is worth less than when they originally paid to fill the warehouses during the shortage Nvidia will not give EVGA a break on the cards they do have in stock Without the adjustment from Nvidia EVGA will lose their ass on current stock Ngreddia said tough luck thats the price of doing business EVGA now pissed off brings us here
Pelosi knew to sell her Nvidia stock lmao
Guess I'm going strix now Rip
That means there will be no EVGA RTX 4XXXs such a shame since EVGA is up there with Asus and MSI
So what does this mean for existing warranties RMAs once they're out of Ampere
Fuck Nvidia
Is this an out of season April fool's joke
from a north American perspective This is insane from a customer standpoint because who do you go to now MSI is okay ASUS makes good cards but they're stupid expensive in direct comparisons and Gigabyte's cards make me feel queazy with how hit and miss they are Aside from those you have the weird European brands like Palit and Galax that are rarely seen here Without EVGA Nvidia just lost their go to AIB for 40 series I guess I'll just have to live with ponying up extra for that ASUS quality and hope I don't have to RMA it edit PNY is apparently American
So if you have extended warranty on a 3080Ti until 2026 what happens if it dies in 2025
RIP all the people hoping to step up to 4000
EVGA has been my go to for nearly every card purchased in the last 10 years FE this year during shortage Sucks to see it come to this loved their build quality and customer support Interested to see what they have planned I guess for future cards I ll be going with ASUS
Fuck I love EVGA cards This kinda sucks
Do the math nvidia making 65 margins AIBs 5 only makes sense i for one applaud evga for takimg a stance and AND evga was imho the best AIB for Nvidia amd this hurts but nothing but love for Evga
Ok This is interesting I m someone who despises EVGA but I m not actually happy about this I got two power supplies from them one legitimately exploded a month after purchase the other stopped working after 3 months But I ve always respected their GPUs I never bought one of them almost only used mid quality second hands but I ve only heard good things about their GPUs I just don t know how to feel about this
I've been buying EVGA cards for 20 years Nvidia must be a real piece of work for them to throw in the towel like this Hell my 1660 Super has literal fire damage on it from a bad peripheral lighting itself up and it still runs like a champ charred faceplate and fans and all This sorta sucks
Guess I m switching to amd
I guess I'm going back to AMD Sapphire for my next upgrade
They're cutting 80 of their revenue because working with Nvidia is too difficult Whoa
Damn they re the only manufacturer I know of with tolerable customer service too
This really sucks I guess I ll go with MSI from here on out as I ve had bad luck with ASUS and Gigabyte
Zotac is loving this bit of news I bet
Ok My next GPU will me AMD
Intel I am rooting for you to bust in and shake this near monopoly up Kick Nvidia's ass please Or AMD
I have a hard time believing they won t be transitioning to AMD cards
You have to be a pretty god awful scummy business partner to work with for a company to make the decision to burn the source of 80 of their revenue Let that sink in
God dammit I hate this I felt so good about hunting down an EVGA 4000 series to replace my EVGA 3080 I guess I keep my 3080 and shadow box it The thought of anything else in my PC makes me uncomfortable
Damn Nvidia I think you really f'd up this time EVGA has been my goto since forever Great product great support great warranty trade up programs etc You should probably try to make this right and see if they'll have you back
I've been exclusively buying eVGA cards since BFG stopped selling cards I don't need a 3000 series card since my 1080 is perfectly fine for me This news has me strongly considering buying a 3080ti 3090 just so that I have an eVGA card for the foreseeable future even though 4000 series is right around the corner I guess I'll see what the specs and pricing of the 4000 series is before making a decision We love you eVGA your cards will be sorely missed
Nvidia has been a shitty company for years when it comes to partners it's surprising that someone that clearly cares for his company even managed to deal with this for so many years Kudos to EVGA despite losing a lot of revenue this is probably a right choice if they want to keep their heart in it
This will hurt EVGA more than NVidia
Nvidia calls AIB leeches uses TSMC to make the
This is just the tip of the iceberg I feel like big changes are coming and EVGA is just the first to make a move
Without EVGA I'm going to AMD
Noo EVGA is one of my favorite card makers Always had the best designs
They finally got so customer unfriendly that even corporations are hit
They're the only company as far as I know that tried to get the 30 series in the hands of enthusiasts and fight scalpers miners using bots it might have taken 6 months to get my card but I didn't have to fight a losing battle every restocking what a shame plus their CEO and costumer service was top notch
Add it to the list of partnerships Nvida has trashed XFX BFG tech Sony Microsoft etc It was rumored they were withholding 4XX Fermi from BFG tech at the time
Fuck nvdia going amd next gen 100
Honestly one of the biggest reasons I've stuck with team green over the years is EVGA themselves Very good cards with solid customer support they haven't let me down once I love my 3090 KP Not having them as an aib combined with the rumored insane power usage of the 40 series and yet more confirmation that Nvidia is a scum company has basically confirmed that I'm gonna be sitting this next round out maybe even giving team red a try once I need more performance headroom Nvidia really needs to stop this vertical control bullshit it's hurting their partners
I never had an EVGA card but i always heard only good things about them it's a sad day
I like EVGA cards
This is a shocking news always bought EVGA cards
You know this got me thinking Maybe EVGA had a sneakpeak on pricing for the RTX40 series and said Well fuck this as the issue got much worse then the RTX20 or RTX30 series due to the mining crash and how we know Nvidia is going to want to keep profits up even if artificially inflated just a thought
My last 5 cards have been EVGA ones rip
come to AMD please
Good finally after a decade of disgusting anticonsumer and sabotaging tactics some one is fed up and brakes the ties Nvidia is absolutely appalling and must be held accountable
Damn that s a bummer I liked my EVGA card
Wtf nvidia what are you doing to your partner literally your top quality partner
EVGA usually has the better prices their support was great and the quality of the product was great Them dropping out is gonna hurt I really don't know who to go to now Gigabyte support is trash ASUS has a bad rep with support I've used MSi in the past and had no issues with them so depending on the reviews I might go with them I have no experience with Zotac Palit
The only ones making money on Nvidia right now is Nvidia Everyone else are trying to sell as much as possible while limiting their losses Rumors has been saying that the allocation on 4000 chips would be based on how many cards were sold since March when the whole market collapsed Only the big ones can stay in that game Evga was just too small but I really think they made the right decision Another possibility will be Intel now that they don t have to protect their Nvidia contract
One thing I noticed is EVGA s all 30 series card are make in Taiwan thus it helped them during 2018 2021 trade war with China Cause any card make in China will be impose higher penalties import tax However after the tax penalty expired on Apr 2022 all other AIB will flood the market with vastly cheaper MIC cards which EVGA can t compete from cost standpoint It might be too late for them to find a Chinese manufacturer and resource the chip due to covid lock down and other issues But EVGA do put himself in a position that cost more and sell at a same price with AIBs MIC card
No one I know in the industry likes working with nvidia
Just a huge bummer EVGA was one of the best GPU companies They truly were there for their customers and helped me with RMAs multiple times perfectly They do have good power supplies so I'll still get those but that leaves MSI Asus as the only respectable GPUs left There must have been some issues with what the companies have been paying for GPUs and how much the prices dropped and now they are taking a loss
This is such a shame EVGA was the Boar s Head of GPU deli meats
What surprised me in this video is how I thought higher end cards were supposed to be the most overpriced and therefore the most profitable per ''creativity'' while the cards are sold almost twice the price of MSRP Anybody has an explanation Is it NVIDIA selling their high end chips way more expensive than lower end or is it something else
Evga was like non existent here or if it was present it was overpriced but this still feels shocking
Whoever Picks Up Vince and Tin is probably going to get my business
EVGA is the ONLY Mfg I purchased nVidia from and the only one PERIOD since an old MSI 7870 Their service was second to none and the whole industry will suffer as there is no more bar to reach
Well it looks like my shower thoughts of waiting for a good deal on an EVGA 3080 12GB instead of waiting out an EVGA 4070 launch just got upgraded to Plan A
I will be there to support eVGA and if they go team red I ll be there too eVGA did a lot for GeForce overall between the software engineering and brand support that nVidia piggybacked off of this is more of a loss for nVidia and us than anyone else This will be where the industry shifts because of eVGA being a positive actor it leaves team green damaged severely
Damn that really friggin blows I ve been exclusive to EVGA s nVidia based cards for over 15 years now I held out for a year to get a 30 series card from EVGA because I ve never found a combo that performs better in my builds Looks like MSI or Gigabyte are going to get my dollars now In the back of my mind I feel like this will get resolved because the entire industry is going to feel this I do wonder who is really to blame nVidia or EVGA We will likely never know but they need to get their shit together In the end they are going to punish the consumer over some corporate BS
This is not good for Nvidia cards This was my go to brand
Damn I literally just had my ass saved with an EVGA warranty My 3080 died out of nowhere I got a cross shipped replacement less than a week later This had me ready to go with EVGA again next time and I was really digging the AIO water cooled card as well FTW3 hybrid That's a bummer
Nvidia has been shitting on their partners for years Others should follow suit If you got no one to make your cards you lose your leverage Force them to renegotiate their partnerships with the partners being the one's with the leverage
I can t watch the video but is EVGA just focusing on other parts and accessories now Seems odd for them to give up such a huge sector Makes me think they are ready to partner with another chip maker or something
I have owned 18 Nvidia based cards starting with the Riva TNT by Creative 15 out the 18 have been EVGA cards as their customer service and support have been fantastic I had a bad pair of GTX 470s in SLI and they crossed shipped them to me with little to no fuss When I watercooled my GTX 680s they basically said go ahead it won't void your warranty Heck the support guy even recommend the waterblocks that he used on his own cards As a consumer this sucks as they are my go to brand for Nvidia based cards
RIP we lost a real one today
Part of me wonders if this is a bargaining and will likely continue to be harsh against Nvidia given how much shit their other board partners get and how loved EVGA was in North America
Feels like what we saw with BFG Tech which was before Evga That company made some slick cards then went away I worry the same fate is coming to eVGA
Wow absolutely shocking news for a while I could not believe my own eyes and ears With Lovelace launching soon this must be especially horrific news for people going for RTX 4000 series cards with how great consumer support EVGA was providing for years which you can't say about some other AIB partners and also reference cards from nvidia themselves
What the fuck
Wonder if this means we'll see AMD based EVGA cards Now that would be something special
I m just because kingpin had software voltage control And the warranty and how many peoples jobs will be affected by this
Well this sucks EVGA has or had the best VBIOS mods on the planet
I have an EVGA XC3 3090 that I got in Jan 2021 in my main gaming rig It's the most money I've ever spent on a card but am ultimately happy with my purchase I was on the fence about 40 series but with EVGA gone I really don't see myself bothering with the RTX 4090
This is huge EVGA isn't just Nvidia's best AIB they were the best GPU AIB period They had the best customer service best warranty and the ability to step up along with products that were consistently top tier This comes as a massive loss for the consumer I also wonder what this means for warranties on existing products Will they reserve enough inventory to see them all through I wish them all the best and I don't blame them for being done with Nvidia's shenanigans but
Holy hell I've only bought EVGA cards for the last 20 years I can barely wrap my head around this My nVidia loyalty has really been largely about my affinity of EVGA Excellent service upgrade plans driver support etc I don't think this breakup will be good for either company
My experience with Zotac has been pretty good Perhaps I shall fully switch to them
Holy
So this CEO is dropping their company out of video cards and supposedly not goijng to restructure I think eVGA needs a new CEO
Sucks for nVidia I have more loyalty to EVGA than I do to nVidia my next GPU is still going to be EVGA no matter who they get their chips from AMD presumably Maybe Intel has impressed EVGA with some engineering samples from their next generation I'm betting I'm not the only one out there either who is more loyal to EVGA than nVidia
Nvidia want to skip the aib they make more money selling directly to customers Expect more founders edition and more rip customer
I'm an AMD dude so for me EVGA has only ever been good power supplies Today was the first time I even learned they make graphics cards and other stuff too My condolences to you all on the next few years of absolute fuckery that Nvidia is going to pull on you Between this and the plans they layed out in the earnings call I'm staying faaaaaar away
This reminds me of BFG video
nVIDIA has been screwing AIB makers so badly the AIB margins are so atrocious only companies which skimp on design manufacturing or customer service can even afford to make AIBs for nVIDIA anymore You buy nVIDIA you get good design good build or good service pick ONE 't even pick two
Feeling good for having an amd card
So I guess the only American company left making Nvidia cards besides Nvidia themselves is PNY Are their products any good
That is sad news I love my EVGA 3080ti
the start of something new for all aib partners
Sucks for competition but I was never a fan of the look of EVGA cards and only bought Asus and MSI before they became a shady company Bad day for everyone because at the end of the day the consumer loses but nothing we can do
And Nvidias stock rose 2 're gonna care
I hope amd offers em a deal and they go back to business
The most upvoted post in a looooong time That really says something
will EVGA go to intel or AMD
this is not good
My 2080 Ti might be the last custom watercooled card as I know that EVGA customer support has my back Even if I take the cooler off Menawhile good luck disassembling those damn FE cards if you can get one at I live in EU those do not exist here Well I will skip another gen see how things turn out and if nothing changes go for a Zotac Or AMD if its better for my money EVGA is literally the only PC hardware company I fanboyed Pushed those cards to 95 builds I did and I did couple of em past 10 decades couple dozens for different people D
I wanted to go EVGA but there queue system really fucked europeans over So went with asus which i am very happy with
Been a loyal supporter since their 8800GT I wonder if Kingpin will go to A
Wow Nvidia must be taking lessons from Oracle or vice versa
So how much would they have to charge per skew for them to make a profit What would the market look like if Nvidia didnt control it Is nvidia really the voice of reasoning here Shit just dont make sense lol but welcome to clown world
Damn I ve been buying evga cards for 15 years so this kind of sucks
Fantastic video and reporting form Gamers Nexus as always This will be a loss for consumers EVGA was one of the better AIB manufacturers Nvidia sounds like they slowly want to shift to cutting the AIBs out of the equation It also sounds like EVGA made some missteps that cost them with the market chaos cryptocurrency created
Correct me if I am wrong but was EVGA not the only Nvidia AIB partner that supported did not invalidate warranties if a card was water cooled
As someone who has gone EVGA since the GTX 670 this stings me a lot I purchased a 3080 Ti from EVGA last year If nothing improves when I get around to another upgrade maybe 7 years down the line don't be surprised if I end up going AMD
Danm I've always bought evga cards because I don't trust the other aibs
Evga was always the best board partner no contest Could corsair jump in the ring now Hmm
So basically they are throwing away business over a child tantrum I can't see this turning out good for them turning their back on the largest GPU developer
First BFG now EVGA Sapphire is the last A AiB and they're exclusively AMD
Wow this is a huge bombshell Utterly shocking But here's the biggest thing Say you give the middle finger to Nvidia Why not partner with AMD or Intel I think this is a short term thing they don't want to be seen as that girl who breaks up with a guy and already moves on to someone else right after unless the price was right Because there is no fricking way they lose 80 of their revenue but keep the same number of people on unless they expect a big windfall What are they going to sell Keyboards Power supplies Capture cards They say the profit margin may be higher on power supplies but how many of those sales are people bundling a graphics card with a psu They're fucked unless they drive into a totally different road and or partner up with AMD Intel EVGA's CEO steered the ship into dire straits It's really rich of them to talk about losses when they made record profits during the pandemic Everyone knew that the mining operations were ending soon they made the business decision to overstock He should just retire if he's going to use personal reasons as an excuse Btw Steve's mandarin has gotten quite good at least based on those lines
Real good chance this makes me rethink if I go green or red next gen I've been going with EVGA since the 400 series because their CS is second to none compared to the other garbage board partners I've had nothing but seamless support from EVGA You done fucked up A aron Nvidia
I have only ever made one PC using a 2080Ti from them Can t complain I had to repaste it though I was going to get a 40 series s from them Now who Who s the next best
Seems like Nvidia finally fucked themselves Good for evga
This is crazy
Son of a bitch I have been buying evga gpus for over 12 years now They have the best customer service hands down and I have used their step up program 3 times Such an amazing company to work with I am really pissed I have to buy elsewhere now
NVIDIA is a nightmare to deal with behind the scenes I can t blame EVGA at all here They want to make a quality product and be allowed to turn at least a marginal profit NVIDIAs monopoly on a variety of things in this respect is dangerous to the future of GPU tech You ll tell me NVIDIA isn t an absolute monopoly but in a number of industries there s basically no choice without serious risks It s not good for gamers or science
EVGA doesn't want to work with AMD Intel because they don't want to make NVIDIA feel if NVIDIA even want to entertain being the one approaching EVGA about any deals
Nvidia has been screwing their AIB partners for several generations now Truth be told Nvidia relies quite a bit on them to bear the burden of offloading GPUs which when you factor in distribution marketing etc its quite the penny As unrealistic as it sounds if every other major AIB in the US did the same thing right now You'd bet Nvidia's revenue would easily drop 20 30 as the supply chain and routes of distribution is not something you can just suddenly find overnight or even months
Wasn't a fan of EVGA 3000 series but we need more not less board partners It's sad news really
H don't rip the wiring out just for quick money EVGA is your best partner and if they are done with your shit bud you got a problem Especially since you still have all that extra TSMC allocation after the mining crash You should be working with partners more to shift that over allocation down the chain DON'T pull and Intel and throw away your market advantage because of poor business decisions
Any chance we can get prorated refunds on extended EVGA warranties
Guess I'm not buying a 40 series
I honestly have not like the design of their cards for a long time Very tacky And they had that recent issue where their GPUs were dying as they were using lower end parts in the MMO game people were playing However they had a good warranty and one less seller is not good for the consumer The timing is a little susss considering the GPU mining death and nVidia's soon to be announced products I know a lot of people will just think this is all nVidia's fault but we are only hearing EVGA's side Making such a huge announcement and relying on popular YouTubers to spread the news is very strange And EVGA's only official written comment on this coming as a short forum post on their message board seems suboptimal for a business of literally any size
Guess I ll go AMD next RTX didn t live up to the hype for me anyway
Ironic that everyone in here is talking about returned cards Yeah that's cause they were evga the internets gpu company
Make your voice heard NVIDIA has been abusing their partners for years From undercutting their margins to be unsustainable to undercutting their prices for first party GPU s to other shitty practices Speak with your wallet go to AMD for one generation or skip 4K series because these corporate shills will not change policies unless it affects that tier bottom line Us losing such a dependable manufacturer is solely Nvidia s fault
S nothing else Edit so it appears that nvda is competing against the aibs with their founders line and the latest drops in price are making that cards non profitable Maybe all AIBS show break
Wow this is a shocker
They must be sitting on a mountain of 3000 series chips
I ve heard EVGA was pretty balanced in their gpu s design
WTF Are the going out of business or just switching to AMD Intel cards At work can t watch Shit this makes my next video card purchase a lot harder I ve only bought EVGA since the 900 series and I love their hybrid cards too This could be the end of hybrid cards too I know a couple others make them but EVGA started them and had the most selection of them too
I had to double check the date Nope it is not April 1st
Oh man my last 3 4 NVIDIA cards were from EVGA So WTF
Maybe try out AMD now
EVGA come to team RED Bring that high quality to a company that will never turn on you
I was expecting them to maybe go to AMD like XFX did but man I guess not hope they don t end up like BFG
Effects of a shocked GPU market increased price to meet a temporarily increased demand Now that the demand is lower nvidia is over leveraged on their long term production plan and must make some short sighted decisions
Dang Moved to AMD this current gen Have the utmost respect for EVGA as a company and the community they have established They have always been my preferred AIB due to their excellent customer service going back ten years ago with the GTX 680 The reason why I moved to AMD Radeon GPUs is because I could no longer support Nvidia as a company This just proves why my decision made sense EVGA was probably the closest AIB Nvidia had and for them to absolve their graphics card division and terminating their relationship with Nvidia is telling I really hope AMD reaches out to EVGA Would be ecstatic to support them that way Also it was kind of a foreshadow when EVGA made and AMD motherboard
In hindsight the clown lip rtx 30 design may have almost made sense
So how good is FSR 2 0 compared to DLSS nowadays
To under cut your partners is unheard of and this has never bin dune before not in sound not in video not in graphics by doing so you tell your competitors we are your competition with you and we can berry you because we have an advantage in parts pricing this simple is unheard of and by that large of a margin is insane
I believe EVGA is done unless they change their minds and partner with AMD or intel
Guess I'm an AMD only guy now lol
LMAO
Lol what the fuck EVGA is literally the go to for solid cards Stemming back for AGES This is a complete blindside to me There has to be much more to this to come
Dang EVGA is the only AIB I actually like
Nvidia be burning these bridges
I guess I'm switching to AMD now I was borderline before but now it's settled Can't trust any of the other aib
I don't feel sorry for them because they were also riding on those sweet miner profits during the pandemic yes they had a queue system but let's not let that cloud the elephant in the room
Even though I doubt anyone will see this I'm posting Thank you for being awesome EVGA After getting burned with other RMAs and how awesome EVGA customer service was I used EVGA for everything I could for several builds of my own for friends and family and for corporate customers This all but confirms Nvidia is trying to go the Apple route and vertically integrate I don't blame them for that it's a good business decision but the way they're doing it makes me not want to buy anything Nvidia ever again If they don't want AIBs then Nvidia should just say so instead of treating AIBs like trash and undercutting their sales while mandating pricing that favors founders edition cards Good luck EVGA Nvidia thanks for convincing me to go team red for my AM5 build when they're readily available
This is really sad to hear EVGA s always been a go to for me with their customer support It s really unfortunate to see them retreat from this space Hopefully in the future they can get back into it
seems more like suicide by EVGA as if NVDA cares
NVDA just lost a lot of momentum with ETH going to POS less GPU buyers The market will be flooded with last gen GPUs as ETH POW winds down which is a huge headwind for selling next gen cards NVDA has a contract with TSMC that is can't back out from They're on the hook for GPUs that they may not be able to sell I think EVGA is smart holding it cards close to chest and waiting to see where the dust settles EVGA asking NVDA to be reasonable is also not a difficult accommodation
Long live AMD
Watching this now interesting
I wonder if they will still make motherboards
This is a bad thing for all of us even if you're not a fan of EVGA Less competition means higher prices Also EVGA didn't charge as bad of a tariff tax on their GPU for US buyers
Everyone is reacting about the EVGA side But think about it how fucked NVIDIA must be for EVGA to settle on this being necessary
Well I don't run a business but I have to GPU's go back to MSRP Below MSRP and now companies complain about losing profits LOL I know you all love EVGA but they bent us over just like every other company during the shortage Am I suppose to feel bad that these retailers are losing profits with GPU sales now
Interesting Nvidia being a disgusting company to work with is nothing new but not going with AMD and maybe Intel is an intriguing choice Is it a negotiation tactic to get AMD Intel to offer better terms to them or are they really just leaving the segment for good We shall see Was hoping to hear the great news that they would work with anyone but it never came Sadness
Something seems a little off here How were EVGA losing money on cards at current market prices The decision was made back in April when cards were still priced high and still selling out instantly at those high prices So how were they losing money on those I don't doubt Nvidia screwed them over but that part of the story just doesn't make much sense
Whoah
Noooooooooooooooooooooo I too have extended warranty Is this partly why they stopped the rewards
Dang I was about to dump Asus loud ass Strix 3090 Cool whine was terrible and it died on me so I was left with no GPU for a month for next gen and switch to EVGA It s unfortunate since their 3090ti seems very well made I guess I am buying FE or MSI if their offering is good
Asus and msi cards has ugly design
Time to short EVGA stock before official announcement
Fuck me i spent 120 on an extended warranty for my 3080 3 months back hope i got my coverage im a year from now
So what about updates for existing cards
Fuck the step up What the gorram hell happens to my 5 year extended XC3 3080 ti warranty
Well that's it for buying Nvidia cards then
Truly the end of an era Most of my GPUs have been EVGA and I just got an EVGA 3090 in the past few months I suppose I felt some brand loyalty due to the nostalgia I had of picking up my first ever GPU an EVGA GTX 550ti over 10 years ago now
Woah didn t expect that Rip to evga gpus Who s best to buy from now
Bro this sucks EVGA was always a brand I felt I could rely on
I don t trust the other NVIDIA AIBs Might just sit out this next gen or switch to AMD
Looks like that nice warranty I got on my 3090 ti vs the b stock is a
The fact that team green was so shitty it made EVGA ditch GPUs altogether is so disheartening I wasn t an NVIDIA fan I was an EVGA fan Guess after my FTW3 3080 Ti dies I m a free agent hopefully team red and team blue have good options
How did Nvidia become so toxic of a partner that EVGA would rather choose to terminate than stay with them 80 of their revenue was Nvidia
This is my fault guys I'm 're always a step
It's likely they may have a new partnership with Intel or AMD I doubt they'd kill off their GPU business without a plan B
It is really sad to read of all of the customers on this thread saying the other AIBs are trash knowing full well Nvidia is a awful company not even thinking for a second to not encourage such disgusting business no wonder Nvidia pulls crap like this with an army of customers supporting them like that
It was only EVGA or Nvidia on my purchase list I had problems with the other AIB in the past MSI is a close second
This could be a move to close shop before taking losses on rma replacements of mined gpus
Evga should walk back and partner with amd On that does anyone know if amd is better to their partners Edit also I think it'll be amd for me through sapphire or xfx if they are still a thing Anyone have good rma experiences with those two
LOL goodbye Nvidia and stock price dropping on Monday to 2020
Just sucks
That s like 80 of their revenue isn t it Oof
EVGA is really the only option to go in GPU Another i trust is ASUS but the more cost than EVGA with less warranty doesnt make me think it worth Can Nvidia give some reasonable explanations
just watching jays video because its shorter and i need to go but wow my first gpu was a evga gt 730 4gb
Wait so evga is done or are they switching to AMD
i think ill send a quick email to evga and find out how this is going to affect my 10 year warranty on my current 3090
I doubt disrespect is the major cause lol
Well my two cents is they bought too many chips from nvidia during the mining boom now they crying about too much inventory and losing money Seems like they didnt learn from the last mining boom Sad for their employees who wont have a job anymore Sad day for everyone that likes EVGA though
Dudes prolly did 3 years worth of numbers in one year during the shortage and are now cashing out trying to save face
Founders Ed Then
ITT people acting like EVGA is the only brand lol Wtf why lol
Uhhhh this is not good EVGA was one of the larger card providers Now all those customers are going to flood in looking for other vendors cards making it that much harder to obtain any of the other company's cards
I bought 3090 FTW3 Ultra for over 2000 last Feb and it is an overheating mess If they are losing several hundred per GPU now on the high end they were making 500 700 before unless nVidia took more out then My system has EVGA AIOs with terrible fans that I had to replace with Arctic fans and EVGA PSUs I bought their keyboard and had to return it within a minute of trying it out The 1080 Ti FTW was legendary but I feel the 30 series was really weak for EVGA and other AIBs surpassed them Also they couldn't scalp like Zotac Asus and MSI who could raise prices to whatever they wanted to
Stephen you are usually on point but you disappoint this time You are running on the false assumption that the CEO is going to tell you everything about his business I am not sure exactly what is going on but what is obvious is your analysis on the employees is wrong I don t think the CEO is being ignorant about job roles and employee retention Many talks have a non disclosure agreement so if he was talking with AMD or Intel he would have to deny it But I almost wonder if it could be another third party that they might consider working with that is capable of designing GPUs I seriously doubt Apple because they like to slap their name on everything but Samsung seems to be a logical possibility They definitely have the resources and engineering I am just speculating actually pretty wildly I don t know much more than he does but he should know that something is in the works just by what he was and wasn t being told Sure they are stopping manufacturing of GPUs until something is in place This happened relatively fast But if you have ever used one of their high end cards especially Kingpin cards you would know that they hate compromise
Always bought Asus for high their cards but mid and low was EVGA for me Made reliable products for all stacks just liked ASUS high 70 TI cooling Just preference
Okay so this is something that nobody saw 's
Fuck it my rx470 runs the games I play fine
I can't buy evga in my country anyway
the video drags on and stretches what little info they have out but its a
XFX smiles
XFX took 2 years to refund me for a defective card stay away
Maybe they see the writing on the wall with the crypto crash and ETH going PoW 4000 series cards are going to collect dust at the prices Nvidia will demand
EVGA Ultra Navi 7900 XT come with it slightly smiling facegrinning face with smiling eyesbeaming face with smiling eyes And are we also witnessing history here the fall of the Nvidia GPU empire entirely I greatly respect EVGA and they are my number one pick They have my support wherever they go Sad panda pandacrying face EDIT EVGA is leaving the GPU industry entirely Seriously what happened behind close doors to make us lose such a great company that they won't even go AMD
im about to boycott nvidia at this point what the fuck
Nvidia you just lost me as a customer and EVGA should fire their CEO
I'm guessing evga is having problems selling off 30 series cards and wanted more discounts nvidia after crypto dying lost nearly half of its customers and doesn't want to mark down chips as much to evga Both companies probably trying to call each others bluffs and here we are Oh well
Wow this comes out of nowhere
Sounds like Nvidia is in a bind and probably wants their AIBs to take extra inventory to get shit off their books eVGA probably doesn t want to be part of scheme especially after VMware getting called out and fined
What the FUCK
Too bad NVidia is in a too comfortable place they can treat everyone as shit even consumers Amd need to get it's shit together
Apple gonna swoop in here
So what happens when I have to RMA my 5 year old 3080ti that I have a 10 year warranty on
There are SEVEN COMMERCIAL BREAKS FOR THIS VIDEO
Glad I'm in Canada where MSI is actually 've heard of them in the states are brutal
Probably the worst hardware related news ever
I had a rumor going around about xiaomi's black shark division going into the GPU and PC hardware market as well don't know if it's true but if it is I'm excited although I know most of you will not even touch those things because of CCP spyware lol
When I was looking for a used gpu EVGA was the only brand I considered
EVGA was my first discrete GPU the 1060 3GB Their quality and customer service has been top notch I am angry and sad that this has happened Way to fuck up Nvidia I do hope EVGA makes a masterful return one day
That leather jacket guy seems like a jackass with his illegitimate children galactic ego overpriced garbage video game graphics and he has to look tough and savvy so all the Georgian mobsters will buy his crap for their Bitcoin mining operations to finance their criminal enterprise Yeah EVGA made a wise choice cutting ties with that gang of miscreants
Good riddance
Click bait ish title TL DR EVGA is getting out of the GPU business altogether They only sold nvidia cards and cited nvidia's treatment was the reason but they're not going to start selling AMD or Intel GPUs It's not financial it's about respect is what they told Steve They then told Steve that they're basically pissed about nvidia selling the Founder's Edition at a lower price EVGA can't compete with the pricing without cutting corners so they're just bailing on the entire market segment That sounds VERY financial and I'm confused by this Speculation If I had to guess I think that EVGA feels like GPU demand is going to fall off of a cliff and never go back up enough to justify buying into the order minimums nVidia imposes on partners EVGA seems kinda salty about nvidia not letting them mark up their GPUs more to increase profits during the past 2 years of insane demand nVidia is probably imposing higher order numbers from their partners to balance out their own large order for TSMC Fab capacity and EVGA doesn't want to overpay for inventory that they might have to sit on and sell at cost or at a loss The whole thing sounds VERY financial to me and I don't think EVGA will survive this unless this is temporary and they'll re enter the GPU space once demand and supply have balanced out Sad There are residual effects from GPU sales on sales of other products Someone who bought an EVGA GPU may have also decided to buy a PSU and or MB simply because they wanted to match parts or stick to one brand for their build The mindshare and attention generated by GPU products is huge
Can someone explain what this means in terms of a car manufacturer Is Nvidia just selling direct to consumers now vs using a dealership Also does EVGA take a prebuilt car and modify it or is this a case where they take the paper design build it themselves with their own modifications
They probably have too many RTX 3000 GPUs in their warehouses that they understand they won't be able to sell Sadly I expect them to an announce bankruptcy in a few weeks
i delete my og post due to a death threat message fk you who ever it is using a fake account
Look i know its sad EVGA is dropped now but im gonna be real I have had many MANY gpus from being a miner take my advice here dont blame me for being a and EVGA GPUs have been really solid BUT i have had EVGA be the only GPUs that have had artifcating or completely died out EVGA also was the reason for the 1080 ftw getting on fire and also the new world explosing GPUs Its a shame EVGA quit but out of all my products MSI ASUS GIGABYTE they have been the only ones i have heard of common hardware problems I know that their support is good but i really think it has to because they probably use cheaper parts have more hardware issues It was super easy to deal with customer support but i think other manufacturers do develop better GPUs that the risk of needing support is super slim People that are completely going team red well let me tell you AMD had the most garbage drivers and if you go sapphire oh boy the quality super cheap But ill admit i didnt purchase high end sapphire cards Hopefully NVIDIA isn't acctually being a garbage company though that is definitly the main story here Jacob did a fantastic job on twitter during the 30 series crisis hopefully they can make something work
Thats bad new for their rma cases
Is EVGA going to come up with their OWN line of GPUs
I m going MSI Their 1060 twin frozr gpu i got years ago is still running strong Looking at that 3090 ti
Sapphire is our only hope
I Nvidia not EVGA Every thread about this has had people whining about Oh no how will I get my video cards I only buy EVGA Maybe rethink your purchasing choices
So will they terminated nvidia driver updates as well Or just the continuation of nvidia graphic cards
Tech Jesus now needs to strap on a GoPro and mountain bike around in circles on mountain to gather his thoughts on this news
Puts on EVGA
So lame They burn their gpu division because of what Better be a coherent financial decision not some temper tantrum
Noooo
Their cards were shit on the 30 series so thank god Didn t plan to buy them anyways Horrible experience with my evga 3090
Bye bye EVGA wastebasket
Meh I know reddit loves evga but their cards are always stupidly overpriced for basically nothing Like 20 extra price for something like 10 less temp and 1 more performance if that
Gigabyte is the best anyway
I'll just find another AIB then Or encourage Nvidia to make more of their own cards and sell them as such As of August 2022 the Steam Hardware Survey reports Nvidia has a 76 to 15 lead over AMD more than 5x So long as Nvidia has better performance features and or drivers people will keep buying them The people going 'Scumbag Nvidia Nvidia bad ' and threatening to switch to AMD to send a message unless you actually think you're getting a better deal with AMD you're only hurting yourself Just like the HWUB outrage at the end of the day we're all looking for the best performance per price Right now and for the past several years that's been Nvidia
Well um it's not that 4090 is gonna be faster than 7900XT 's hope EVGA make AMD this time
So we're taking junkie Jesus word on this with no other sources
EVGA The company that put a notice on their forum threatening people to not buy stolen GPUs They accused someone else of being disrespectful
Didnt EVGA get exposed for cutting corners with their GPU boards which led to runaway framerates causing the GPU to fail No surprise that Nvidia gave them the cold shoulder Good riddance
Too bad I really like EVGA But if EVGA thinks I'm going to start buying AMD cards they're smoking drugs In my over 30 years of PC gaming and building custom gaming rigs I have seen many many EVGA's come and go There will be more Sorry to see you go EVGA But it's not going to have the impact people think it will
Dam The end of an era for sure
damn i've only ever bought evga cards
Anyone know if Microcenter will honor there extended warranties Im pretty sure the rep said just bring it into them and they'll take care of it all Im not to sure
Huge bummer I was going to stick with EVGA there customer service was top notch and card power supply quality was great also keeping multiple pieces of hardware to a single company was awesome Hope I can find a new PSU GPU same company
Realistically how long can EVGA fulfill warranties at this point I just bought a 3070 from them and trust that it's high quality and won't break but could I realistically fulfill my warranty 2 years from now and get a card
Will they also rebrand to EnoVGA
This is not good That's their main revenue market Even if they are not making a lot of money they have a market presence When they stop being relevant to the public you are dead Unless they eventually go to AMD even though they say they aren't right now or come out with some great products in other markets I have a feeling that it is the beginning of the end for them People don't buy mouse and keyboards because of the evga name They buy GPU
Damn I really don't like the other options for nvidia personally This is going to shake up my purchasing decisions a lot
Looks like I'm likely going to skip on the 4000 series and just hold onto my EVGA 3080 I wasn't in a huge hurry to get a new card and they were my best brand Not sure if this decision will be permanent based on what I gathered from Jay and the CEO but devastating for the immediate future of GPUs
I have to imagine that they did some projections based on how many new 30 Series cards are still in the manufacturer and vendor pipelines and how many thousands of used GPUs are likely to come onto the market soon from shuttered Ethereum mining operations Most importantly I'm guessing that Nvidia makes their manufacturing partners buy a certain minimum amount of chips every generation They probably decided that they would rather shrink their business down to a few existing profitable products then try to gut it out by selling high quality but expensive 40 series GPUs There's so much competition now from used cards and their own 30 series cards wherw they are already projecting to lose hundreds of dollars on each flagship card and there's still every other manufacturer or there probably making the lowest priced 40 series cards that they can to compare I wouldn't be surprised if despite having to downsize their business they come through it okay but some other major card manufacturer faces serious financial woes or bankruptcy soon based on the same circumstances
That is super sad EVGA was the best AIB Do we have any American AIBs left
I sadly called this when they ended by EVGA Bucks program
Oof that is a big loss evga is very trustworthy with warranty even tho they messed up at times
Man Nvidia doesn t seem like a company that would slash prices for 4000 series cards
Yikes on bikes I've been buying EVGA cards for as long as I can remember
Oh wow the price cap that must have been infuriating during the mining boom
Damn bruh I just bought an EVGA 3090Ti and it was my favorite looking gpu out of all of the other brands
Fuck my card is EVGA This is big to EVGA buyers
So theoretically if I wanted to return my 3090 ti ftw3 what is that specific card's direct competition
Sonofa I was looking forward to an EVGA 4060 to barely fit in my SFF case since they are one of the few that make a true 2 slot card instead of 2 5
Waiting for all the folks who said Hardware Unboxed deserved to be blacklisted to come a long and say EVGA deserved the way they were treated too
I had Palit 460 s in SLI everything after has been EVGA hmmmm a conundrum
EVGA was always great but I dig Aorus Gigabyte stuff these days I only upgrade once every 4 or 5 years so it doesn't bug me hell EVGA could be back in a couple years anyway
back when my gtx460 died they replaced with gtx560 I will continue to support them
Guess I'm team Red Blue now Lol
I've been buying EVGA exclusively since 2010 this sucks 460 560 ti another 560 ti 770 1080 and my current 3080
very sad
Who s got the TLDR
The biggest problem with this is a lot of people bought EVGA for their better warranty they were pretty much the best AIB in the space for warranties Yes they had a few issues with cards notably the GTX 1080 FTW cards that I bought But I can excuse all of that because I pretty much knew that EVGA always had my back unless it was my fault like pouring water all over your card while it's running Losing them is a huge blow to this space The Step Up Program was a huge upgrade path for many people they could count on EVGA to make the enthusiast not feel like they were going to miss out today that if you bought some mining card that was EVGA the warranty transferred to the second hand customer it was a huge relief as a second hand customer to know you have three or two years of warranty left on your second hand GPU We've lost that all today EVGA were my go to brand The only reason I'm sitting here with a Galax card is because thats all I could get my hands on during the shortages I'm going to miss EVGA I guess now my choices are Gigabyte MSI or ASUS for higher end GPUs Galax is almost always more expensive in my region or I hate their designs other than their HOF cards
Queen dies The timeline kingpin dies
It's really hard to make me cry I'm about to cry right now Please tell me I'm in a dream
NO Wtf
fuck
Holy shit
Woah this is rough this is why we need more companies in the GPU space I hope EVGA switches to AMD or Intel even though the video says they don't intend on working with them as of now
Good on them for standing for their principles
MSI
Will EVGA take their business to AMD
I remember getting into building PCs 12 years ago and my first graphics card ever was an EVGA GeForce 210 512MB of VRAM That was upgrading from using the integrated gpu in my Compaq bought by HP Desktop just to be able to play some decent games My second EVGA card was GTX1080ti FTW upgrading from the 210 My current ones are both the EVGA RTX2060 and EVGA RTX 2080 Super FTW3 I wanted DLSS and ray tracing support that s why I upgraded But I still like my trusty 1080Ti till this day Using 1300w EVGA modular psu gold rating It s sad to hear EVGA had to make such decision but I understand and respect their decisions Nvidia c mon man
I get why EVGA has to end the partnership When certain games were killing the 3000 series cards by denoising chips cost nvidia had a handle on costs for every board partner so EVGA took some profit loss So as people were returning dead cards during the crypto boom nvidia was raking in profits when EVGA shoulda had more freedom to do what they wanted
Will be switching to Amd The other AIBs for Nvidia are rubbish and the founders edition cards are shoddy
I never thought I d see the day
finally some people reacting properly to this news When I saw Gamer's Nexus pop up in my yt feed I was open mouthed and in shock This is one of those end of an era deals and boy am I glad I picked up my 3080 when I did
Wonder if Kingpin stays He can t stay on top of the charts every new Nvidia flagship anymore
When I one day replace my EVGA 3090 instead of selling it I will make a shrine for it RIP to my favorite card manufacturer
End of an era I only buy EVGA
Wait what 3080 screaming in the background
Wow They are the only brand I ve been buying too This kinda sucks
This is sad to see I ve only ever bought classified ftw3 cards
Wow how will EVGA make money I love their coolers for nvidia but the rest Meh
4000 series is going to be a disaster in terms of sales for a lots of reasons and EVGA knows that It seems that there is no best time to break with nvdia like now Things are going to be really interesting in the coming months
So who's going to be the go to manufacturer now I've always been a fan of EVGA support and their cards rarely came in DOA I've dealt with Asus and MSI support once and if i'm ever to buy a gpu from either im gonna get squaretrade or whatever other extended warranty is offered because their support is THAT bad Never had to deal with gigabyte support though anyone got a rating for them
That part about AIBs not knowing MSRP or chip costs until last moment is crazy This whole thing also reflects very badly on Nvidia I'm sure shareholders won't like it What if AMD releases a better lineup and Asus MSI GB don't feel like they need to bend over backwards anymore
Doesn t EVGA have a bunch of the top benchmarks That kind of sucks
fuck well i guess my extended warranty just dropped in value not wanting to make amd cards seems like madness i hope this is PR bullshit and they do stay in the gpu market
Always have gotten a EVGA GPU since day one so this absolutely sucks The services they offered around their GPUs such as their RMAs and Step Up program were hands down the best
I don't even know what else evga makes
NOOOOOOOOO EVGA was literally the only vendor I would buy GPU's from due to their legendary customer support This is terrible
Crap Guess I m stuck with Asus now I really hope Nvidia learns from this and changes their policies This is garbage and their partners deserve better
Weird situation seems like other shit is probably at play here With Nvidia over buying wafers and not being able to get out of it I wonder if they're forcing AIB to buy more too forcing the losses more on EVGA and partners or something Don't know much about EVGA ceo but it's very drastic to completely get out of the business that made your companys name just from what was described in the video I hope we get more info this is really interesting
This will of course create more supply bottleneck with remaining partners for retail as all EVGA customers pile into other lines
I've only ever buy evga I'm so lost now
Well fuck EVGA were the only ones in Australia selling 3000 series at MSRP after launch RIP
That s a lot of cash lost for evga so it must have been really bad
I only buy EVGA starting with a 9800 GTX and a 260 Core 216 in SLI
I m using EVGA3070 EVGA3080 for my first computer In my opinion EVGA is a brand that is thinking about the customers they really tried to hold the price and give customer more cards with msrp during the GPU shortage while other AIB only thought about how to earn more profits I appreciate them and good luck
I've had my evga 3080ti for about a little over a month I sincerely hope if I have issues support won't be another issue
I picked EVGA for their customer service and warranty They are top tier service I'm conflicted now
RIP been using eVGA since the GeForce 2 MX days Didn't think my 2070 Super would be the last card I purchased from them
I was so ready for a 4080 FTW
Bro amd EVGA cards boutta be gas
goddamn that was unexpected wtf happened
Well that s not something I expected to hear before the launch of 40 series hahahah
I guess they didn't like the artificial flow limitations for the next series Which means Nvidia can dictate the prices with their own products No real market that is It's almost a monopoly
wow this is crazy has something like this ever happened before A company just deciding to kill itself like this
So is the new gen priced so low that old stock is dead weight or so high it's worthless for AIB to have a small margin selling an handful of cards
I never thought I live long enough to see inter company drama that captures my attention
OMG
I feel nauseous
There is no way that EVGA can do everything it's saying Either they go under or they have layoffs They should really go with AMD Intel because they have good standing in the market they are currently leaving
This might just force me to buy an EVGA GPU since that deal is sealed now
Not a good sign of things to come from Nvidia
Anyone have pictures of the evga RTX 4090 prototype
My guess is EVGA overpaid for their chips during the crypto mania Now that crypto crashed EVGA has way too much stock it overpaid for they wanted NVIDIA to either buy back the stock or refund them some money but NVIDIA refused
Definitely going to change things It's so crazy they won't be in the GPU market anymore
you were the chosen one
And I thought this was going to be a good weekend This really
NVIDIA seems easy to hate these days All their anti consumer
Official statement m 3574574
This royally sucks I switched from AMD to Nvidia last year My first Nvidia GPU is 3060Ti I really like it Great for ITX builds because it is so small I hope Nvidia will come to its senses and make it right for EVGA Does this mean EVGA GPUs will depreciate more in value than competition This sucks Nvidia
Absolutely insane seeing this My first Nvidia card was an EVGA GTX 580 and honestly they're one of the very best cards on the market with the absolute best customer service This is going to hurt Nvidia a lot
Probably going to shift quite a bit of gaming to consoles
Honest question is now the best time to grab an EVGA 30 series
next in line will be Galax
I feel that evga will make their own gpu since they know people will love them they started already with the other peripherals i hope this will come true
Sad to see Got my first EVGA card back in 2020 when the whole shortage was going on and I thankfully was able to get one through the pre order queue process on EVGA's website Giving consumers that ability to at least be waiting in a queue was so huge and I ended up staying up all night waiting to check that box off Will be a memory for me for sure
EVGA is the only AIB I trusted My 3080 has been fantastic nothing but issues from the other AIBs Maybe a founders edition 40 series from Nvidia is it
my question is does nvida give a dam Evga was the best company and a huge reason why I bought their cards So my question is will nvida change their ways or are they going to lose more AIB's
How long did I sleep I slept for 9 hours and this happens
Oh fuck what does that mean for this 3070 I just bought
It's been a long time coming
I've always bought evga cards never had a single issue Disappointed to see them stop Wish the workers luck and hope there isn't
Damn Sucks Still going to buy just about anything I stull can EVGA
Novideo Seriously this is about the last thing i expected to see related to tech news up there with gigabyte producing a functional product
First evga i bought was an nvid 470
Evga and Sapphire the best AIBs I used to swear by asus but rma put me off them
This is not something I ever saw coming like ever
I think that its the best company to get a card with the 5 years warranty
Gonna miss EVGA they were simply the best I hope they can pivot to motherboards or something else
Since I ve only ever bought Founders cards and never had any problems I can only see a price increase in the market since availability will become even more limited as Evga were a massive part of this market Scalpers are going to love this News
Jon Snow does different things these days
The most shocking news for me in 2022 so far It's like if Volkswagen group announced they stopped making cars WTF
Nvidia goes Monopol
I only bought 4 GPUs in the last decade but they have all been EVGA This is really unfortunate
Man fuck this EVGA has been my go to for the last 10 years
I think there's going to be a cool down period then next spring they're gonna partner w Intel and release Arc cards and take them Arc to the level they need to be at to be competitive
So what does this mean in regards to who purchased the 10 year extended warranty on their cards
They had the best support New card no matter what literally I guess Nvidia didn't like that policy
Hope EVGA and AMD can make a working partnership
they had quality cards as of late quality for the money i wonder who can replace them in the field
EVGA Conjures VGA as in the video standard Makes you wonder if the company will rebrand
Toquezi ouserd impresso RH j
Now I want buy Google's TPU directly
Shame on nvidia Huang face vomitingface vomitingenraged faceenraged faceenraged face
I will never buy any Asus product
Hope they don't drop their psus I managed to get warranty transferred from a craigslist pc I bought
sadge
I wish he made his videos podcasts sometimes I just want to workout and absorb information
Nvidia is going the Apple way long term
Regardless of EVGA didn't the AIB partners profit like never before during the crypto craze or was only the retailers scalpers
Honestly I'm assuming there's way more drama here than there needs to be EVGA made 80 of their revenue from GPUs but that also made up less than half of their profits This combined with the shortages and sharp price swings due to crypto implies that operating the GPU business required much more effort than other aspects of the business while yielding a lower return on the time spent With the CEO now being in his 60s and himself claiming that he wants to spend more time with family after 20 years he probably just wants to downsize the business which means removing the most stressful and least profitable part of it GPUs hence why he chose not to expand into other product categories nor to partner with AMD Intel instead Obviously if that last statement turns out to be false and they start manufacturing GPUs for someone else then it would imply the relations with Nvidia are to blame
EVGA gave me an 2070 when i rma'd my old After that day i would only buy EVGA guess not
So you have a family that you care about Comfortably just buy XRP GT and earn big profit from it Most and best tokens are on
wow
Nice I just added EVGA to my cart on Amazon earlier today
They done
Glad I got a 3090 ftw3 when they were 1300
Will that all still be compatible
This sucks EVGA was my go to for GPU and PSU's
They were really the only company I actually trusted in the space Everything seems like a risk
Same I have essentially only purchased EVGA Guess I am moving onto Asus
Me too I always bought their parts preferentially NVIDIA recommend you send flowers apology If EVGA switches to AMD gpus I might have to follow them
PNY pretty good but Evga always was better
I hope they don't die like BFG tech Such amazing customer support
ASRock are pretty good from my experience Excellent customer service
I wouldn't worry too much once they feel the hit of that 80 percent revenue drop theyll be cooking off GPUs again They have something planned whether it be with Nvidia or AMD or even Intel We'll see them again
They were probably the last few that actually offer decent RMA services next to Xfx
EVGA has been my favorite GPU AIB as well Compact size reliable performance cooling good reviews I have a lot of confidence in EVGA Wouldn't have cared if it was MSI Gigabyte or whatever other brand
What about Gigabyte as an alternative
Just couldn't stand how ugly they made their
I'm betting a new deal will be back before the 4000 series release and this is just a strong arm negotiating tactic
My current and previous GPU are both EVGA
Even though I've only had AMD cards for the last six years I wholeheartedly agree with this Top notch cooler designs warranty transfers etc Not familiar with the step up program though I have their supernova 750 P2 PSU with a 12 year warranty lol That's how much they trust their products
AIB What s that
I've RMA'd so many Gigabyte boards and EVGA RMAs the one I had was so easy 20 series early on was a shitshow
Well the other AIBs still have to compete with nvidia which is one of the main reasons EVGA terminated their partnership
There was no competition NVIDIA was setting the max and minimum price they could charge for the cards They were also losing hundreds of dollars on 80 and 90 series cards It sucks but in all honesty other AIBs should do the same thing
Especially when they were arguably the highest quality board maker with the best costumer service in the US
My exact reaction I have no idea who I m gonna go with for the 40 series Maybe Asus This is insane
My first EVGA was Gtx470 and I never bought GPU from another company ever since Had one problem with 1080Ti after 2 years fixed under warranty and still runs strong Wondering how the extended warranty will work with my 3080 KingPin Damnit don t know what to do for next gem cards guess I m skipping 4000 series and if EVGA starts making AMD cards I m going to switch teams
Same I guess I'm buying AMD cards here on out No way I'm going to keep supporting a company that guts it's best partners out of greed
My reaction almost to a T There be some huge drama brewing behind the scenes for an S tier NV AIB to bail like this right before a launch no less You got a sneak peak of it with the 3xxx series where a lot of vendors were complaining that NV's MSRP for their founders edition cards were just not sustainable for the AIBs Wonder if something similar happened here but in addition there is a massive inventory of current gen cards and NV took the you need us more than we need you approach and EVGA called them on it
Yeah I really like EVGA
I never bought EVGA but I always thought favorably of them and recommended it to friends Thought about possibly buying in the future guess not anymore
I just picked up one of their mice for my steamdeck and its actually really nice I'm considering getting one of their mechanical keyboards but I don't know of any reviews so I'm scared to dive in lol
EU store is is basically empty at the moment Not that it ever had much inventory but GTX 1630 and RTX 2060 few keyboards and mice that's it
I'm worried for that too It's a worrying sign for the diversity of companies in the PC hardware enthusiast space
High revenue doesn't necessarily mean high profit though Sounds like profit margins were razor thin Jayz2cents video today is my only source on this though
I ve always only looked at ASUS and EVGA because of reliability cooling and product quality Always comparing price on FTW3 Ultra and ROG Strix cards pleading face
Asus is probably the only other company that even comes close to EVGA Their customer support is notoriously bad though
Yeah exactly L lol Mediocre keyboards mice and overpriced motherboards That's about it otherwise I'm surprised the didn't pick up a license with AMD instead or something I can't see this working out for them long term
I agree completely all my GPU s except for one over the years have been EVGA
I just switched to EVGA from ASUS for my 3070 and I'm super sad now I absolutely love my XC3 it looks fantastic with my gunmetal grey build runs super cool and the performance is amazing I also appreciated how they did the queue system during the shortage because it allowed gamers like us to actually get our hands on one
AMD likely has their own bullshit too lol and with the stake of Intel GPUs at the moment it s probably not a good idea to jump yet
You know I never even thought about Intel but if they cave this can be the beginning on Intel as a GPU manufacturer
80 of your company's revenue Much different than profit If NVIDA is putting them in an unprofitable position this move will strengthen the company
EVGA certainly didn't make this decision exclusively on their relationship with Nvidia The fact that they chose to leave the GPU market entirely is a solid indicator that their profit margins from GPUs are far thinner than their other product lines
another GPU partnership Incoming they will make new AMD gpus DDD
Given that the market is being flooded with used GPUs it makes sense that they are sitting out the market Maybe they will partner with AMD in a year or two when things stabilize
It's a private company It's possible it'll close its doors entirely when Han has had enough of running it He doesn't answer to faceless shareholders and investment douchebags
He's been learning for a while and he's definitely gotten better since the last time he spoke Mandrin on camera I think one of the first times he mentioned he was learning was when the cat case got lost in transit
Mandarin is my native language and can confirm it is pretty good
he's done videos on location in markets and factories with him speaking mandarin
Very informative and useful graph They really needed to use different colors than two shades of blue though
There was only one place in the US selling FE 3000 cards Best Buy and it was next to impossible to get one Unless Nvidia makes major improvements to their supplier delivery I don t really see how them squeezing out the AIBs is going to help sell GPUs You can t even order a freaking GPU direct from Nvidia and wait for it to arrive
It makes sense and it's all business I doubt Nvidia made any decisions with intent to burn their AIB partners they've just figured out ways and means to manufacture their own stock and sell it directly to consumers which is probably more profitable for them as a company I can see some AIB partners still making premium models for enthusiasts EVGA would fall into that premium category the trouble is they just have one of the more difficult paths to profit being a US based company Thus their exit from the segment
EVGA no doubt boosted the value NVIDIA cards by providing consumer confidence in NVIDIA products EVGA had the best warranties and now that they are gone the warranties offered by other AIBs may turn into a race to the bottom Transferable warranties to secondhand buyers were once common among AIB partners but now only EVGA officially offers this Resell values will no doubt go down across the board for 40 series cards because of this
EVGA's loose RMA policy was the main reason they were so popular Expensive high end GPU's can die quite easily so buying EVGA was a good insurance policy You knew that if the card broke randomly that you'd have no issue in getting it fixed replaced With other brands it's like playing Russian roulette where you either have no problems or you end up chaining e mails for two months in a row and have to threaten legal action or w e Nobody wants to deal with that crap hence they picked EVGA regardless of whether or not their cards were physically better quality
Yeah I've had GREAT interactions with EVGA I had a GTX 770 that ended up going bad while it was still under warranty Sent it in and ended up getting a brand new 970 sent to me because they didn't have anymore 770's Been an EVGA customer ever since then
EVGA picked up the mantle from BFG if anyone remembers them They had great warranties I even remember picking up a second hand card and they honored the warranty on it They did go out of business
Asus customer support is TRASH It took me WEEKS just to get someone to repair my Asus zenfone 2 back in the day Never again will I buy their products until they can sort out their customer service issues
Jesus How many GPU issues have you had
Agreed Best in the business on customer support It's become so rare
What do you mean by Asus running around Sorry I'm not from USA
How do you specifically have so many issues with GPUs
maybe because you are located in US ofc evga costumer service would be better than the one located in taiwan
Same I switched to EVGA from BFG c
Just checked my email been an exclusive customer since
I just purchased one of EVGA's 3090 FTW3 cards last week with the full intention of using their Step Up program to go to the 4000 series I've used Step Up many times in the past and it was always a great experience Kinda bummed I won't be able to use the program anymore I specifically bought EVGA instead of another brand in order to use the Step Up program Plus their warranty and customer service has always been top notch in the few times I've had to deal with them throughout the years Sad to see them stop producing cards
Yeah this is unfortunate Step up was my ticket to a 4000 series The most unfortunate thing is the EVGA employees that will be have been blindsided by this
This was my plan too I've been so close to pulling the trigger on a 3080 just wanted a concrete launch date on the 4080 before I did to make sure it wasn't going to be outside of the 90 day window
they were basically the last company that cared And maybe that is why they are quitting out of principle
Sapphire
Which is why only gamers are sad about the news They were the only ones who cared about us to try and get us atleast 1 card This is just sad
I haven't finished watching it either but I wonder how this will play out for those of us with extended GPU warranties if our cards die in a couple of years I definitely didn't see this coming
And from what I remember reading Nintendo only picked them because of a shit ton of leftover Tegra stuff They had previously burned Microsoft on the original Xbox End of an era EVGA was synonymous with Nvidia for me
Well when Jensen thinks that they are only one doing work and every AIB partner that works with them are leeches that are profiting off their work it s really easy to understand why everyone hates to work with them
Don't forget Linux
Not to mention Linus Torvalds flipping them on camera Yeah nvidia really seems to be terrible to work with
To add another data point outside of gaming I know government agencies you know small ones like the fucking US Air Force super computer projects that would rather and do spend tens of millions of dollars and untold research engineer man hours developing new GPU agnostic AMD friendly software than just buying Nvidia cards to use the CUDA ecosystem
Don't forget how fucking hard Nvidia screwed over Sony for the PS3 that it scared both Microsoft and Sony away from ever working with them again
Except for the hundreds of other partners that continue to happily work with them worldwide
They are a shitty company through and through
What did he say
Sapphire is basically the EVGA of AMD otherwise
Same for me I ve only ever bought EVGA
It seems as though they intend to exit the GPU market completely But I wouldn t be surprised to see them branch out into other products like cases coolers etc in the future possibly water cooling stuff too as well as expanding their line of peripherals
Nvidia Nvidia is going on
They show it on this video an bestbuy listing where the founder edition is cheaper but ironically the EVGA one is sold out
There was a time when the FE would be more expensive by 50 100 bucks over typical standard PCB ed AIB
The most baffling thing to me was GN mentioning that AIBs got the drivers after reviewers did Like what the hell How are AIBs supposed to know that their designs are good under regular usage conditions prior to release It makes no sense at all
I wonder why LTT wasn't speaking about GN's OG video
Interesting dynamic I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this but don't both announcing msrp to the public before than to the aib and selling fe cards at a lower price help consumers
Fuck Asus They still haven t sent my motherboard back after 10 weeks and countless phone calls
The ghost of EVGA is still a better AIB than Asus
EVGA says they don t have much inventory expected to be gone by the end of the year If this is the case they don t have much to worry about Yes with all the cards dumped from miner rigs it won t be easy to sell 40 series but people will buy new ones and EVGA also can reduce its output instead of just quitting the business It s Nvidia who needs to worry The company literally has almost 1 6 billion finished goods on its balance sheet on July 31 I also won t be surprised that Nvidia will force AIBs to buy 30 series and 40 series chips together as a bundle which would really screw AIBs over If that s the case then EVGA s quit makes so much sense
EVGA has been a big player in selling video cards to gamers decades before the crypto mining plague hit There is no way that the downturn of ETH or any other crypto is enough to cause a video card manufacturer to pull up their stakes and leave the market Gaming video card sales flourished long before the existence of crypto and will continue to prosper long after the crypto fad thankfully fades away I suspect this has more to do with EVGA leaving the market
Watching GNs video I noticed the decision was made in April already
This decision was made 6 month's ago
So EVGA really must believe the company can survive with this I hope so from the GN video GPUs are something like 70 80 of their revenue
Guess you didn't watch the video EVGA as in it's CEO doesn't seem to care too much He's probably just going to retire
Jesus Tech Jesus
It's unbelievable Literally all the questions here is stuff that has explicitly been addressed in the video
The only question I want answered right now is which brand to buy from instead
No one will Not a single AIB cares about that
Sapphire is similar but ofc AMD only
Recently yes because they were the only major AIB manufacturer that was in Taiwan and not China so they didn't have to account for the Trump tariffs Before that I don't think their prices were any different than the others
with the decline in GPU demand Not just a decline in demand there will be quite the oversupply with masses of miner cards flooding into the second hand market Give it enough time and that will result in a price downward pressure that not even new sales can escape
Microsoft Sony Apple and Nintendo all dumped Nvidia cause of their crappy behavior Evga is just another on the list
For every story like yours there are 20 people who weren't offered the same Not sure how you even pulled it off since they make it clear support will ignore any request related to the reservations
Two decades
Judging by the quote nvidia gave on the subject around the end of the video pretty bad
A similar situation in a different industry led to the birth of car dealerships and eventual cutting out of manufacturers from direct to consumer sales Ford was forcing dealers to buy inventory during the 1930s recession when people weren't buying cars anymore
Doesn't seem like it's going to happen unfortunately
There's a reason they were Nvidia only They were burned in a similar way by ATI years ago If they're going to come back it'll be with Intel
Sapphire Yes But XFX back in the day did nvidia too
Haha you re not wrong they disrespected the shit outta Europe when 3000 series launched Basically acted like nothing outside of NA existed
They are the only ones with short enough GPU to fit in my Meshify C front AIO Sad I was hoping to buy the 4080 Liquid
Did people buy EVGA cards for their Step Up program in mind I wonder
Steve said they're going to hold back enough stock to account for warranties and RMAs but once they're out that's it They're not making any more cards
They have to intend to have enough product to reasonably cover current warranties Or they'll exchange offer credit
im very interested
It's crazy how no one is talking about Nvidia and their absolutely shitty practices They treat their own aibs so bad that they are willing to completely stop business with them Fanboyism is a strong force indeed Yes they make good gpus but their anti consumer practices are ridiculous I hope AMD does better in the coming years and makes Nvidia hurt
do you guys not have graphics cards
I have gotten two of their power supplies one went to a friends kid and I think it failed but he also cooks his PCs and has fried several components and laptops across builds But still My other one is in a little hardly used rig and is fine It s a base power supply of theirs and seems ok but they aren t thrilling to agree with you Which is all interesting as in Jay s video he mentions they want to really focus or might focus on power delivery instead now Which I hope means better quality Their graphics cards were always good they got good reviews and the 950 maybe a 960 I owned years ago was solid Sold it years ago working just fine
I hope they become more efficient in the future The AMD cards have always seemed physically large in the past with very few options for small form factor PCs My evga 3060ti was the smallest card I could get for my current SFFPC There were no Amd cards that would have fit at a similar performance level That being said I have no idea what their next gen is going to be like
According to the video they are losing money on GPUs because Nvidia is selling them parts at very expensive price So they will have less revenue but not lower profits if i got it right
If it helps I have a MSI Gaming X 3070 and has been a dream to own runs really cool too Never had an issue with it would be happy to buy another MSI in the future
Also considering this The only thing Nvidia has going for me is their nvnec encoder which I use as a hobby to record my gameplay Was considering getting a 4000 series but this will heavily make me reconsider I was already looking into the AMD for their price performance If nvidia doesn't price their 4000 series card even close to appropriate I'm most likely switching to AMD
I'm leaning that direction Got a 3090FE and have the money ready for a 4090FE I was just about to drop bank on a Best Buy Total Tech membership so I had a slight edge to get a 4090FE when it drops But hearing this I've known that Nvidia was a scum company but seriously You have to REALLY be doing things wrong to have a business partner where almost 80 of their business is with you say fuck that I'm out
Apple Nintendo
I had nothing but trouble with MSI especially their RMA I tended to go with them because they had good prices When I receive defective card or if something like the fans fail on it their RMA is worse than non existent In my experience they keep sending you other defective RMA'ed GPUs instead of new or refurbished one until you stop complaining If I ever buy MSI product again I'm gonna go with a retailer with a good refund policy
Nvidia is taking such a large cut that AIBs end up losing money because the chunk nvidia takes is so big that it includes the AIBs profits as well
we don't know much nvidia is selling the chips for and things go up dramatically when they are rated for higher power temps etc 3060s dont use as much power so less heat wear etc
Nvidia has broken relationships with Apple Sony MSFT and others They all refuse to do business with them
The PCBs are still made in C
PowerColor is probably only a step down from Sapphire and still make incredibly solid cards I've never owned an Nvidia card but whenever I considered it the choice was always EVGA
homie it's a corporation there is no slut shaming Nobody in the industry would bat an eye about them getting a new partnership without a period of mourning It's shocking that they don't have a new plan lined up and ready to announce simultaneously with this I guess being privately held does afford them that flexibility
Sapphire gang calling you over
Its a bold move Cotton lets see if it pays off
They have keyboards PSUs monitors and motherboards
They have a PSU lineup as well
And PSUs keyboards mice headsets
PSU's as well
They could theoretically switch to being a design house They do the board design and some board maker buys the design It'd be interesting in a few ways because they'd be able to do designs for the full spectrum of performance quality
Many can't as they need the GPUs for laptops and pre builts and AMD doesn't produce enough
I don't think their 3000 series models were S tier but it's generally agreed that their customer support is right up there
Are the going out of business or just switching to AMD Intel cards Not out of business but not working with AMD intel Seemingly moving to different products PSU lineup eg
DLSS is still better and has more games with official support but FSR is making strides with every release FSR 2 1 cleaned up some of the motion issues and there s mods that allow you to upgrade in games w 2 0 certain titles w DLSS support Intel XeSS was recently previewed by Digital Foundry and it looks very impressive for a first release It ll be compatible with RDNA2 and Pascal cards once it releases
2 1 1 came out the other day no idea how it compares but 2 0 was already pretty good
I m going to be AMD only as soon as there its reasonable Sticking with my EVGA 3080 until then
Same here Sapphire here I come With how power consumption is looking on nv next gen yeah no
They have been doing that since at least the original Xbox All 3 console manufacturers used Nvidia exactly once No company with options deals with Nvidia twice
EVGA was one company that actually sold their cards at near msrp They ve usually been a pretty solid company
If you work with the assumption that NVIDIA's partners pre pay for GPUs and memory 3 months ahead of delivery and April was five months ago they would then be selling cards below their expected margin and possibly below cost in order to meet the MSRP for AIB models
Pretty sure they aren t publicly traded
You do that's why they pulled sales across their sites and online All their stock are for RMAs
Drivers Still made by Nvidia as normal
They'll hold some inventory for RMA replacement and stuff but once they're gone they're gone They're not making any more
Same Mine was a EVGA 750Ti 2gb
EVGA will no longer be manufacturing video cards of any type citing a souring relationship with NVIDIA as the cause among other reasons that were minimized EVGA will not be exploring relationships with AMD or Intel at this time and the company will be downsizing imminently as it exits the video card market Customers will still be covered by EVGA policies but EVGA will no longer make RTX or other video cards The company already made 20 EVT samples of EVGA RTX 4090 FTW3 cards but will not be moving to production and has killed all active projects pertaining to cards including KINGPIN cards
Done
Halfway through gamersnexus' video I believe they said that EVGA is not considering being AMD or Intel's partner for GPUs Looking at the timestamps there's a section towards the end expanding on it
this was evgas response We're taking into consideration how all the video cards we have out there under warranty including extended warranty and lifetime warranty cards We have pretty strong metrics to estimate what we need to support all warranties and we are planning to be able to support all warranty lengths as needed If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to ask Regards EVGA
Did you watch the video
They're obviously not the only brand but they're well liked
Or nvidia would know this beforehand because EVGA didn't order any gpus from them so they will divert the parts that would go to EVGA to other AIBs if they want them or more FE versions
No more EVGA GPU s ever not even for AMD They re completely ceasing manufacturing
Radeon Kingpins for our EVGA PC brothers
Bro nothing about this is clickbait They did terminate their partnership with nvidia They did cite disrespectful treatment Title is straight facts only
EVGA buys Nvidia engines and build a car around it but Nvidia also build cars with its own engine
They knew a while ago under embargo
You shouldn't delete your thoughts because of someone threatening you Report them and hold on to your free expression
Their CEO said that they won't be making more GPUs as long as he's CEO
I mean Radeon's market share is a third of Nvidia's and Intel for all intents and purposes doesn't exist yet and it's far from guaranteed that it'll ever really work out Switching teams would still be a massive shock to EVGA's revenue but they'd have to put up money to even start making those products This might actually make sense
But it has the ridiculous made up word frozr on it's name
Nvidia driver updates are on Nvidia's side
Graphics Cards
Because some people like watching more than headlines and consuming real details
Steve the dweeb aka mr 25 minutes Women can t last long enough neither can YouTube viewers
It's literally Gamers Nexus and also JayzTwoCents who literally sat in a room with EVGA's CEO that's some top copium right there son
According to them this information is directly from the EVGA CEO
the source is literally EVGA's CEO
jaz2cents confirmed it too
Given how evidence are words from Andrew Han I'd agree otherwise if they heard it through the grapevine
It dropped literally minutes ago and the source is an interview with the EVGA CEO performed in person by easily one of the most trusted people in the space At least one other YouTube JayzTwoCents also released a video at the exact same time
I can not imagine GN would run a story without being essentially certain it s accurate
Jay's Two Cents had similar vid but these guys share a lot of info perhaps
Two Jay who has a close relationship with EVGA for almost 10 years and GN
LOL Almost 10 years ago sure One crap choice doesn't change the fact that they were one of the more respected manufacturers for decades
Yeah 20 years of faithful loyalty to Nvidia and clearly after 20 years did I mention 20 years already 20 years of faithful loyalty as an Nvidia AIB and they are just unreliable they make decisions on an emotional whim
Did you even watch the video They aren't moving to AMD they're getting out of the business altogether
The classic reddit experience Doesn't watch the video Comments his facts anyway What a joke
Why would they possibly care if you bought AMD cards
Microcenter gives you a gift card so should have no issues there
They said they expect to be out of stock by the end of the year
Slowly over time the relationship between EVGA and Nvidia changed from what EVGA considered a true partnership to customer seller arrangement whereby EVGA was no longer consulted on new product announcements and briefings not featured at events and not informed of price changes On September 7 Nvidia offered via Best Buy an RTX 3090 Ti for 1 099 99 undercutting EVGA and other partners that were offering their products at 1 399 99 There was no warning of the price cut and it left the partners with little choice but to sell their inventory at below cost to meet the Nvidia price MSI dropped their price to 1 079 99 on New Egg and EVGA dropped theirs to 1 149
That's highly unlikely to happen The barrier to entry for GPUs is just too high for anyone to realistically break in Intel is struggling and they have decades of experience with iGPUs Apple probably has the expertise and capital but they don't seem to want to and it's not like they're going to help with competition seeing as Apple is what Nvidia is trying to be
BFGtech did it before back during the GTX 200 days
They will keep some stock for the foreseeable future If they run out and are still in business I'd expect them to offer market value for the card So if you have for instance an RTX 3080 and in 7 years from now it dies and they're going on eBay for around 150 USD that's probably what EVGA will offer you for it if they cannot replace it with another RTX 3080 All of this is my assumption but it is what I've had happen to me from other manufacturers when they discontinued products that needed warranty replacements in the past

Many might have but margins on hardware are limited and spread across first Nvidia then the board partner and whatever retailer they typically use too Also EVGA wasn t found like other board partners to be talking out of both sides of their mouth with no more stock for long term customers but then selling pallets to crypto miners as an easy and profitable sale EVGA seemed to focus on long term customers and gamers and I commend them for that They had the lottery line and tried to promote raffles and coupons for actual end users Nvidia made record profits I don t recall seeing Zotac or gigabyte shooting up the Fortune 500 list
Gainward did the same for a friend They don t keep the old ones too much
Sapphire makes excellent cards for AMD we got that still Nvidia was never to be trusted with anything so it sucks for smart buyers to lose EVGA on that side With time I've come to value noise level and quality more than ever Especially after buying this piece of shit gigabyte eagle 3080 ti which is apparently within spec only that spec is fine with 100 degrees VRAM Nvidia had it coming few companies seem to like working with them and that is for good reason
Asus is our last hope but they charge so damn much over msrp its hard to justify but i have had really good experiences with their products and warranty
Sapphire is awesome nearly EVGA tier Obviously they're AMD only though
The only one I liked prior to EVGA was BFG BFG had a life time warranty when most card makers didn't EVGA came along and offered double life time warranty AND the 90 day upgrade Wasn't hard to jump ship to them They've been my go to manufacturer for like 15 years now I guess it'll be ASUS now Or possibly
AMD GPUs are pretty solid devices for the most part
I was planning on a 4080 or 4090 I might just have to go AMD now This sucks
Zotac and Gigabyte are consistently good in my experience
Every brand makes good and bad cards sometimes TBH reputable reviews of specific models are all that you should really pay attention to
ASUS is the one
The thing is to me evgas been a risk for a while I tried to RMA a card with them No department in my country So i send it to Germany and it gets to them then comes back there was no one there to pick it up and they denied everything I ended up doing it through the shop i bought it from However their cards have always been good apart from that
They were the only reason I was able to get a 30 series at MSRP during the dark times I had mad respect for them big sad
ASUS has always been my go to for Motherboards and GFX Look at their cards Their custom OC cards are badass I've had their 1080TI card for 5 years now and it hasn't even blipped
Back when there were choices of GPUs EVGA was always a safe bet
Gigabyte is good
I guess I'll go to either MSI or A
Can't really go wrong with Asus GPUs either tbh My 1080 Ti Strix is rock solid and has been for almost 6 years now
To be fair there's MSI and Asus their both really good just typically more expensive
Maybe it s just me but I almost never see PNY cards for sale online Are they lower volume Asian Europe market focused instead
PNY is on my permanent no buy list since the days when they made GPUs with cheap faulty capacitors and then played word games with what they really meant by lifetime warranty Ultimately after a fair amount of back and forth they grudgingly replaced my defective GPU with a slower one Several of my friends were even less lucky My cousin got the worst of it when his his PNY GPU literally blew out and caught fire taking the rest of the system with it in the process and they told him he was out of luck PNY does not keep its word and does not stand behind its products
I bought a few of pny's cards and I'd agree Nothing special but not bad Just not at the level of EVGA I got spoiled for too long to go back to them
i will never purchase another gigabyte product i would rather no PC than buy another cheaply made GPU PSU that ends up being a pain to get replaced repaired If you so much as have dust inside your GPU they will not fulfill warranty swore them off completely over that
The issue with Gigabyte Aorus is their awful RMA Warranty support and its only been getting worse over the past 10 years Its at the point where I tell everyone interested in buying their products my RMA horror stories Between my own PC and family members PCs I've had 5 RMAs with their products and not a single time have I received a fully functioning product back from RMA In addition to that they had my motherboard in their RMA center for over 3 weeks then tried to claim that I damaged it I had photos that i took of the motherboard for shipping insurance purposes that show no damages When I sent those in a reply tot he email I was called a liar and they said I edited the photos to hide the damage I thought it was an isolated incident but I had a friend get his graphics card back from Gigabyte RMA with a giant gouge in the plastic shroud In addition to that I've read online about many other people who had their products sent into Gigabyte for RMA and after 3 or 4 weeks Gigabyte claims the product was damaged in the most unusual ways
They are probably the worst choice Personally I gave them a try on a motherboard and the software was disgusting especially the RGB software was like it was made from a 10 but also covered by a cheap plastic too They were reaching over 100temp and they made a dark spot on the back side of the board I presume because of the temps I ended up hanging a small fan near them to cool them
I'm not holding my breath but I hope this isn't the end
Add In Board partner
evga was the only real competitor to Asus when it came to the enthusiasts only other option for the High Tier AIB cards was MSI but thats a very very scummy company
Aren't we losing EVGA as a Nvidia manufacturer and thus have less options for buying an Nvidia card as a customer Wouldnt that be a loss for us as a customer with brands that have crappy non existent support Lastly what is this talk of them losing hundreds of dollars on 80 and 90 series cards Those cards were overpriced to begin with and Nvidia and the GPU manufacturers took advantage of the crypto boom to up charge the customers You still think Nvidia isn't making money on the GPUs they sell at the current prices
For 2 years now cards were sold AT A MUCH HIGHER price than MSRP and all the companies were selling pallets directly to miners Evga did too and was part of the problem these 2 years Now that mining is dead and the margins will be much less they abandoned ship I pity no company that fks up the consumer and cares only for their own profit Now the tides have turned though and they don't have the upper hand anymore and they sure as hell deserve what happened to them
They might have been losing theoretical income by not being allowed to scalp their cards during the shortage I can understand from a business perspective why they d be miffed that their cards were instantly selling and immediately listed for significantly higher prices On the other hand given the insane demand and limited inventory at the time there would have still been a scalping market even if MSRPs increased significantly because scalpers would raise prices even more The prices for cards could have been astronomical before demand died like 2k for a 3070 and the AIB manufacturers still could have been losing theoretical revenue compared to third party prices
How is Nvidia losing money on 80 and 90 cards
losing
Loosing hundreds of dollars Per card
I have no fucking clue what to even do now in terms of GPUs I don't trust Asus because their customer service killed me once EVGA has been my pick since their 680 I don't know what to do now
After this most recent generation I have to say I'm not impressed with Asus Both of my 3090s had rattling fans close to right off the bat Now that EVGA is off the menu I really don't know who I want to go with next
Nah fuck Asus While they make decent products like EVGA I've done 4 or 5 PAINLESS RMA's from EVGA from power supplies to graphics cards including a bricked 3090 from playing new world It was a fantastic straight forward process I've bought about 20 different Asus products over the years and RMA'ed one monitor and it was an absolute pain in the ass with them calling a smudge that they put themselves on the monitor as customer damage face with rolling eyes when in fact it literally had an internal power failure I've heard some similar horror stories about gigabyte MSI and other misc providers sadly so I'm not sure where to turn in the future but I will never buy from Asus again if I can at all possibly avoid it If you do buy from them and have to do an RMA do what I did before I sent the product for inspection for RMA and photograph it with something dated showing like mail or newspaper from every angle along with it in the shipping box and buy the extra shipping insurance because they will bend over backwards to not honor their warranties
I can't really see myself supporting any of the remaining AIBs Gigabyte and MSI are non starters I have no interest in paying the ASUS They've come a long way obviously not the same 'class' but they're passable now but honestly I might just switch over to AMD With my limited information mostly based off they won't tell us what the silicon costs alone I side with EVGA here I'm not sure it's a smart decision but I can 100 understand it
Wait until Buildzoid starts doing some analysis but likely the only solid comparable options are gonna be Galax or ASUS though ASUS will be exorbitantly overpriced for the performance Edit Fade me mods
Strix is the way to go now I think Gonna be expensive though
Dont focus on brands but on specific models I'd guess I have an MSI and it's great had a Gigabyte and it sucked Had Asus and they were great too But you can ask anyone here and they might've had the exact opposite experience with these brands but diferente models
Or go amd
I have no idea who I m gonna go with for the 40 series At this point I wouldn't NVidia has repeatedly proven it's not a company that deserves our money
Yeston Get a pink and blue card that smells like flowers
It's weird because EVGA has always been the best partner in my mind and I have recommended their products a lot yet last time I bought from them was 2x GTX 470 I would say gigabyte and MSI have had some great products too ASUS is good but generally more expensive
Rip to my hydro copper 4090 ideas
Asus does charge plenty higher prices though usually not worth what youre getting
Ya Asus strix cards have been the top cards on air for a while now
Was pretty much forced into Zotac from an EVGA 1080 last year since I could actually order one from their site Read so many horror stories After 2 years the card runs completely fine EVGA support is great I will say that People put way too much stock into AIB 99 of people buying these cards will never know the difference
I just bought a gigabyte 3080ti that s coming Sunday Always beeen team EVGA but couldn t find one without a markup Hope I enjoy this card
Looks like I m buying a 3090 Seems like an Elaine sponge moment
Palit
Asus strix line is the best quality wise They use much higher quality boards and chips in their gpus than evga Not my opinion gamernexus and the rest confirmed it when the series 3000 launched
I've used gigabyte since 2015 and theyve been amazing Had to RMA a 980ti water force when coolant shorted the card gave me a brand new 980ti and paid for everything
I m thinking either the Gigabyte AORUS with a water block or an ASUS with the Noctua fans
Wasn't ASUS named in the list of companies using slave labor in China
Whatever you do don't buy Gigabyte I had a 3090 from them that failed after a month and then a motherboard which suddenly stopped working one day They tried to claim that I broke a bunch of capacitors off the board when it just didn't turn on one day
yeah asus is also very reliable sad that evga is no more in the gpu space
Don't go Asus worst customer service experience I've had in the tech industry Took over a month to get an RMA and they made me pay for shipping on a defective mobo that was bought new and fried 2 chips because I wasn't sure what happened the 1st time EVGA leaving leaves a BIG hole I'm not sure any company can fill
Rtings did a few reviews I don't need a keyboard right now but I'd jump on that Z20 for 50 if I did Got the X15 for myself to play FFXIV been liking it so far finally an MMO mouse for large hands
From what I've seen they make good keyboards Everyone makes good keyboards nowadays though I would've bought one if not for the bigass EVGA emblem prominently displayed on the front I want a more stealthy design
I bought their mechanical keyboard for shits and giggles and its not a bad keyboard I still like my original corsair one more but it's not bad as a backup I swap them when I want something different
I have one of their 1st gen Z10s non RGB with the little LCD screen and it's been a fantastic keyboard And when my first one died randomly they were really good about replacing it I've had the replacement for a few years now
I've got a Z20 clicky Louder than I personally wanted but that was on me for buying
Get a custom mechanical r MechanicalKeyboards
You could make the argument that the diversity was lost at least for graphics when Matrox lost relevance and 3dfx went bankrupt It s really a duopoly at the consumer level
's margins on power supplies is thick af whereas gpus are paper thin which explains why it is such a high of revenue but not profit He also mentions in the video that at current prices EVGA is losing money on higher end 30 series GPUs 3080 and above
Yeah that seems like it was the main pain point with EVGA's leadership It's why I understand their decision to cut things off with Nvidia but their adamance to stop making videocards altogether is concerning Their other products include rebranded PSUs ultra high end mobos niche audio products and peripherals that hardly anyone buys I just don't see how they're going to stay afloat with those especially since they stated that they don't have plans to expand into new product lines
I guess Asus it is for my next card Or maybe MSI assuming they don't horrendously cheap out as they tend to do sometimes I used to run Sapphire cards when I bought AMD and they were so damn nice I wish they made Nvidia cards although after what EVGA has said about working with Nvidia I'm not sure if I blame them for staying AMD only
I don't know much about computers do you avoid founders edition for any specific reason
I've only ever had to warranty two gpu's one EVGA the other ASUS EVGA made me a customer for life with how well they handled it and ASUS made me swear to never buy an ASUS product again and I was an ASUS fanboy at that time
They might be under some NDA Contract with NVIDIA and can't say they are going to make AMD Intel until they are free of
Kinda reminds me of that picture of two similar colors of nail polish that were only one small shade apart Like damn make Nvidia greedy green and make EVGA angry red
They are also relatively small compared to the other big 3 MSI Gigabyte Asus These other 3 have other product lines they have been entrenched in while EVGA started off as purely a GPU company and only now starting to branch out to other PC peripherals
At the same time Steve said he heard a quote from an anonymous source at Nvidia so take that as you will that Jensen sees their AIB partners as leeches basically which is why the EVGA CEO said he felt disrespected
Sounds like nvidia doesn't really let AIBs make premium models They all have to spec within certain limits so that people are encouraged to upgrade to a more expensive chip than buy a premium model
This is specifically why I bought my 3090 from EVGA Sad times
As Steve says the CEO of EVGA respects their customers and don't want to sell to anyone who might tear apart the company's reputation He's a business man who runs the company how it should be done
Nivida have always been a shitty company unfortunately Yes yes I know no company is your friend Nvidia are highly anti competive even though they do make good products Everything they do is about stifling competition be it proprietory software and API's or misleading branding like when they incorporated Freesync and relabelled it G Sync Compatible I know I'm in the Nvidia sub calling Nvidia scummy but I say that as someone who has used and enjoyed their products but man they are a dick of a company
I hear ya
It means that they kept finding or making excuses to delay the process They hope that you get frustrated and give up They would transfer you to different representatives and make you explain your problem all over again They would ask for the same documentation several times and sometimes take up to a week to reply My RMA ticket would sometimes be closed without my consent and when I contacted them they would say that it was closed because the issue was 't Out of all of them ASUS was the most frustrating because they KNEW what they were doing
I provided context in a comment below
The fans usually give out from running at 80 24 7 They RMA them and usually send you a replacement card The cards still work just fine the fans are what usually give out
Yeah I'm actually a few minutes away from their HQ Same thing with Zotac I've dropped off cards to their warehouse before
And it's pretty interesting BFGtech had announced back in the day that they were getting out of graphics card manufacturing specifically citing the souring of the relationship with Nvidia They had also said that they were going to remain in business Spoiler alert they didn't
Ha Haven't seen that name in years Same BFG cards were awesome
BFG K
Same Bought a used 7800 GTX by BFG off ebay Turned out to be broken with artifacts all over the screen No receipt or proof of purchase they accepted RMA right away Send it in and quickly got sent a 8800GTS in return Was so happy Hope EVGA doesn't succumb to the same fate
Same here When BFG went away I swapped to eVGA for all of my cards I had an issue with my 1070 FTW contacted eVGA got a real person immediately and eVGA cross shipped me a replacement The replacement was a 1080 which has been going strong for years I have no idea who I'll go with now I've had issues with Asus and Gigabyte support in the past in that they take forever I've had no experience with MSI Maybe founders is the way to go now but that would exacerbate the problem I don't need a 3000 series since my 1080 is fine but now I feel like I want to get a 3080ti 3090 just so that I have an eVGA card for the next several years I'm hoping against hope that this will ripple throughout the AIBs and Nvidia will change their ways but I know that isn't going to happen
I mean you can always sell it for some money and get a 4000 gpu
Yeah fuuuuuuck I just bought a EVGA 3080ti will their warranty and RMA program still be active
I almost did the same I figured I'd wait for the 4000 series to see what happened to 3090 prices at least
What do you mean about the 90 day window
100 agree I can admire the CEOs dedication and integrity He also won t sell because it would mean they d be sell outs and the brand would suffer You gotta admire that
They're AMD exclusive
For those who don't plan on watching the entire thing they plan to honor warranties and have pulled back on some inventory to serve that function
I owned a XFX Nvidia card with warranty and they offered me an AMD equivalent Maybe EVGA will be similar
Sony too with ps3 Nvidia is consistently one of the most insufferable companies to work with
I'm really sad it was for me as well
Leeches competition a necessary evil One could argue that those things are exactly what partners are in business and using the word partner is just being diplomatic It's like that Churchill quote Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions But even if that were true there's still a vast difference between treating your partners as though you're both better off as independent partners rather than being too honest or paying lip service while you complain and let slip your ultimate goal is to buy out bankrupt the other
Maybe his end goal is to get rid of all partners
I think XFX got burned too
Linus and Linus both have beef with Nvidia
Are they happy though
Exactly what EVGA said but more bluntly
NVIDIA F YOU while gesturing with his middle finger
I have Sapphires 5700xt haven t dealt with their customer service are they also great in RMA and warranties
While I'm not stoked about their leaving the GPU space I will say their PSUs are really really good so they have a path forward there
Jensen Spatula the III
In Jayz' video he states that to honor their warranties they'll be holding back a percentage of the stock they have on hand for RMAs So that in part might account for the cards always being sold out
that just shows how fucking insane nvidia is pricing their gpu kits for AIBs normally AIB cards would still be priced unter the FE but greedy nvidia just hiked up the prices for AIBs over the last 2 generations I hope more manufactures drop out and AMD gains more market share fuck nvidia
No hashrate limiter so Nvidia sold a lot of founders in the mining craze
Not telling your partner what the cost of the gpu die is and not telling them how much they can sell it for is a big F U in business Selling FE cards at a lower price might be better for consumers but as a business partner it makes you question why do I exist
memory in a bundle to AIB partners with sometimes unrealistic MSRP goals Since Nvidia do not need to buy their own dies from themselves they get them at exactly manufacturing cost which is much less than manufacturing profit margin they sell them to AIBs for They then release a FE model that is profitable at MSRP while some AIB cards are not They do this too much and AIB companies stop making cards since it isn't profitable which hurts consumers again Also FE cards were just as scalped and impossible to buy as the rest of the 3000 series so it wasn't like they were helping the market with competitive pricing
Selling FE cards at MSRP helps consumers I guess in the sense that AIB partners can make fancier cards with better cooling and power delivery and then charge a premium for them So assuming that you can actually obtain FE cards then having them at MSRP is good for consumers I don't think that announcing the MSRP to consumers and PARTNERS at the same time helps anyone but nVidia however Because nVidia gets to set the price for their own cards knowing how much it costs them to make the components and assemble the cards they are able to determine a card design that is profitable for them while partners are left guessing at what to make On the other hand a partner has to buy chips from nVidia and lately it's not just the GPU itself but the memory chips as well which of course has a markup on it so nVidia can make a profit And apparently the manufacturers weren't even being told the cost for those components until the MSRP was released Then the manufacturers have to try to hit the MSRP that nVidia has set while having more expensive components because nVidia gets GPU and memory chips at cost Does it help consumers I don't know but it definitely HURTS partners and is decidedly very un partner like But that's why we saw some AIB partners make a small initial run of low end cards that sold at nVidia's MSRP and then all of the rest of their boards were at the higher end During the earlier days of the 3000 series cards when everyone was complaining about how expensive they were several AIB partners had commented off the record to places like GN and similar that there's no margin trying to sell at nVidia's MSRP IMO it helps to have more competition in the marketplace and losing a partner like EVGA that has been so strongly pro consumer is definitely going to hurt us in the long run I suspect that nVidia has taken a pretty big hit over this current iteration of crypto winter and they're intending to make up for some of that lost revenue by pushing their own FE GPUs harder than they have in the past I mean if you look at when it started the FE was a limited run card with a higher MSRP Then it was more or less an unlimited run with equal MSRPs to third part cards Nowdays it's an unlimited run with lower MSRPs While they originally stated that they weren't intending to compete against AIB partners it's now extremely clear that this is exactly what they are intending to do
Not really because it is setting up potentially unreasonable expectations to consumers and can create a whole lot of either consumer confusion or ruined expectations Think of it as if a display manufactory for a new panel and TV line came out and said the new TV's will be X price and they will launch a relatively small batch of TVs at that price before even talking to their vendors who actually have to integrate the panel to the TV make the rest of the TV and sell it in stores on if the MSRP is reasonable Then suddenly many of the TVs on the safe are not at that price because it wasn't reasonable Nvidia is effectively trying to strong arm AIB partners to do borderline free labor to carry the GPU's the last mile to uphold consumer expectations that they set without their knowledge OR they are trying to not be the bad guy when inevitably the price is not what they advertised when people actually get to buying it and it seems like EVGA etc are ripping people off with more expensive GPU's sometimes the case but not always
Issue is not telling them about the costs in general So basically Nvidia could sell FE cards at 10 profit but sell the tech to AIBs at 20 markup effectively making AIBs only profitable if they price it much higher than FE cards Basically the playing field isn't even It would be actually better for consumers if AIBs can negotiate better prices with Nvidia if they know making prices and expected FE prices but Nvidia is forcing AIBs to price them higher in anyway to make FE look better Ideally its better for consumers if there's actual neogtiation and competition
It's an unsustainable way to run a business though as a board partner since you have costs you need to budget for staff equipment consumables components GPU sales make up 70 of EVGA's revenue You can run a business if you don't know the very significant major component cost that makes up a massive chunk of the price until the day of the launch when you're expected to then start selling very quickly
Based on what was mentioned in the article they weren't making that much per unit compared to other areas like PSUs So if you shave off a already shaky market it's going to be negative AMD Nvidia are probably going to have to lower prices to compete with the new markets which is going to dig even deeper into this There is a point at which the amount of money you can earn and the risk of the venture makes it not worth it especially if you can look to simply leave it to fallow to figure out what's going on Right now is incredibly unpredictable and the next two months is going to determine a lot which as I mentioned pretty sure we're going to see 200 3080s That backlog from Nvidia is one of the symptoms of what lead up to what's going on right now That was the drastically reduced demand from crypto miners even prior to the ETH merge shows how saturated things are While people will always buy new GPUs cause they're new it's tough to recommend a 900 4080 when you can buy 4x 3080s for the same price
I m actually pretty sur this is exactly what is happening Like EVGA took a commitment of orders based on pre crypto crisis volumes and can t honor it now that demand is much lower Nvidia didn t accept to review the terms of the contract and this is why EVGA is now stating they are not fair
The kicker here is the fact that they didn't move to AMD or Intel as I mentioned in the post If this was a political move more then a business move they would've went there and they didn't This isn't a downturn this is a complete annihilation of GPU mining for 1 2 generations probably close to 2 3 years That means almost all cards that were being used for mining are going to market There simply isn't enough bread for the amount of mouths to feed
it does but the nail in the coffin is how the fuck they going to sell any card at all even with good margins next generation is royally fucked
Some question this chart eg PC Partner Zotac whih 87 revenue coming from GPUs post 2263934 Or gigabyte's revenue is only 45 GPU post 2263992 Their profit margins are going way up over this time graph is not matching reality
70 80 revenue means nothing if the profits were only 10 20 WHo knows what they were They even said in the video that their Power supply margin is 300 higher thus why work so hard for so little of the pie Edit Accidentally Quoted MB not Power supply
but not profits And they were losing hundreds per card on the higher models Now with the glut of cards due to hit the market and Nvidia being pains to work with the move makes sense
Redditors and not watching reading past the title Name a better duo
They did raise the price though I reserved a 3080 in the queue and I remember them saying they'd honor the price from when I reserved it instead of charging me the increased price I can't recall the exact numbers
Nintendo has not dumped nvidia afaik
Very likely EVGA will sit out this cycle and maybe the next one before they switch to team red or team blue Switching chip vendors can be very tough there is always a trial and error period designing and testing a new board before your engineers understand all the nuances and pitfalls a unfamiliar device has One thing I am curious about is Nvidia going to divide up EVGAs allocation to other AIBs Or are they going to keep the allocation for themselves for FE cards
Kingpin Arc line 5 years down the road
Yes I know XFX used to make Nvidia cards Just saying today they along with Sapphire are the goto for AMD like EVGA used to be for Nvidia
Was on queue day one for the vanilla 3080 FTW3 never got any notify email It sucks that they are the only aib manufacturer to make a solid case screwable bracket which I need for a project
Meshify C owner checking in I love this case because it's one of the smallest options that fit a full ATX motherboard but some graphics cards are just so fucking long I bought a strix 1080ti a while back not knowing it wouldn't fit Had to mod the front mesh panel to fit it I have barely any clearance on my EVGA 3080ti fits though
The wording in that video makes it sound like they won't have any replacement stock available by 2023 That's pretty shit if you have a card that's supposed to under warranty for another 5 years
Credit for what though You only need so many psus
My 6900xt fits perfectly in this tiny case
And it's harder and harder to compete with NVIDIA's vertical integration at EVGA's standard Their standard just makes their cards more expensive than a first party one Later in the video there's a statement by NVIDIA basically saying they'd like to get away from AIB at some point and move to a vertical integration like Apple
Definitely helps Thank you
Nvnec wasn't really going to matter in the future anyways because of AV1
I haven't heard of anything bad between Nintendo If you wanna share I'll take a look at it
Yeah but if my only choices are an American company with PCBs made in China or a Chinese Taiwanese company with PCBs made in China I m going with the American company
I had a hard time choosing between Powercolor and Sapphire made the switch from green to red with the 6000 series
Yeah except that with the exception of some of the power supplies they aren't really competitive with any of those other things
Amd decides on what orders to place with the manufacturers based on market demand and what the factories can allow If enough I ll will fell on them and consumer habits changed production of amd units would increase
Damn yikes I m sure their PSUs and Mobo s are fine but I never see them show up on Best of lists nor hear people seek them out as much as their video cards
This is Nintendo's first round with Nvidia though no
Truly a bummer if so Asus will be my back up I reckon Wanted the TUF card tbh simply due to a better cooler Thanks
Thanks I'm shocked Must be some serious shit that happened that they just decided they're done with GPUs altogether
Really fucking sucks for the people working at EVGA's GPU group I hope they are able to find other work quickly and easily x200B EVGA was my go to for GPUs for such a long time
I don't get it I haven't watched the vid but going by the title if they're being disrespected why not just go with AMD Why kill your business
Wait what so they are just going to nuke their main business income
They already make AMD Imagine a EVGA themed Red Team build
Yeah both of them but when it comes down to it its always about the money
I would agree But I was getting a flood of reply Saying but Steve or J
EVGA is bottom tier
Thanks for the Info
until the company itself says other wise take it with a grain of salt forum posted a hour
But keeping enough stock allocated for warranties and replacements I'm just curious about how long that will last
Apple could probably make the greatest dedicated GPU s ever created considering the talent they have on board I d love to see it but you just know it d cost a mortgage to buy one lol
did they also have 2 3rds of their company on GPUs
Condolences on that 3080 Ti Gigabyte's eagle series always were trashy
Funny it so happens I'm on third AMD card in the row and have not had any from Sapphire Had two from MSI and now from PowerColor luckily have not had a pleasure with either support as neither had any issues
Gigashit
Yeah It was easily fixable DIY but it pissed me off they let my aorus 3080 have 100 degrees VRAM out of the box
More like the screaming eagle eh
With time I've come to value noise level and quality more than ever Triple fan radiator and triple fan g card always running on 100 speed It helps me sleep
Recently switch to an AMD RX 6600 XT Was the only thing I could find in budget range even the 2060 super was overpriced haven't regretted it does what I need it to do It's an Asus brand though so might be why almost grabbed the sapphire version but ended up grabbing the Asus version still no complaint CP really pushes it but runs way cooler Almost bought an Asus RTX 3060 Ti but couldn't justify the 200 more for it But for now the card I bought runs great stable and runs CP at max settings no problem Using CP2077 as example since that game is harsh on the cards had a MSI 1060 6g before had no complaints with it the MSI mother boards though never touching those ever but for what they are and the lower price tag So far AMD is 1 for 1 on the vid card for me Nvidia has been a mixed bag specially on the price point and their third party manufacturers Think I might actually be done with Nvidia to be honest
100 degree vram is fine on GDDR6X
AMD is the future really Linux support from out of the box Come on
My sapphire rx 480 was trash may have just gotten unlucky I spent over a year getting artifact freezing randomly during games and sometimes just browsing web Tried dozens of drivers hours and hours of research Switched to EVGA 2060 gpu and voila fixed Never a problem didn't have to swap any other hardware out Not to mention the coil
I had an AMD Radeon Sapphire a long time ago before eventually switching to Nvidia and it was constantly running really hot even at idle Yes they may have gotten better since just as AMD's GPUs have though their GPUs still aren't as good as Nvidia but if I ever did go back to AMD I wouldn't trust Sapphire after my experience
The founders edition cards are surprisingly good Compact and overall very high quality shroud and heatsink I can see why evga would be mad that nvidia is releasing their own high quality cards while simultaneously undercutting everyone on price The only problem with getting the FE cards is that they're only sold through Best Buy and they're always out of stock due to their price I think this is great as a consumer but obviously sucks for the aibs that are trying to price gouge
Yeah I've wanted to go AMD for my last couple builds but what was stopping me was EVGA I've only ever bought cards from them thanks to the warranties and customer service and it was purely thanks to them that I was able to score a 3090 on launch day They went on sale early to longer term customers that had previously registered products to an account With all the love Sapphire is getting I will almost certainly look there first next time unless EVGA decides to partner with someone else
I have that same card and it s insane how loud it is I use it for a lot of vfx stuff and rendering so the only good part is I know if my render is still going because I can hear it all the way upstairs from the basement The heat from it is wild too
Seems like it's missing a non mandatory thermal pad Out of curiosity do they have warranty stickers in their cards Even though it's unacceptable to ship cards while going cheap on thermal pads I wonder if it's at least fixable without risking going through hell with the RMA I've heard warranty stickers are illegal but still some companies might be using it just in case
Asus products have been serving me good but their customer service sucks Also im still waiting for their cashback from 2018 Also they have made the applying for it hard as possible to avoid giving cashbacks as much as possible Also their own software sucks Points system is a joke All the bullshittery to just use the aura But 3070 strix cooling is fantastic It also feels premium Yeah im looking at you mr plastic shitabyte After all do not choose asus over some other brand if the reason for it is cashbacks any marketing gimmick Also take asus over gigabyte no matter what
MSI was worse during the shortage Their prices took the most advantage of the low stock and high demand
Asus are greedy Fuckers I wouldn't trust them
Gainward makes awesome cards But i think they only make em for the eu market
If you watch the full video you'll know why the AIB's charge so much more Because they are barely scraping out a profit NVIDIA is charging too much for the GPU and doesn't allow AIB to go above a certain price So they are restricted in what they can do which also explains why the AIB coolers are always 'cheaper' looking They have to do it or they won't fit within the limitations set about by NVIDIA who is free to sell their cards at any price since they don't pay the GPU fee
Does AsRock only do Radeon
EVGA overcharges as well but EVGA cards are subpar in comparison
Asus seem to do well by serving both ends I notice they have both the cheapest cards and the most expensive
I've got bad news for you lmao
What about gigabyte
I have two 3070ti s tufs from them that run so fricking hot it s crazy
My experiences with asus and gigabyte customer support was horrendous
Fuck ASUS all the way to the bank ASRock followed by MSI or Gigabyte I m not sure in which order
hahaha D asus motherboards of recent generation 1 x570 dark hero DOES NOT START UP sometimes and requires a full power cycle it has the biggest support thread on the asus forum of all time with 604 replies and 91k views this post goes back to july 2021 and it is NOT getting fixed nor are people getting told what exactly the issue is support will tell people to ship in their motherboard to get some refurb garbage and the refurb garbage boards get the same issue to show up within some time or instantely this issue exists for over a year and the x570 dark hero isn't even the only asus motherboard that showed this issue best guess asus knows that ALL x570 dark hero boards have faulty hardware but they wanna dodge a product recall replacement program 2 ASUS ROG Strix X570 E Gaming WIFI II 6 reduced all core performance compared to other motherboards from personal experience a 5950x on this board performs 6 lower or roughly 300 mhz lower than other boards on all core stock usage in applications like cinebench r20 that 6 lower score is compared to professional reviewer number's stock averages i am currently battling the asus support hell to get them to even replicate the issue they told me that they already did replicate the issue BUT that was probably a lie because now they told me that they will try to replicate the issue and will get back to me soon asus support also told me that this is just how things perform and i should overclock the cpu they actually told me that again at a later point asus support is hell and lies to you clearly too and can even damage your hardware overclocking is not without risk if psu cooling etc is not good enough you risk component damage or reduce lifespan beyond the expected by quite a bit think a shity vrm cooking itself for example having cheap caps degrade very quickly next to it 3 asus z690 hero BURNING UP A part was put on the wrong way inside people say that several standard safety systems had to be skipped for sth like this to even possibly happen think automated optical board inspection asus DID NOT do a proper recall of the product and 7 or 8 months later it just got fully started to get all of those potentially dangerous boards out of the hands of people so even a FIRE HAZARD isn't enough for asus to PROPERLY adress the issue v p8ktO WdlyQ v p8ktO WdlyQ there might be more of this story coming if freedom of information act stuff is getting filled and what not it is important to note here that issue can happen the question is whether the company did everything to prevent them from happening and adresses them properly if they do happen examples of proper adressing of issues fractal torrent fan controller issue evga vrm blowing up issue don't remember which one it was if you think it must just be the asus motherboard section the graphics cards should be fine WRONG the asus strix rx5700 xt seems like yet another product that wasn't even tested at all before they shipped it HardwareUnboxed 2 asus strix fix another defective radeon 3 HardwareUnboxed 2 asus strix fix another defective radeon 3 also notice how asus claimed that the issue is based on a bios bug and NOT a hardware issue yet it had NOTHING to do with software it is a clear hardware issue they didn't mount the cooler properly like damn clowns they don't even do basic performance tests on their products before shipping it is incredible so there is no good asus reputation if there ever was one then they set it on fire and spit on it for the last few years imagine not adressing issues FOR OVER A YEAR asus is terrible and should be avoided if at all possible which certainly can be hard i mean both asus and gigabyte happily set your house on fire these days and more
yup they charge so much but their cards didn't disappoint
Yeah sad but think I ll give amd a chance this time around
Ah so an empty apples and oranges comparison then great Useful
My AMD 6800 build quality is wonderful but I heard sapphire gets the same job done with significantly less weight Is that true
Unfortunately they don't have CUDA or OPTIX support so useless for many professionals
Gigabyte are not consistently good but not every card they make is horrendous The salt in the wounds is having paid so fucking much and still get a half assed product Usually you at least get some bargain with gigabyte but I'd say bargain can't be applied to the market these last years Not even at msrp
You technically don't have to download the bloatware however with MSIs case afterburner is actual quality software so I guess there is worse things
Peeny is an OEM they sell mainly through Dell and HP Get a prebuilt machine and more than likely there's a PNY made GPU in there
PNY make more workstation cards Maybe this will push them into making more gaming cards
PNY make the reference and workstation cards Gaming isn t their focus so they don t advertise much or make any real volumes They have the exclusive contract for Quadros and what used to be the Tesla line Way more margin
I purchase PNY at work They mainly cater to OEMs
Can't speak for how it compares to other places but here in the UK it's very common to see PNY cards on sites like overclockers They actually have a 12GB PNY 3080 and a PNY 3080 Ti in stock right now which is substantially cheaper compared to most other models on other sites
I've seen weird shops like Office Depot selling PNY cards Definitely the last place I'd shop for a video card though
sr 1 3 crid 3QH6OSW015EQ1 keywords PNY RTX 3080 qid 1663408544 sprefix pny rtx 3080 2Caps 2C58 sr 8 3 skuId 6509884 Probably just you or maybe you're not looking at the right websites
PNY is under Palit I believe alongside KFA2 Gainward etc they're all great cards
I have a Gigabyte 2070 Super where the 0rpm is horrible since the fans constantly turn off and on which is super noticeable so I just set them to always spin in MSI Afterburner My EVGA and MSI cards never had this problem with 0rpm modes
Thank you for your feedback For my whole life I have been an Asus EVGA and Gigabyte person And Crucial and Corsair for many other products of course I have not had a bad experience with any of those companies so it is good to hear feedback from others
Good to know I will try to steer away from them if they have a bad reputation My Gigabyte history is from over the past 20 years primarily Asus and Gigabyte motherboards so I am certain things have changed in that time It is shame that a decline like this happens with so many companies
I have heard nothing positive from them on here so it is good to know to stay away from them from now on
There are tons of enthusiasts who buy MSI and Gigabyte and also even the less common Zotac Palit Galax etc A lot of enthusiasts simply prefer getting founder's edition now because they are pretty much guaranteed to have the most options for waterblocks which is probably one of the reasons why EVGA is so upset with Nvidia
I wish I knew why MSI is scummy eyes
Galax with their HOF series is also solid with the enthusiast side
lol no galax hof shits on any Asus
Galax makes some pretty cool cards imo but yeah i guess
I guess there is HOF but idk if we count that fr
GALAX HOF are top of the line cards
Also MSI have extremely bad service I'm never buying a product of them again
But that's the problem Asus is the only one who challenges nvidia by launching really good cards a side from EVGA Other brands stopped doing it because of Nvidia limitations I have a GTX 1080 TI Fe that I bought second handed after the mining boom back in 2018 and I have a Asus BIOS flashed on it ASUS released a BIOS unofficialy that removes all cards limits and Nvidia doesn't like that
Aorus isn't high quality
I think the point is that EVGA is losing money not nvidia obviously Does not really make sense though Nvidia sends rebates to manufacturers when these discounts happen since nvidia holds all the margin on these that s standard practice
They made lots of money when the cards were overpriced they thought it would continue so they bought too many overpriced GPUs from Nvidia now they are stuck with inventory that they must sell at a loss
Nvidia probably wants this If their Founder's Edition cards were the only thing available then they can go the way of the Apple and set whatever price they want without the law as an obstacle
They were saying that they were losing money at current pricing which would make sense if nVidia charged more after they found they could amp the pride because of miners The margins for AIB has always been super low so having to drop the prices to below MSRP in a lot of cases definitely could affect them They also said it was only on the higher end While I don t believe it s as bad as they say they bought in at a higher price and had to then eat the cost of lower prices sales Poor decision on their part sure I 100 think they handled it poorly I also hate that prices were jacked up to begin with But there very well may be some truth to what they are saying
All the silicon was bought years ago at very high prices for a SoC thats expensive to board out EVGA is the most consumer friendly company when it comes to warranty design quality and direct to consumer scalping protection You're comment would hold some weight if they were fraudsters But they are arguably the best AIB
From my understanding they're losing money on the current prices below MSRP E i after the recent price drop they had to do to get rid of the ton of remaining 30 series they have in stock
Nvidia isn't the AIBs are
Not Nvidia EVGA Probably because their quality was higher than other vendors and therefore cost more But Nvidia was dictating MSRP
EVGA was not Nvidia
their customer service killed me once damn rest in piece bro
Guess there is only one thing left to do A770 limited edition Start praying now that it gets released
We are literally stuck with Asus and their gaslighting customer service and gigabyte with their faulty designs and faulty RMA replacements MSI i guess they are okay nothing good or bad about them I will frame my 980 Ti Classified that i have laying around to remember them
Idk but I'm riding my 3090 ftw3 until the wheels fall off Glad I didn't get the extended warranty
I ve been using MSI GPUs since I started building pcs back in 2015 and they have been great thumbs up light skin tone
Buy with credit card that has extended warranty
You can't go wrong with Msi
Buy a very cheap used 3090 or something You will have so many options very soon this is not the time to panic at all if you must have top of the top stop being a sucker Take advantage of this situation kick the miners in the balls give nvidia the finger They'll try harder to appeal to you with the 5000 series or be forced to release actually sensible lovelace gpu's with time
I don't know what to do now time for gaming consoles then
I'm not impressed with EVGA since I'm on the 3rd card they've sent me 3090 FTW was poor quality
I've dealt with a LOT of RMAs over the years with a lot of companies and I haven't found anyone that was anywhere NEAR as easy to deal with as EVGA The fact that their techs didn't seem to have a mandatory script was a huge plus as a technical user I could call up and say I've got gpu artifacts I did a driver reinstall and swapped the card to another system problem follows the card and that was literally all the troubleshooting needed
Yes Asus RMA sucks I sent my Laptop in for repair because it was randomly crashing when moving Even after these 3 repairs the problem was still there and they refused refund me because Asus said that the vendor has to refund me and the vendor said I only sent it twice and I need to send it in 3 times for a refund which in their POV is correct because for the 3rd repair I skipped the vendor and went straight to Asus because all they did is tell me to go to Asus I know that's my fault I should have always gone through the vendor but it's still bad practices from the vendor because I even send them confirmation of all 3 repairs and they could have just asked Asus And the plot of the story is that after the warranty ended 2 months ago I took the laptop apart myself and removed the SSD and the heat sink from it because the behavior and error codes were pointing to an SSD failure and put it back together and it hasn't crashed a single time since then
Who else can be trusted now MSI Gigabyte
You should probably mention that this info is not relevant to EU For US it is quite important though
Yeah that's the sad thing Asus makes amazing hardware but it's dampened by their support I have a 3070ti TUF and the cooler is incredible
I ve had similar issues with their shady ass RMA process that now anytime I RMA to them I take photos of my item before I ship it off in case they try to be slick
I have had a 700 900 1000 and now 3000 series GPU from EVGA and they are all still working as expected I have had two GPUs from Asus and had to RMA one of them twice A 50 rate of failure as far as my purchases go At the same time I've been using ROG mobos for a decade and never had an issue with them
It s so good living in a country like Australia with actual consumer protection We don t have to worry about this shit at all Something breaks or doesn t do the thing you wanted it to do you return it and get a refund or replacement and it s your choice
I RMA'd 4 Asus Monitores because they sent me faulty or deffected one as replacement The last one had also some white pixels but unfortunately I found it out just after my Warranty ended I will never ever buy Asus monitor again
Gigabyte blamed me on a manufacturing defect when I RMAed my motherboard because the Gigabyte BIOS update app permanently made the LAN controller disabled for good
With ASUS I RMA'd the same motherboard like 3 fucking times before they sent me a new one I had to pay for shipping each time and didn't have my gaming computer for like 2 months
I've RMA'd Asus GPU mobos issue free twice before but my friend had a near identical experience as you when RMAing a monitor
It s so good living in a country like Australia with actual consumer protection We don t have to worry about this shit at all Something breaks or doesn t do the thing you wanted it to do you return it and get a refund or replacement and it s your choice
I mean if you've had to RMA 5 EVGA products that doesn't sound very good to me I'd rather buy a brand where I don't have to RMA anything to begin with or at least a very very microscopic percentage of the time 5 times is a lot I've bought 3 EVGA GPUs and 2 of them had problems So after the second time I stopped buying EVGA I've bought 6 MSI GPUs and 1 had a minor problem for an extra port that I didn't need to use so I just kept it
Asus had a replacement 1080ti to me 9 days from start to finish One of the most painless rmas I've experienced
I had flawless Asus RMA They immediately shipped me a replacement with next day shipping no questions asked I'm sure every company has both good and bad experiences
to be fair that depends on region by region basis or even country
I've had three RMAs with Asus and all have been quick and painless without any issues
Don't forget about PNY Granted the last PNY thing I bought was an 8 MB DIMM of RAM
Honestly I think this is the one that makes me switch Go for the shared graphics cpu combo I would never consider having anything but nvidia but I just hate bullies so much This and the price fixing that came out of the quarterly I can try amd for a generation how bad can it be
I've had an MSI 3080Ti for over a year no problems with it
Now that EVGA is gone AMD only AIBs run circles around Nvidia only XFX PowerColor and Shappire imo are way better than Zotac and PNY
GamersNexus s mention of how Nvidia s CEO seemingly has the opinion that their board partners add little value is astounding to me I hope many people switch over to AMD because of this so Nvidia can begin to appreciate the work their partners have to put in
Zotac was amazing brother had always EVGA but zota 1080 and 2080 ti we competed againts were higher clovked
I've had 9 gigabyte aorus cards since the 900 series none have had issues
What s wrong with Gigabyte I ve had a 2080 S OC 8g for a while now that has been excellent I also have an Aorus Master Mobo that s never had an issue I just hate the gigabyte bloatware so I don t use it
What is the Asus tax That they build a ton of Strix cards and almost no TUF cards so they can charge a premium I was bitten by that when I got my 3080 I paid an extra 150 before taxes
Galax make really good cards but they don't ship worldwide unfortunately
Z OMEGALUL TAC
I think I'm gonna get it I've been wanting the corsair k100 cuz im a fanboy but the final notes about their similarities won me over Thanks man
That's the problem with mechanical keyboards if you find a great one you don't really need to switch to a new one for a long time if ever
Let's hope Intel doesn't give up after ARC We really need a 3rd vendor
They make the same profit from 60 of their gpu sales with 20 psu sales It's 78 gpu 20 PSU 2 misc for their revenue with 300 higher margin on PSUs no wonder they want to pull out
Is it possible that their reputation as a graphics card manufacturer drives a good chunk of demand for their PSUs My impression is that many people put a lot more effort into choosing their graphics card I can easily imagine that they then just grab an EVGA PSU because they already know the brand
I would not recommend MSI I was only able to find MSI 3080 and 3080 Ti for my more recent builds and have random issues with both Also can't overclock worth a shit My EVGA 1080 Ti FTW3 lasted a few days past warranty and EVGA immediately sent me a new one got it within two weeks I've also got an MSI motherboard that I'm replacing this weekend and I have weird system issues and their software is super bloat
It s not necessarily a bad choice but I prefer much better cooling much less noise and more overclocking possibilities
Gigabyte and ASUS are especially large they routinely trade places with eachother for 1 mobo manufacturer in the world by volume If they exited AIB partnership it would not be too big of a deal for either but EVGA is centered around gpus
Jesus Christ I'm never buying an ASUS product every again in my life what you described is pure horror and total cancer the kind of nightmare situation where you can't sleep for days
Yeah The only thing EVGA has going for them is they do have other product lines and unless the CEO is misdirecting it sounds like they're sitting on a glut of cash from the last couple years to tide them over while they decide where to go from here I'm forcing myself to be optimistic but I really do hope they can pull something off
The original step up program
Better hurry cause gpu mining just died when eth went proof of stake 5 to 9 milllion GPU s will hit the used market in the next 2 years
They're keeping some cards in stock for RMA but if it dies after mid next year I would not count on it being
Yeah Steve said they're going to honor the existing warranties RMA so you're golden
I have a Sapphire 5700xt but haven t dealt with their customer service Are they also helpful like EVGA for RMAs
Sapphire is the only AMD AIB whose cards failed in the warranty period for me I've not bought a Sapphire since then ASRock and PowerColor are the go to brands for me on the AMD side
Well Sapphire is just Zotac Same company
There is another
I've only had two GPUs in my life an HD4850 and a Vega 56 current Both Sapphire both awesome The HD4850 still works to this day They've got a loyal customer for as long as I'm buying AMD
Still they are a GPU company sell lots of GPUs and have very good customer service basically just as good as EVGAs
Do you still wanttl to buy Nvidia GPUs at this point I know I dont
According to the video EVGA is completely leaving the GPU space and won't be making any AMD or Intel either
In the video they quote EVGA in that it isn't planning on entering a partnership with AMD so I don't know if that will happen
Good point I only remembered the CELL processor and forgot about the Nvidia GPU for the PS3
Kinda sucks that if you want a high end GPU with all the latest bells and whistles ray tracing you're forced to go with them AMD is still not quite up there on the high end market feel free to correct me if I'm wrong it's been a little while since I've ate some really in depth benchmarks reviews since I usually care when I could afford something something is in stock
Same
Founders cards don t exist outside of US CA and Europe though Nvidia doesn t know how to do logistics it isn t Apple and that is why it needed partners Even in the US It was exclusive to a single retailer and hardly pushing out enough units EVGA felt like it had better production than anyone else
Not maybe that s the goal
Speaking frkm experience many of them yeah This isn't exactly a black and white issue partnerships in this area are hugely complex and beyond the nuances that reddit is capable of
Yeah Sapphire is great at that
Then the manufacturers have to try to hit the MSRP that nVidia has set while having more expensive components because nVidia gets GPU and memory chips at cost They also have to hit that target without explicitly being informed of what that target is They have no idea what their margins on the boards they are designing will be until nVidia announces MSRP publicly That's a pretty terrible position to be in
EVGA alerted Nvidia to their decision in April This has nothing to do with the crypto crunch
No the kicker here is that Nvidia simply squeezed their AIB partners too hard and kept all the profits for themselves This isn't exactly new to Nvidia It has been common knowledge for decades that Nvidia acts like dicks to their partners AMD already has Sapphire so AMD doesn't really need EVGA Rather than keep getting kicked around by Nvidia EVGA chose to leave the video card market and focus on their other product lines motherboards keyboards power supplies etc Please stop trying to push your theory that crypto mining is anywhere near that important to video card makers Video gamers were buying up 100 of the production of AMD and Nvidia's high end cards for many years prior to crypto and will continue to do so long after the crypto fad is nothing but a footnote in Wikipedia
Power supply margin was 300 higher than gpus
You're out by a factor of 10 Margin on video cards is about 2 according to GN It's an incredibly tight space to work in especially when the supplier of your key component is also in competition with you and can undercut you hugely with the Founder's Edition Now that the mining boom is over EVGA is losing hundreds of dollars per card on the current price of high end cards since their costs to buy the chip from nvidia is so high
As someone who used to work in distribution if they are making 5 I would be surprised Nivdia have killed profits at the high end with the founders cards that the AIB's literally cannot compete with There's no space to compete at the lower end of the market So all that leaves is the mid range cards Ask yourself this If you were EVGA how long do you think Nvidia is going to let you make money on the mid range stuff It's very obvious that Nvidia want to supply everything themselves So far this has happened at the high end but the mid range will happen before long EVGA have jumped before they were pushed
Their CEO EVGA said that they won't be making GPUs of any kind for as long as he's CEO
The only notification I got was the cancellation of the queue now that stock is high enough to not need it A bit of a joke but I got a card from my preferred retailer that week so want terrible But not great either
Exactly I asked about getting a prorated refund in another thread but everyone's like bro they said they'd honor warranties Ok 4 years from now how the fuck do you honor a warranty if you don't have GPUs available to do it
Got a extended warranty for my card kind of upset now as that pushed my warranty to I think around 2028 or so
The wording to me sounded like they're expecting to run out of general sale stock by 2023 but they're keeping some back for warranties replacement separate to that stock
Death knell for Nvidia
I think they meant Sony Nintendo s one of the few that still use NVIDIA and that s because they got a wicked deal on those Tegra X1 chips If they can t get a decent deal their next go around I imagine they ll go with someone other than NVIDIA
According to the ceo they make 300 the margin on the PSUs than they do graphics cards and its 20 of their revenue source 78 20 2 split for GPU PSU Other They own their building and dont owe any money on loans or anything I think they will just wait it out and see if AMD is interested or maybe intel will see this as a good way to push forward with GPUs after all They could get their own well known AIB building cards for them
Sure but that also assumes some pretty heavy assurances from AMD's partners that they will actually buy up the increased production of course it also assumes AMD will get enough wafer allocation in the first place their CPU demand still dominates
They have some of the best quality PSUs on the market It's pretty silly of them not to have something setup with AMD Intel otherwise i see them going out of business faster then they think
And possibly last
Nvidia happened LOL
Probably been burned too hard by Nvidia and don't want to deal with other companies' bullshit etc
I mean they could be riding the black so hard the company just isn't profitable with the cards so loosing the cards and then all those salaries might be a win for them financially
They're apparently actively losing money on the GPU side of things Trimming GPUs means lower revenue but a higher profit margin it seems
Steve explained it with quotes from the CEO The GPU division was 78 gross revenue and their PSU division was 20 gross revenue The problem was the PSU profit margins were 300 more than GPUs With current GPU prices they were losing hundreds of dollars selling Nvidia's current flagships 3080s and higher The lower tier cards were still profitable but only because the mid range offering is still stupidly overpriced and not at MSRP
70 of their revenue but the margins are very thin They make 300 times Edit percent more profit on PSUs compared to GPUs per unit for example Also now the mining boom is gone they're losing hundreds of dollars per high end card sold because the price of the chip from nvidia is still very high They've decided it's not worth it any more since this happened to them during the 20 series too Edit times to percent correction
It takes a while to establish something like this so even it's something they want to do there's no point to announce it now
No worries It can be a bit intense sometimes especially when people are emotionally charged they may say some horrible things But you're not wrong for voicing your thoughts on things and nobody should have to feel intimidated or threatened into being silent it's just discussion Best of luck
Negative Zotac is
They literally say the source at the start of the video So either this meeting never took place and they are lying or the CEO sarcasm filter was busted that the clarification questions got an incorrect answer That's the only way their source of information isn't trustworthy
You don't look at the fact that BOTH of them released the news at 12pm PST and think that maybe there was an NDA on the meeting that lasted until thst specific time You actually think that BOTH of them would torpedo all their vendor relationships by releasing false data like this Like what was said top tier copium from you That or literally just room temp IQ levels face with tears of joy
This isnt a small rumour mill It was an official meeting with the CEO that had an embargo on the information
The company literally got both of them into a meeting that was 4 hours long its not BS
They'll save cards for Warranty purposes but I expect those to run out within the next 2 years You should not expect anything beyond that
They do know the failure rates and the number of warranties sold They've been doing the extended warranty thing for long time I'm pretty certain they know how to play this one they've been around for a while Very sad to see the end of EVGA GPUs though
Yeah they were much like EVGA Mostly known for graphics cards but dabbled a bit in other stuff like PSUs They even had a lifetime warranty on their graphics cards similar to what EVGA used to have
My powercolor has been good as well No idea what the reputation in general is
I've had 4 gens of AMD cards 5870 by Powercolor rx 580 by Sapphire 5700 xt by Sapphire and currently on 6800 xt by XFX Only Powercolor had issues but I think it's due to the crappy drivers back 10 years ago Had to underclock or bf3 will crash This is in stark contrast to my Nvidia cards I RMA'd GTX 680 palit 780 zotac 980 and EVGA 2070 due to artofacting Had 1070 armor by MSI which had crazy coil whine My Zotac 1080 ti evga 3070 worked well though
I've used Asus PowerColor and Asrock in AMD and all three are fine Though I'd be wary of the Asus they did mess up a few times 5700 XT TUF
Once you do get one it'll set a golden standard for you They don't even cost any more than budget cards not by much That extra 10 30 bucks you may spend all goes to a properly designed product They have easily replaceable fans too It really is the better product t 435 Check the whole review the pulse does very well in every category and it's cheap it also manages to be very quiet
If fighting is sure to result in victory then you must fight sun tzu said that
Next time get a sapphire they're EVGA or Asus tier good
I've never been so close to the thermal limit on any card I don't buy that bullshit
Even my Inno3D X3 3070 Ti does better temps than those Gigabytes so no it's not fine
But they are A major ODM backing out may in short term bare no apparent consequences that certainly won't bode well in partner confidence and Nvidia will pay for it sooner or later
As much as I like Linux it's pretty much meaningless when it comes to the desktop especially its influence on desktop gaming GPUs
Highly demanding games don't tend to support a Linux though There's a give and take
Yeah next time I have differently buying an AMD card
I couldn't care less about that I mean great for those who do but it's not something that I would factor in as a pro or con
any card can die and also not every generation is a guarantee always look your purchases up to be sure My only ever dead GPU was a gigabyte rx 580 It may well have died had it been a sapphire but you bet your ass the sapphire was cooler and quieter and just better built And that is something you can control to better your odds on this
Yeah sapphire have a track record of solid amd cards take it or leave it People said the same thing about AMD CPU's a long time ago today that's worth jack shit
I just wish they made the 3080 ti large enough to proper cool it The high end FE feels more like an attempt to make it fit in smaller cases rather than actually make it good The cooling is really smart but these high end ampere cards are simply not meant to be compact In my case it'd be a complete waste to put a compact FE card in there I have enough room for any cooling solution so fucking build one look at the 3090 ti that's what an ampere card looks like if you take cooling seriously
in america I think you got legal precedent to do this But not sure here I have five years warranty by consumer protection laws I honestly welcome this card dying soon to get a refund for that ridiculous amount of money
Asus products have been serving me good but their customer service sucks Also im still waiting for their cashback from 2018 You remind me that I too have a long forgotton Asus cashback that never came in
Gigabyte is the worst
I was Warting for Winter cashback 2021 and After 6 month and two contacts i geht it
Strix has always felt like the most premium of the mainstream GPU tiers excluding Kingpin Galax HOF etc in terms of the best cooling and build quality The only issue is the ASUS support generally not being as good as EVGA I have an MSI 3080 Ti Suprim X which is generally a good card but the memory still runs extremely hot In retrospect I wish I had ponied up the extra 50 for a Strix Lesson learned
Naah In my experience Msi's gaming x trio cooling is much better compared to Rog strix I have both 3070s and Msi never reached beyond 65C whereas strix can get high as 68C 69 on full load I agree that Strix looks more premium though but don't let that fool you on other aspects
Why are u even waiting for cash back from a computer part seller Call you bank and tell them your credit card was stolen and you have no idea about that charge of money Then your bank will investigate and remove the charge and issue you a new card in 5 7 business days This is always the case in the US But if u have already submitted a claim to ASUS then ASUS already got the proof that it was obviously you who conducted the purchase and your bank will definite won t retract the charge so next time just call your bank get your money back in 5 7 business days then sell your GPU to someone else or throw it into the trash can if u don t care that much
Asus Phoenix 1660 Ti Cerberus 1060 Most horrible cooling ever Asus makes some of the worst budget cards you'll ever see Might as well buy AFOX or Inno3D
Once you have their money you never give it back Basically the first rule of acquisition
The cashback process is very slow for sure I bought a B550 board from them and got my cashback four months after I applied for it
But 3070 strix cooling is fantastic Given the premium they charge and the fact that a midrange card doesn't need this level of cooling that's a small consolation These types of SKUs have no good reason to exist for anything but the 80's and 90's they just get away with making them because most hw buyers aren't the smartest bunch
Also take asus over gigabyte no matter what i mean they both are setting your house on fire possibly asus v p8ktO WdlyQ v p8ktO WdlyQ gigabyte v 7JmPUr BeEM v 7JmPUr BeEM at least asus didn't attack the tech press after the z690 burning up issue was pointed out while gigabyte actually did try to throw sh1t on gamersnexus testing methodology after they exposed gigabyte psus sparkling themselves into a firey grave i'd say both are bottom tier horrible garbage companies that don't see quality or customer support as having any value
Cash back from 2018 You'll never see it LOL
MSI is just scummy in general with mediocre products
this is Nvidia subreddit bro 40 of users here Asus fanboys remaining 40 are evga fanboys who are now in coma after this new news
yep AsRock is AMD only afaik
Their ftw3 line was consistently at the top of the charts with every
Bozo comment
lmao clown face even during the height of the shortage EVGA was regularly the cheapest i purchased dozens of cards to mine on so its not just a one off experience they consistently had the cheapest options and least problems with cooling ftw3 being the best xc3 being adequate for most evga cards 3060 3080 where only the 3090 started to show signs of requiring a beefier cooler always had to sacrifice hashrate with 3090s for cooling
This is where the problem with Asus comes into play They will go the extra mile for their top end usually strix products when they charge that premium Asus tax you get what you pay for theres no there are worse contenders but compared to their strix line TUF comes across as them having the eh thats good enough just ship it mentality
EVGA also had problems with their 10 series cards I dont think its fair to test a 10 series in 2022 and say yup just as i suspected this company sucks Plus his findings were oh no they didnt put thermal pads in the right spot Ok then send the card back and have the company stand by their product If they dont THEN call them out on it and hate on them thats perfectly fine We all have experiences with a wide range of products and every now and then you get that one repeated problem that make you go you know what never again im the same with Gigabyte
hell no not for me anyway if others wanna go through them and trust them more power to those folks but personally i will go out of my way to filter out their products when shopping
Gigabyte I can confirm was the absolute worst Asus in the past was more or less successful Nothing special but they took care of me Maybe they have gone downhill since the 10 series which is a damn shame
shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere
If things were the same as they were five or six years ago I would totally buy an AMD card but I am having trouble considering it these days because I like DLSS and some of the other products Nvidia offers Really hoping Team Red continues to improve their version because I have been a huge fanboy of their CPUs for years even during the FX
No it isn't you want reliable build quality you got EVGA and Sapphire if you fanboy or need nvidia products for other reasons that's on nvidia for literally shitting in loyal customers mouths year after year
I'm not sure if weight is much of a factor to consider with proper quilt cards but noise sure is
I've had multiple Gigabyte cards and they've been great each time
I'll probably go with MSI then when the time comes to upgrade
PNY is HQed in the US They're mainly an OEM
PNY Zotac Galax Inno3D Palit are all chinese and mainly operate in Europe and Asia Holy fuck dood PNY stands for Paris to New York and they're Headquartered in the US Ppl dont see many PNY because they focus on enterprise use cases Quadro cards for workstations or those unbranded cards you find in prebuilt Dell Alienware HP PCs
Don't know much about the topic but GN had a video a couple of years ago about some aspects of it
They're just generally shitty They even got caught red handed scalping their own 3080 90 cards at launch under a different name straight out of their warehouse directly onto ebay
MSI is great and their RMA process at least in Canada is one of the best I have a 3080 12gb gpu and its great
Wait what I own 3 laptops from them and the oldest being 5 years old and still running strong for games What happened
Theres a bunch of videos on GN s channel same as this one channel They do a lot of underhanded stuff
Too mamy reasons 1 caught scalping during the pandemic 2 Caught overvolting their cards 3 Software is actually bullshit especcially when it comes to updates for the mobo Oudated drivers most of the time 4 Tried bribing a youtuber to spin postive pr about their laptop
aorus is a bit of a weird one i'd set it at tier 1 5 of the 3 tiers of AiB cards doesnt quite match equally to FTW3 and Strix
Except Nvidia doesn't have an exclusive ecosystem to attract customers they have to compete with price to performance with AMD and soon Intel If they jack the prices too much like Apple it will become harder to recommend Nvidia when AMD Intel offer a similar product at a much better value
The problem is threefold They make money when the cards are current The issue is when they get to the end of a series Nvidia doesn't communicate well especially when it comes to pricing This prevents them from having proper logistics So when the new cards get here they have to sell their old stock at a discount to unload it This additional lose eats into whatever profit margins they made when the series was current Nvidia is undercutting them with the Founder's Edition because Nvidia pays for the VRAM and GPU at cost since they are the manufacturers Nvidia is setting the minimum and maximum MSRPs for the cards limiting EVGA's ability to fully recoup the cost of the their build quality and customer support practices Personally I tend to be willing to pay what I call the Apple Tax for a company with good build quality customer support and RMA practices and would likely still use EVGA if they were allowed to increase costs to make selling GPUs worth their while
He got better
Just one
dude could u imagine if evga picks up intel as an aib partner
MSI and what they pulled with Ebay
MSI gave me problems with a faulty 7870 where they kept trying to blame the PSU for failed posts New GPU fixed it
MSi is absolute trash Just watch almost any video on Gamersnexus from the past 5 years for MSi They try to bribe reviewers among other shit besides having just trash tier products They stopped being a good brand many years ago sadly
GALAX HOF Amazing cards
Is sapphire still kicking
Had an MSI 3080 Ventus die on me less than 24 hours after using on my pc sometime peak GPU shortage 2020 MSI flat out refused to do anything about it Had to return it to microcenter and then waited before stores open to get another GPU Ended up getting an MSI 3080 Gaming X Trio and that somewhat worked but constantly crashed due to memory junction overheating from them using garbage thermal pads Had to run the card on 100 fan just to use the card Ended up selling the card to a crypto miner and got an Asus Tuf 3090 OC to replace it which I had no problems with for the 8 months I had it
Eh I had excellent experience with Asus customer service The one time I had an issue they replaced it next day shipping immediately no questions asked
Looks like Zotacs hahahahahahahahahahaha
I've had 2 MSI laptops and an MSI mobo and I would absolutely not want an MSI GPU Their software is terrible and they can't be assed to actually try to localize their documentation instead using machine translate for everything
I have an msi 3080 ventus and a msi b550 carbon mobo Fairly pleased with both though had there not been a shortage and I had my way the gpu would ve been a FTW3 like my previous 1080ti was
As far as MSI goes view this then make your decision up on MSI being okay or not v O6BXwCJtaZE
Nope
Maybe the 30 series had issues but back when in 2017 when i upgraded and a bunch of my friends built their PC's we all had EVGA's and they're all going strong to this day
I haven't had EVGA cards but just from scrolling Reddit it seems to be countless good RMA stories but an order of magnitude of RMA's more than most other manufacturers in general I don't know how to take that info
Yeah recently got a 3080ti from evga made a post in their forums and got redirected by a tech into a person email chain to go through all the troubleshooting possible before moving to RMA Now I'm just hoping I'm not going to need the RMA and I can get the card working because yikes
as it should be
It s insane to me that Nvidia s CEO seemingly thinks their board partners add little value When people will only buy your product because your RMA process is that much better that alone is super valuable
EVGA's tech support as well is available 24 7 One of the most irritating things about tech support with other companies at least for where I live is the time zone difference and tech almost always has the issue of breaking at bumfuck o clock PM AM after you're ready to sit down and chill out for the weekend and you're shit outta luck until tomorrow The fact that I could call EVGA at ANY fucking time of the day and get a living breathing fluently English speaking person who will sit there and work things out with me over the phone made paying the extra premium for their products 100 worth it And like you said if you tell them the things you already tried they'll skip the script and save time I never felt like I was being treated like a number I didn't have that disconnect talking to them No other AIB matches their customer service and I'm willing to pay the extra 30 50 for the product to get that service
Seasonic is on par with EVGA imo but it's a bit easier to provide good PSU support because of lower volume product lower ASP and longer lifespans But among PSU manufacturers they occupy a similarly dominant position in my mind
I've bought MSI GPUs exclusively for the last 10 years never had a problem I've only used their top models though gaming lightning suprim
Gigabyte are scum af Gamers Nexus has a video on it and MSI products have always had problems for me so I guess would be neither imo Fingers crossed EVGA goes with AMD or Intel if they don t I m guessing I ll switch to team red for the next round of cards
No and no Fucking bullshit
They make good products but their tech support is absolute shit They have Western divisions but it's notw here their primary HQ is like EVGA's was
none
The issue with Gigabyte Aorus is their awful RMA Warranty support and its only been getting worse over the past 10 years Its at the point where I tell everyone interested in buying their products my RMA horror stories Between my own PC and family members PCs I've had 5 RMAs with their products and not a single time have I received a fully functioning product back from RMA In addition to that they had my motherboard in their RMA center for over 3 weeks then tried to claim that I damaged it I had photos that i took of the motherboard for shipping insurance purposes that show no damages When I sent those in a reply tot he email I was called a liar and they said I edited the photos to hide the damage I thought it was an isolated incident but I had a friend get his graphics card back from Gigabyte RMA with a giant gouge in the plastic shroud In addition to that I've read online about many other people who had their products sent into Gigabyte for RMA and after 3 or 4 weeks Gigabyte claims the product was damaged in the most unusual ways
I had a 970 from gigabyte g1 gaming and it was a solid graphic card Now I'm with a 3060Ti gaming OC and it serves me very well no faulty at all
Just a couple eh
Just stick to sapphire look up XFX cards too but Sapphire is in my world the best shot if you're doing an uninformed purchase
Unless you use NVENC or ray tracing a lot it's really not that bad I had a 5700 XT before my 3080 and my brother still has a 480 he's not the most ardent gamer lol but we're gonna try to get him something this generation no real issues with either AMD card though the 5700 XT just ran a bit hotter than a 3070 from what I could see from benchmarks
I'll share my experience going with 6800XT this gen from a RTX2070 Super due to shortage and have lots of mixed feelings It was a nightmare dealing with HEVC driver timeouts Having to reinstall driver over and over again because windows update looked at it wrong one way or the other VR is or was also a whole bunch of issues Have not tried the latest driver out of fear or just generally subpar video editing performance But It isn't all the time like that though and when it does happen you better be prepared for a bunch of head scratching and looking for solutions in the AMD subreddit But outside that I am very happy with every other aspect especially gaming performance Unless you care about RTX DLSS NVENC and other Nvidia goodies Which I do not miss one bit Ok I lied I only miss NVENC I've been screaming to go back Nvidia lately solely for video editing purposes But with the news that has been coming out and EVGA being the only AIB I would trust I think I'll stay AMD for the time being EDIT I also hope that the industry as a whole would stop relying on Nvidia propriety tech and use a more open approach but meh fat chance for it anytime soon
If all you do is gaming AMD is quite good Their next gen is supposed to be pretty great too Apparently part of why Nvidia is going Hog wild with power consumption next gen is because AMD has some really powerful stuff coming out in terms of generational improvements
No gigabyte MSI probably comes down to reputation and how they treat customers business partners they both make some high quality products
I love Sapphire and PowerColor but XFX I'm not as sure about that one
Yeah I used to like XFX when they did Nvidia but I've heard not great things about their practices I do like their MERC cards a lot stylistically I'll definitely be looking in that direction to see what's up
Zotac is great if u dont want something extreme my zotac came with 5 years warranty at EU i think the others gave like 3
Lol
I have been boycotting XFX ever since they stopped making Nvidia graphics cards I guess I will boycott eVGA too
I seen a couple of these videos and EVGA is getting out of GPUs entirely no AMD Nvidia or intel
Oh I like Asrock too For the price the Challenger D cards are far far better than MSI's Mech 2X or the Asus Dual and the Gigabyte equivalent
Better then Asus Gigabyte and MSI
Zotac usually cheaps out on internal components like capacitors and VRMs Could mean shorter lifespan or less stable OC than they otherwise should be able to do Of course a high end zotac will be better than the lowest end EVGA due to binning and cooling solutions but longevity and the performance they otherwise should be getting could be left on the table due to these shortcuts
They have real potential too if they fix up their software Actually in encoding they have an edge
Even worse than that 300 higher so x4 Meaning they make more margin on the 20 of revenue coming from PSU than on the 78 coming from all the GPU
I'm not going to avoid them or anything here on out but yeah if they're out of the GPU game they're not going to be on my mind as a company in general as much tbh
The positive EVGA PSU reputation can be helpful in jump starting their fledgling motherboard division whenever EVGA wants to continue with that route ASRock seemingly hasn't been doing well with providing quality motherboards since at least the release of B450 X470 from watching Hardware Unboxed and Buildzoid when I needed to upgrade to a newer motherboard A motherboard is one of the first if not the very first thing in my mind that connects to a PSU and have EVGA sell those two products as a pair like Micro Center's reoccurring 20 off promo for buying a CPU and motherboard together can be a strategically beneficial for EVGA
Good point though it won t affect people who already know them they ll still seek out EVGA s other products but it means newcomers to the PC space won t find them as easily I wonder though if they ll branch into other products like cases cooling etc And also increasing their peripherals business
I've had three RMAs with Asus and all of them were quick easy and painless
My farm stays on It's self sustaining with solar and 200kWh in storage made up of old Chevy Volt Battery sections that have been gifted or bought over the years It's still profitable at the moment and I'm looking forward to whatever the next coin project is Dogecoin set me up for life It was the best coin I've ever mined and held onto This whole GPU mining is dead has all happened before several times
The one thing different is that BFG didn't have the choice in being dropped Nvidia wanted to slimline their AIB's and AMD didn't want to add another partner at the time But BFG was still doing ok But as soon as they didn't have GPUs to sell Best Buy dropped their PSU lineup That is what killed BFG EVGA might have the money for this But I doubt they are ready for how much an after thought any computer electronics sources are going to treat them when they aren't a major source for their GPUs Unlike BFG online sales were much smaller and places like Newegg carried a lot less products So their sales won't completely dry up But they will just be another random PSU
Did they replace them for you
I do know that their product quality is on par with EVGA However going with Sapphire won't solve the problem for people wanting the best RTX gpus
Well except the AMD part
I mean Nvenc and Cuda cores are very useful for a lot of people I went with Nvidia because I needed Nvenc
What the fuck is Kingpin gonna do Lmfao
WWWWWWWHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Holy shit
I actually got to meet the architect for the cell processor during a lecture He actually brought up that during initial design discussions they considered CUDA but NVIDIA was being too restrictive with the technology As for the Cell processor he mentioned it got praise for how well it exposed accelerators but was also criticized for how much knowledge it took to take it on As for the performance of the Cell processor he said he still doesn t fully understand why it didn t perform as much as they hoped It s performance was comparable to the power processor IBM already had
This is true but what's even more high end is VR and ray tracing is all but a pipe dream there And DLSS is useless there as well I only have a high end card because of VR Regular gaming is mostly dead to me
Hmm now do you think that's because a 200 billion dollar company doesn't know how or it's out of respect for the partners Somehow it sells millions of datacenter GPUs around the world every year without partners just fine
There are always two sides to every story and it is really trendy to hate on Nvidia also to hate on intel and to fanboi AMD I'm just an end consumer I'll never know the full story I just buy whatever products are good and meet my needs at the time Trusting a company even respecting them seems fine to me if they have earned it Being loyal to a company is weird People making their loyalty to a company an actual part of their identity is not healthy I'm expecting to buy a nvidia card in the next couple of months I don't know if I will pair it with the new AMD or intel CPUs though I suspect that most people are similar they buy what is right for them The rabid fanbois who have incorporated a corporate brand as part of their personality might not but I hope they are in the minority
Thanks for confirming that
Cool My R9 Fury is really showing its 4GB age If I stick with AMD next upgrade I'm going back to Sapphire again
Beyond terrible it's an inexcusable position to put your partners in If all of this is true then nVidia is basically acting like who gives a shit about partners so long as we get ours In fact the GN video mentioned that Jensen had commented in the past something to the effect of why should they get to make so much money off of the cards they aren't doing most of the work It sounds like nVidia just doesn't believe that the AIB vendors are adding any value and are merely a mechanism to help them scale out board production
Covered in post
First of all in April demand was dropping eg this is when 30 series became available 't when EVGA alerted Nvidia see pinned comment to video with correction EVGA alerted Nvidia in June This is well into it
If you want to believe money doesn't talk There is an absurd amount of money on the table Crypto had a huge influence over the boom over the last couple years which can be seen by the flood gates of GPUs that are now going back to market Nvidia got sued because they didn't even understand the implications of crypto on their sales
Good call out Edited for posterity
Damn With profit margins THAT razor thin im surprised they didn't dump nvidia earlier
People can change their mind Intel or AMD could show up at Andrews office next year and make a sweetheart deal It's his choice at that point in the future to say yes or no
That's what I'm wondering too I have an EVGA 3090 FTW3 card that's still under warranty for several more years and I literally just purchased another EVGA 3090 FTW3 for my dad's birthday last week We always purchase EVGA cards due to their warranty customer service and their HQ being located in the US So yea what happens if one of our card's malfunctions 2 and a half years from now
Lmao no Nvidia will stay the leading vendor for any high performance systems from consumer graphics cards to edge computing to datacenter machine learning solutions in the foreseeable future there's nobody who could possibly compete with them Like the best answer to CUDA AMD could come up with is a frickin translation layer so you can run CUDA code on AMD hardware and Intel isn't even trying
They probably already get a massive amount Remember they do the gpu s for all 3 consoles
GN did mention later in the video that EVGA's position in the industry makes them dream partners to be courted by Intel or AMD right now They're arguably top in the game for AIB partners and AMD or Intel could court EVGA to give them a much more favorable partnership than NVIDIA has
True I d know for a fact some gn fan has been stalking me thru 2 different sites Even got Steve to reply to my complaint But still bigger issue is the stalking part
Yeah we definitely lost a legend However I'm still optimistic that they'll continue to innovate in their other offerings
crazy imagine you lose your job while working for the most respected market leader because the CEO has a personal grudge Dude just retire or sell
AFAIK Powercolor is generally good but they occasionally have missteps
I bought a 5700xt from that I had to rma a year later They did it instantly The replacement is still going strong Just my my experience though
They've improved quality significantly from the RX 5000 series onwards I now recommend them
I was buying current card almost exactly 12months ago meaning when the prices were the worst and I'm from central EU where prices always are worse in general than anywhere in the western direction so I was buying whatever I found deal without hefty premium scalp Initially I planned to get nvidia this gen but RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti were 200 300 respectively more expensive on average compared to RX 6600 XT which was completely unreasonable sum to pay extra over already inflated prices of AMD cards
Mine was pegged at 110 on an evga card mining for over a year and is fine
the 3070 don't suffer the same as 3080 and above does The ti is even hotter than the 3080 however
They're talking about the future so who knows Steam's OS is gaining some moment with the steam deck and maybe some handheld PCs Microsoft is doing what they are doing the for the past 20 years Apple is increasingly closing off its ecosystem Linux could be the future Though I think if Linux becomes the future nvidia wouldn't have too much of a hard time catching up
These days Many of them do But there are still plenty of hurdles to Linux gaming in general for sure but better than it has ever been
Yeah AMD have really turns their CPUs around in recent years I even ended up getting a 5950X as I was sold on the raw horsepower although I'm not sure why but at times I've just found it to not be that efficient at running some very simple tasks which should be a piece of cake for a CPU of its calibre though I'm not sure if that's an issue with Windows not being as optimised for it
I've had a 100 success rate with Gigabyte GPUs 2 cards 3070 and 3080ti Good mem temps and everything as advertised Haven't had to RMA either which I hear is where the trouble begins But store warranty is just as long anyway
With the RTX 3000 series you can often flash the Suprim BIOS to the Gaming X Trio of the same CPU Also my Gaming X Trio 3090 is some sort of silicon lottery winner and hits 2 3 GHz GPU clock speed with chilled water cooling
Asus pays the cashback not the middle man Also a fraud will get you into a trouble
So basically what you are saying here is you should not pay extra for more fps quality components and silence Does PC have to sound like a tornado Main reason why i bought 2 of these was because they are so silent and one of the best 3070's made After bursting that kind of nonsense i'd include you in that bunch
You are proving my point Asus gigabyte Imo how they react after something like this pops up is really important You could also add here NZXT and how they reacted to their case fire hazard I would not say Asus is bottom tier Yes their customer support is really bad but thats why you have to avoid doing it yourself Leave it to the shop where you bought it and do not fall to the gimmicks and cashbacks
I know thats why im warning people
Also remember when their subsidiary got caught scalping their own gpus on eBay
I dunno I jury rigged a second rig and put their 6600 xt in it Turns out it's the best one available apart from price
I bought an MSI GPU years ago and it was DOA they sent me a refurb to replace it I'm like if I wanted a refurb I would've saved the 30 and bought fucking refurb I want NiB damnit
MSI has plenty of excellent cards as well All the AIBs have some mediocre cards
How so I bought an MSI 3090 Ti SUPRIM X a couple weeks ago lol
MSI and Gigabytes are not horrible
Accurate Their Ventus series is so cheap made compared to EVGA but asked for much more
Welp EVGA and ASRock are the only two companies I ever really had any good customer service with in the tech industry RIP
Except those RTX 3090 FTW3 cards with the black screen and 100 fan issue that would eventually stop working Some of the had the red light of death After getting three of those EVGA refunded my purchase price and paid me back for my shipping costs for the RMAs
I think you must be confusing the TUF series of cards with the Dual series as TUF is certainly their mid range and while not strix tier is still pretty good Stay away from Dual
Now i'm curious Why
i guess someone does't like it when their lovely brand gets exposed to be horrible
Asus has solid build quality no Their video cards have always been good Their motherboard firmware is the best in the business That said their customer service is nonexistent
Really you think that s the only difference between the driver packages
Killshot is Eminem's diss back to MGK I totally forgot about that beef
Yuuup all so they could get around their contract limitations of price margins Sold to themselves and then sold for double or more on ebay
Okay thank you Just for the record I ve never owned an MSI product I m more of an ASUS guy
In Europe it's horrible
It's not so much the quality of the products hell I'm running a 6 year old MSI 1080 that is still healthy as far as I can tell It's their strong arming of reviewers to stop them from giving out negative reviews like threatening to withhold review samples from people if they publish anything negative or promising to let reviewers keep future review samples for free if they get a good enough review etc That and their price gouging when they got caught selling their own cards under one of their partner's names intended to sell old excess stock but instead were selling launch day 3080s and 3090s for twice their MSRP on eBay
She turned me into a newt
Lol I think they re just flat out done for good or a long time at least but yes that would be mega strange
Tbf assuming msi is getting disrespected by nvidia as badly as EVGA is claiming of themselves then the eBay thing is a logical albeit unfortunate consequence
That was a small sub group who took advantage of company resources and redirected them to E bay
Even for other stuff Bought a MSI laptop 2 years ago and it's the crappiest plastic laptop build I've ever had Would even go back to Lenovo in a heartbeat Already had to glue the plastic that attaches to the hinges on both sides
The only MSI I am using is their Afterburner software which I find very good Other than that I think I would go with Asus despite being not perfect either
The thing that has surprised me in this saga is how much some people hate MSI especially in comparison to Asus Basically everyone has said well guess I'll settle for Asus next gen when they are at least as bad as MSI
I question if MSI was ever a good brand They re like a shitty knockoff version of Asus Asus makes good shit but has awful customer service My Gigabyte gear has been good There s a few other good companies out there
I didnt know this I always loved my MSI 2080ti Trio X even though it was marked up over the competition when I bought it Still my primary card til I can get a 4090 or something
I haven't done my research but I believe sapphire is still alright same with powercolor especially with their red devil cards
I personally have never dealt with MSI so I can't say for or against them but I can say asus is a b tch times three to deal with an RMA G safe to say I'm not buying a card from a company known to gaslight reviewers after their own horrible design blows up in people's computers
Zotac blatantly supported mining so idk lol
if two products within the market are so functionally identical that the only thing that can distinguish them is when they break then I think you ve accidentally made a great case for just now little value board partners add to a design nowadays Contrast that to the distinctions between brands and products 10 years ago which were massive at a physical level Remember the Asus mars series or powercolor 290x2 Intense binning double vram all kinds of crazy designs Granted most of that stopped because GPU boost took the binning out of binning and NVIDIA tightened way down on what partners would be allowed to do but yeah today partners don t really add value in any meaningful way Having to point to something like rma is because of the lack of other meaningful value adds
I've bought 2 Motherboards and a 34 3440x1440 curved widescreen from MSI No issues at all However all my GPUS have been EVGAs So I'll just buy a 40 series GPU from MSI based off my history with them Sad to see EVGA drop out of the GPU business pensive face
My current desktop with a 3770k and server with a 4570k both with MSI boards going on 10 years service both are still running great Gaming rig has gone through 2 card upgrades at this point originally a EVGA 780 then EVGA 970 now a MSI 1080 It's been about 5 6 years on the 1080 and it's still going
same here
I have a ventus 3080 rn and besides being loud af it's pretty good
if you go amd sapphire is pretty comparable to evga in terms of not being bastards
I mean we dont have much choice was my point
MSI Can eat shit I am sorry I had a motherboard 3 years ago that cooked my SSD and the board EVGA Power Supply survived That's the same power supply I am still using to this day Micro Center tech said there was a capacitor that burnt out for the mb Plus Gigabitch can eat two dicks Have you ever got stuck on Backuping Bios Boot Loop by just turning the PC on I had two different boards that did that garbage to me x200B I have an Asus Tuf it's okay I had a bunch of driver issues a lot of Black screens of death Idk why I installed that bloatware that there call a utility app to monitor I finally uninstalled it by finding an uninstall tool from google drive on Reddit because the one on the ASUS Website is wrong My board works fine now x200B I am just going to miss EVGA
Interesting I never had an issue with Gigabyte boards I even bought a pre owned one which still works I bought a MSI product couple of times and they broke on me so stopped buying theirs I think it's just our personal experience with the products and nothing to do with QC However that means I never had to deal with their RMA Warranty department which I agree with you could be awful My comment is only in the sense that since he said Asus can't be trusted we don't have much choice It's more of a rhetorical question really Like between ASUS MSI and Gigabyte who is better
XFX cards are my favorite for AMD Their 6000 series designs hit it out of the ballpark
I went AMD for a while with an RX580 Vega56 Radeon 7 and 5700XT in rapid succession Still have the RX580 which is still a great card Their drivers are much better than they used to be but I think the stigma is still there from when they were trash The 5700XT was replaced by a 3090FE which I m happy with Next gen Nvidia isn t looking amazing to me I m going to look keenly at AMD 7000 series
High quality products low quality support and customer service
Most GPU makers make quality products it's more about the ratio of quality to crap Can't speak on MSI but Gigabyte cards and PSUs are littered with problems pretty frequently
Gigabyte and high quality do not belong in the same sentence since like the last 5 years
XFX was the absolute best at one point They used to have a lifetime warranty on their GPUs but went down to I think 5 years Still good AFAIK
XFX recent cards are awesome so maybe it's recency bias on my part
sounds like a fanboy to me
For now I hope they come back in the future Intel especially could use their know how right now
Those make cards for both though I'm talking about the exclusive partners
Any proof of this This whole thread seems to just be useless anecdotes and source my arse
Yeah good point
If only for the reason they might go out of business in a few years with this decision
really are you sure
Yes but Sapphire RMA is slow in my country
Sapphire does not occasionally use PCPartner Sapphire cards are made by PCPartner Though Sapphire the company is independent from PCPartner
I would put Sapphire even above EVGA at least from a design standpoint of the gpus The Nitro cards are incredible at cooling while also usually being one of the most silent cards while also being reasonably priced People liked EVGA for other reasons than just design philosophy though Not that it matters anyway since they didnt really compete against each other Funnily enough EVGA has a very low market share here in Germany because they are on an exclusive deal with who btw stopped selling Asus a few years ago due to being a shitty partner I did own a EVGA 1070 Ti because it was an insanely good discount deal on caseking once one of the better cards that I owned
What's wrong with AMD GPUs I've used both they're great Especially RSR is something I've had great use of that Nvidia lacks and their power efficiency is better
He'll probably go back to messing with Spider Man
It's not speculation Steve said the CEO literally told him they're exiting the GPU business entirely so either the CEO lied to Steve or it's actually happening
Is that enough for you then
GN is pretty fuckin reliable
I'm not saying this news sounds like something that happens every day but there have been many cases where a massive corporation one day suddenly stops doing the one thing they were known for and starts doing something else It is costly but it happens Nintendo started out as a playing card company Xerox used to make paper LG was a cosmetics company Hell The Gap was originally a record store that also sold jeans
They're probably finding peripherals to have better profitability with way less cost up front
Probably lost a ton of money on 3000 series and have no choice but to bail
That's a good point I have an Oculus Rift CV1 and I don't use it as much as I'd like to since I have to wear contact lenses every time I want to play it's a bit of a hassle to wear them just for that And the screen quality isn't that great I'd love to get more into VR but I don't see the tech evolving that much Foveated rendering eye tracking should be the main focus IMO but as far as I know it's not there yet Those two things a super high resolution and a big FOV I always disliked the snorkel mask FOV and I'd happily spend wayyyy more money than I should on that
Business to business transactions are so different from the consumer market
out of respect for the partners I mean this whole video is about Nvidia having zero respect for its AIBs If they could ditch AIBs and sell direct they would ASUS MSI Gigabyte etc are established in almost every country on earth they either have subsidiaries or local partners to handle imports logistics transportation marketing sales RMAs tech support etc Nvidia doesn't
If Nvidia AMD were able to sell all the mid range high end cards they could produce prior to crypto they'll certainly be able to sell all their mid range high end cards after the collapse of crypto The only people who think crypto really matters are other crypto people
I mean even at 2 margin if your volume is high you can make money The problem is that a 2 margin on a thousand dollar product means you're extending yourself to huge financial risk if those products don't sell through and you can't decide on that for example if your supplier announces a new generation right after suddenly flooding the market with 30 series It's a repeating cycle that happened during Turing too Effectively EVGA and other AIBs are the ones taking all the financial risk off Nvidia's shoulders in exchange for a 2 cut I guess they just got tired of it especially when they get treated so badly by Nvidia Nvidia believes AIBs add nothing to the product and treats them the same as customers telling them the price of chips on the day of the launch
Lisa Su can make an offer he can't refuse lol
Sure anythings technically possible
I'm personally skeptical Allegedly the motivation is principle and personal life not money So unless its a really good deal I don't think they will be swayed If they were even open to that they wouldn't have be so open about leaving the GPU industry alltogether Stating explicitly they aren't working with AMD or Intel and burning the Nvidia bridge Think about it this way They have some 250ish employees iirc who have been told that the company is downsizing and a large chunk of their jobs will soon be obsolete Even if EVGA intend to keep their promise of not laying people off highly skilled employees are going to be jumping ship sooner rather than later So AMD and Intel need to make the offer EVGA can't refuse in a relatively short timeframe because otherwise there won't be enough left of EVGA to salvage GPU wise
Sure if they want to pivot to enterprise and prosumer only But that isn't the apple model Which is supposedly what they want to emulate There's no way Nvidia has success only releasing founders cards and cutting AIBs out with the enthusiast consumers they want to continue to engage
They make the whole SoC for the home consoles nothing for Switch But that allocation is for the consoles which themselves are still starving for more allocation at least based on the availability
Except the time to negotiate with AMD or Intel was BEFORE dropping Nvidia Now AMD and Intel know they're in a bad financial situation and have nothing to fall back on It's why you get better job offers when you're currently employed vs when you're unemployed
That's insanity Some people just cannot stand to be questioned or the things they like believe it's the mark of extremism and should be criticized at every opportunity Having said that a good suggestion I have for you with regards to online spaces is to create different usernames aliases There was a time when everyone was cautioned to not use their real names online but the age of social media has ground that good advice into dust But the truth of it still remains you're much easier to track and follow when you use the same accounts and names across different things In a perfect world we'd just have discussions arguments and leave it at that but alas the world isn't perfect and some people take things way too far Just a piece of advice
It's not all personal There's a very real trend of decreasing margins for AIB partners over the years
Oddly enough I have the exact one in your flair
Yet it was easily fixed with better thermal pads and improved the overall temp inside my case I'd just do it for the increased headroom and hopefully the card will last longer too
And you are saying below 80 wouldn't be better Also one year is the benchmark to beat
True if we look back far enough it could happen but as you say nVidia wouldn't have trouble catching up in that case
the 5600 5800 5900 after price drop were more sensible but 5800x3d is the real gamechanger This gen was good but the prices were just high enough to prevent upgrading from a to improve my 1 lows Huge lift but it appears the most struggling games need a huge cache to run smooth at all This makes intels offerings seem like jokes I bought a 50 msi b450m to put my old 3600 in and put the 5600 in le ole msi b450 cost about 75 Beat that value could help Though the top CPU's aren't really made for efficiency
The problem is the windforce cards
It's not difficult to make a passably quiet 3070 because of the low tdp High end SKUs are only necessary or barely justifiable for very high wattage cards
Yep Asus strix cards are some of the best performing cards you can buy but their low end models have god awful coolers This is honestly true of most electronics manufacturers For instance Dell XPS laptops are great but some of their budget models are a nightmare
Their customer support supposedly isn't great I've never had to contact them myself so I'm just parroting the general narrative I've owned 3 MSI cards and they've been fast quiet and reliable
Time to update your flair then
Yep AsRock are pretty solid when it comes to customer service Which is weird since it's a spin off from Asus
The issue with Gigabyte Aorus is their awful RMA Warranty support and its only been getting worse over the past 10 years Its at the point where I tell everyone interested in buying their products my RMA horror stories Between my own PC and family members PCs I've had 5 RMAs with their products and not a single time have I received a fully functioning product back from RMA In addition to that they had my motherboard in their RMA center for over 3 weeks then tried to claim that I damaged it I had photos that i took of the motherboard for shipping insurance purposes that show no damages When I sent those in a reply tot he email I was called a liar and they said I edited the photos to hide the damage I thought it was an isolated incident but I had a friend get his graphics card back from Gigabyte RMA with a giant gouge in the plastic shroud In addition to that I've read online about many other people who had their products sent into Gigabyte for RMA and after 3 or 4 weeks Gigabyte claims the product was damaged in the most unusual ways
you posted a novel not reading all of that you look like a psychotic x200B and asus is far from my preferred brand theyre the joe biden of pc hardware at least its not insert any other runner up
They are solidly built you pay the ASUS tax though
I just found out Asus cheaped out on my 1080ti strix with no thermal pads on the memory phase I would have gotten Evga next time around but now I don t know what to buy really
Not on AMD thats for sure And cheap gpu versions from ASUS are not that good
Well Nvidia drivers suck on Linux while AMD drivers don't
Oh ok TIL thanks
ASUS is definitely a step above msi and gb
Their motherboards have served me well and I like their bios over comparably priced competitors Can't say much about the company though since I haven't had to RMA but I like their boards Between them and ASUS if I had to choose Seen too many dead Gigabytes
Gigabyte has the worst shit in gpus and motherboards msi is much better than them and asus is the best of them all I wonder how can someone put giga above msi lmao
Yeah there s not much options left I might end up going with a PNY or Palit card
I was more kidding than anything
You re acting as if cooling Nvidia s absurdly power hungry chips is also easy Also RMA is costly especially good ones like EVGA s Do you think Nvidia would be keen to absorb the cost of a good RMA program if they had no board partners Hell no they d probably be worse than even their current mediocre partners
As a general rule of thumb I also avoid the first batch of anything the memory thermal pad problem affected a lot of AIBs not just MSI like some people say My 3080 12gb gaming trio mems hover around 70c 75c at max load
Did you undervolt it I'm 100 sure you will get more performance doing it since you won't be hitting the power limit so hard And it will run cooler too
That's not how it works motherboard doesn't create any additional voltages for SSD all necessary voltages come from PSU A bad capacitor would short to ground and just kill your motherboard nothing else It's more probable that your SSD killed that capacitor with some weird EMI noise you should have RMA'd your SSD
In addition to my own PCs and PCs for friends and family members I've been running a side business where I build custom PCs for over a decade Gigabyte Aorus is the only company that I've consistently had issues with their RMA warranty service I've probably dealt with a lot more warranty RMA issues than the average PC builder user who does a new PC or upgrade every few years PC components usually either die in the first few months or they last a long time Its not unusual to put a build together and everything initially works fine however after the 30 day vendor's return window something dies I'm not saying it happens often but it does happen That's when you are stuck dealing with the manufacturer's warranty RMA service Personally I'd say of the three Asus is the best of the three for warranty RMA service especially in the past 3 years
Double lifetime You could transfer the warranty after selling the card
They are the leader when it comes to tits ass themed product naming
I used to use ATI graphics exclusively but I had too many hardware failures and driver issues I went with Nvidia and my problems went away Until I got the steam deck I had avoided ATI graphics for years I have no plans to give business to AIBs not willing to sell Nvidia hardware By the way the first eVGA graphics card I ever brought caught fire when I tried booting my machine with it eVGA replaced it under warranty but I can say no one else has ever sold me a part that lit on fire the moment it was powered It is probably more a surprise that I did not boycott them sooner
You see it time and time again on PCB teardowns on their GPUs For example the Zotac 3080 Trinity was basically the worst 3080 PCB wise that you could buy lots of corners cut on components Zotac is kind of lucky I'm doing their teardown first because from what I've seen so far this is probably one of the most down costed RTX 3080 PCB their their power stages aren't any better than what other cards are using and they seem to be cutting down on the total number of output filter capacitors Buildzoid v 0AVZSjYDR2E This is the common theme with Zotac This says nothing about their thermal designs of which I've heard bad things on a few cards but it says a lot about how stable their GPUs will be with overclocks undervolting and how long the cards may last
Yes I'm 100 sure I explained my problem to support After explaining my issue and my troubleshooting steps I was told they were issuing a RMA Asus offered me discounted UPS shipping for the RMA Within 3 5 business days of Asus receiving my RMA item they had a replacement shipped out to me
My Nitro Vega 64 is incredible Very high wattage but never is audible or gets above 70
Drivers still suck in comparison Definitely not giving up DLSS or not having to constantly experience ATI driver bugs dating back 15 years ago when I play games
I need CUDA support And rocm is a joke
Or they realize they are dumb for trying to do that and change their
Companies can change their mind whenever they wish to
That also sold Levi Strauss and Co J
Maybe but they are going to come to the harsh realization that without people coming to them for GPUs nobody is going to pay any attention at all to their average at best peripherals
Well the PSVR2 coming early next year has Foveated rendering eye tracking and finger tracking with 4K
I guess nvidia is uniquely stupid can't figure out that damnable selling to consumers thing that millions of other companies do
nvidia is cutting out AIBs very slowly if at all I think it's a significant amount of respect shown that AIBs are even a thing at all since in the vast majority of industries they don't exist It's quite a uniquely bizarre thing in GPUs you ever bought an MSI PS5 or EVGA iPod Or even a Sapphire Ryzen Or an Asus ShieldTV Intel doesn't have any AIBs at all so the idea that steve and jay were begging EVGA to go to Intel is so funny Why would Intel want to share their profits if they had any lol with some rando company in the first place
Supply and demand dude Basic level stuff Crypto boom created a unprecedented demand for cards and AMD Nvidia ramped up production to meet that's why they had record breaking quarters I'm not spot on but pretty sure those crypto miners aren't going to set fire to their cards instead of selling them
Evga AMD boards exist So maybe more focus on motherboards
Have you seen oneAPI It looks like a very solid first effort to me Fair I heard the name but probably filtered it out because Intel lacks the hardware to be even considered right now
Nvidia does not want to be anything like Apple They thrive on partners ecosystems and run away from building anything too commodity
Yes but essentially closing down your company over something questionable like respect is very hotheaded Where is the respect for the employees who gave us those amazing cards and service Where is the respect for customers who value the brands quality The company is literally namev E VGA What are they going to call themself in the future ExVGA If the CEO wants to spend more time with his family instead of Nvidia thats fair but dont drag the company with you Just step down They dont even consider switching to a different partner thats crazy
Yep I've been mining too I get shit hashrate thanks to vram thermal throttle and the vram simply isn't meant to bounce off of 110 constantly who the fuck thinks that's good design And 1 year is absolutely nothing I don't see how anyone can draw that conclusion from just one year of operation This card also manages to stress my 1050 watt PSU already with its 300 watts it's working harder than it did when I crossfired 2x250 watts of 7970s
if the steam deck takes off to become a recurring thing a la console releases you bet amd's long time linux support and their integrated gpu designs will certainly have a good head start Consoles are already amd but imagine if a linux based console is released It'll be AMD too I don't think desktop linux gaming will be anywhere near big in the next ten years nvidia may improve their support but it's not like it'll sell desktop cards in the way steam deck already sells tiny rdna2 chips Feels more like a we turned the thing on have fun situation
And eagle series They are crap
Why's that
I gamed on a windforce GTX 1080 for years with overclock and it worked properly and never died It's just chilling in a backup PC now I guess things may have went downhill after Pascal
Even the MSI high end cards are pretty good Their gaming X models are on par with EVGA FTW and Strix
Considering it was annoying at best to register my 3090Ti on their site i dont expect it to be smooth sailing if warranty work is needed But that all depends on if i ever need to execute said warranty
Trueeeeee
This is very simplistic and is totally changing with the 30 series and up moving almost all of the old driver into firmware with a new open source kernel module to assist
You re acting as if cooling Nvidia s absurdly power hungry chips is also easy umm it is pretty easy when you don't have partners setting 50 TDP configurations the 3080 FE is a 2 slot cooler and it's fine cooling a 320W board 3090 FE cooler what 2 75 slot They make by far the smallest coolers on the market and they run just fine It's the partners who do the insane 450W on 3090 shit for the most part that got me thinking about 3090 Ti FE and you know 's actually not all that bad A couple degrees hotter than EVGA FTW3 3090 Ti but a couple dB quieter so about half the noise which really isn't bad for a compact cooler design like that
I did but its still kinda loud yet again all of my GPUs before this didn't have 3 fans
Oh that makes sense Well shit I think Microcenter just gave me a replacement SSD Don't remember But it sucks that EVGA is done What brand for graphic cards do you recommend from your experience
I used to live outside US and Asus used to be priced even more ridiculous than other brands Now that I live in US I was actually planning to get Asus stuff next time Now that EVGA is gone for graphics cards I guess we don't have much of a choice Perhaps EVGA will continue making motherboards however I am not sure if this BIOS is better then Asus
True lol I care more about the product tho
damn wtf
That's really great to hear Hopefully they fixed the way they process RMAs now and this is the new standard procedure It used to be such a hassle to work with ASUS support staff
FSR 2 0 is just as good as DLSS and is coming in more new games and drivers definitely don't suck that was true 2 years ago but not now they're equally as good as Nvidias drivers at this point
That's fair but AMD ROCm and CUDA is definitely not something the average consumer is going to care about
Yeah that's roughly 80 of their revenue they're just kissing goodbye There's absolutely no fucking chance they can make that work At best they'd have to decimate their staff and operate with a skeleton crew Thereby ensuring their product and CS quality plummet until nobody will buy anything at all from them I give it six months before they realize they're dead in the water with this plan and announce a partnership with AMD
Agreed Their other products aren't appealing in comparison with competitors like Corsair and Logitech Now they'll just be selling mediocre mice and keyboards and overpriced motherboards Yikes Unless they have some plan with AMD under a NDA agreement this is unfortunately probably the beginning of the end for EVGA That sucks because they're my GPU brand of choice and I've used them for almost 10 years now
They probably just don t have enough money to do GPUs again Probably got rekt by Nvidia raising the prices on chips and now they re stuck with unprofitable boards they have to sell at a loss
Their mice were sellign like hotcakes
Such a closed ecosystem though
No it just costs a shit ton of money and upfront costs to set distribution up thats why partners exist they have already set that up
There is no respect involved Nvidia needs AIBs at least for the foreseeable future as much as they need Nvidia You're saying Nvidia is doing charity work how does that make sense Nvidia would ditch AIBs yesterday if they could but it would be an expensive endeavour They and AMD might have lost money to AIBs in the long term but they sure as hell saved a lot of money in the short term money that was probably better spent on more immediate stuff like R D Like I said Asus etc already has the infrastructure to move and service products in 200 countries it would be very unwise for Nvidia to not keep utilizing that at least for now and spend billions and billions to open up warehouses offices etc in every single country on earth PC market is small enough that they would need to sell more than GPUs to sustain all that spending like how AIBs sell monitors motherboards power supplies laptops peripherals etc Intel doesn't have any AIBs Unsurprisingly it does for its discreet gpus CPUs don't need AIBs they're easy to package transport and sell and they almost never break so they don't need real aftersale support In most countries distributors or sellers handle warranty claims because failure rate is incredibly small compared to GPUs Even then Intel relies heavily on OEMs like Dell or HP to market and sell CPUs in server space laptops and prebuilts where most of their money comes from So they don't really have what it takes to sell GPUs worldwide either I'm sure they're trying their hardest to convince big manufacturers to take up their GPUs
Intel doesn't have any AIBs at all so the idea that steve and jay were begging EVGA to go to Intel is so funny Intel has plenty of partners because quite a few of their products aren't sold directly to consumers GPU's chipsets and laptop systems for starters
Intel doesn't have any AIBs at all They absolutely do They partnered with several GPU manufacturers for their dedicated GPUs for exactly the same reason AMD and Nvidia have partners They don't sell them directly at all
Perhaps you should watch the video
Where is the respect for the employees who gave us those amazing cards and service Where is the respect for customers who value the brands quality Those are probably as much questions for Nvidia as much as they are for EVGA's CEO With ever thinning margins how are they expected to continue without some form of relief They dont even consider switching to a different partner thats crazy idk why they didn't consider AMD That one might be a personal thing on the CEO's part We'll see if they change their mind after cooling off for a few months
The build quality is miles worse than the gaming oc c and they even say it's normal
I guess 's Turing windforce overheating issue and found some people tearing down 1080's windforce saying the cooling solution isn't enough to cool the chip about how thick the heatsink is etc 't know if it's an issue exclusive to hardware from my country Brazil or it's climate but I did find complaints so I don't know
I have a MSI GF65 i5 rtc2060 and bought it at a very good price two years ago It doesn't have the best build quality but haven't had a problem with it It runs like a champ any game I want and nothing to complain about when I see 1400 1600 usd laptops Of course they are better but for my buck I'm happy
I'd still pass idk why but when I see MSI name I feel like I have to wash my hands
Have a 6800 XT Gaming X Trio and I couldn't be happier when it comes to AMD It works excellent
Lol I thought about doing the same Like who doesn t want the 3090 ti big dick hat
Its loud doing what exactly My 3080 sits at 62c 50 fan on port royale
Hard to tell I have never RMA'd any computer part so far I always look for card review especially cooling solution before purchase My current 2080 from MSI works flawlessly since RTX 20 release and afterburner is a great tool not only for MSI cards though my next one will probably be MSI again or FE if I get a chance to purchase one here in europe Also could consider Zotac since they have pretty good designs now
That's been my experience with Asus RMAs for a few years now I guess it has been fixed
No its not and that's what people told me a couple years ago when I had my r7 370 and rx480 the drivers still suck and it was intensely liberating to switch to Nvidia and have things just work for once EVGA leaving is not even remotely a good enough reason to deal with that bs again
Agreed for the most part though cuda is used by CAD and rendering software too For me It's just nice to have the standard for GPGPU compute probably even if I didn't depend on cuda for my workflow But I guess that's just my ptsd from trying to run GPGPU on opencl a few years back when I used to only buy amd cards
Reddit yet again fails to differentiate between revenue and profit
PSUs which they were making 300 the margin on vs GPUs and makes up 20 of their revenue
Yea 100 this Nvidia makes way more profit than evga Add in higher up front cost warranty efforts shipping etc w
nvidia needed AIBs when they were a garage outfit worth a couple of million of dollars so they can concentrate on design Now they're worth 200 billion have dozens of products and the only reason why AIBs are still a thing is respect Like I said Asus etc already has the infrastructure to move and service products in 200 countries it would be very unwise for Nvidia to not keep utilizing that at least for now and spend billions and billions to open up warehouses offices etc in every single country on earth You clearly have no idea what you're talking about
I did And my statement holds as correct
Yes eagle
Yeah I don't know about that My card would see around 83C on a hot day here during gaming sessions with overclock and raised power limits as far as afterburner lets me slide it so it seems the design is good enough to cool the card My case isn't super airflow friendly either I'm sure it'snot the best 1080 out there like core temps and memory temps and noise could be better but it's still a working 1080 after all Hope they don't screw up we need more AIBs NVidia founders edition cards always run hotter than even basic AIB cards
I hope you wiped the drive and got rid of all the bloatware Not that they are the only ones you should have seen the filth that came on the Dell laptop i bought
Lol msi was never any lower than evga to begin with msi literally pissing on Asus motherboards and soon Asus will be people's second choice after MSI
It's irrational to have a strong aversion or affinity to any brand I don't particularly care for MSI more or less than any other But the reviews are clear that they can and do make some good products just like the rest
Well considering I bought it 2 weeks ago the inflated pricing it once was isn t big fuck energy lol
Even if people told you that then that doesn't suddenly make them bad now they've been getting a lot better after 5000 series launch and very polished after 6000 series launch I can completely understand your viewpoint if you've had that experience but don't just completely disregard that they've gotten a lot better because of that you haven't exactly tried any of their new 6000 series GPUs
Lol no you're not special just because you understand the definition of elementary level economic terms Here in reality companies need revenue to stay afloat They may not have been getting insane margins on their GPUs but they were absolutely turning a profit Now they have nothing of note to offer and will be forgotten by about 99 of PC builders
Right but a 300 margin on a 100 PSU which people only tend to buy every 5 years isn't going to cut it for them as opposed to a 1000 GPU people are more compelled to buy every 2 3 years
You clearly have no idea what you're talking about I think you just have bad reading comprehension In any case please enlighten me How would Nvidia take up the mantle from the AIBs overnight like you're implying How would they make orders of magnitude more GPUs and export them that they can't even manufacture mind you they literally rely on PNY Foxconn etc to manufacture their FE and Quadro cards to 200 countries the vast majority of which they don't even have single employee in How would they handle customs bureaucracy logistics distribution marketing sales RMAs How many new people would they have to hire how many years and billions would it take to train and organize them You might suggest they just produce or rather have it manufactured for them and ship to vendors But someone still has to step in and do all the stuff AIBs do but not nearly as efficiently and they're gonna get paid somehow Is all of that worth it just for a chance to keep the razor thin margins they're currently giving AIBs
So you know more than AIBs and Nvidia employees
Now watch them rename it 4070 and retain the 900 price tag
Aahahahahaaa I thought this was the onion
What we think happened Nvidia was ashamed at the feedback from Reddit and Youtubers x200B What probably happened Nvidia spies at AMD telling them the new 7000 would ridicule the 4080 12GB
So what are the AIBs suppose to do now with all their cards with 4080 labels on them and boxes and such
Wow I had to do a double take cause I did not believe it A little cringe with the pics though
now they admit it lmao
While I am glad that Nvidia actually cancelled this ridiculous naming scheme it is just another move that screwed the AIB partners in general Let's remember that they never planned a FE edition for this card so for them to just unlaunch costs them practically nothing while giving their AIB partners the burden for this move
Now imagine AiBs at this stage both 4080s are already at end stages of mass manufacturing pipeline or waiting boxed in some
1200 for 4080 Really Isn't it so cheap
The card became a joke even before it launched I'm so happy of our community not putting up with Nvidia's bullshit on this one It's hardly believable They're probably waiting for 3000 stocks to be sold to launch the new 4070
If the lines around the block and enthusiasm for the 4090 is any indication the reception for the 4080 will be awesome Lmao not for 1200
So I m guessing this means the 4070 launch will be delayed as they rebrand every card A small amount of respect for admitting it but they shouldn t have resorted to scummy moves in the first place
Fucking LOL
Soon to be rebranded as the 4070ti and sold everywhere for 1000 at 50 performance cut to 4090
Nice Still not paying 1200 for the 4080 16gb though
bruh moment Now sell the 4080 16GB for 900
this must be terrible for partners to have to deal with this craziness
I wonder how angry some of the AIB's will be about this They likely already created alot of marketing material boxes manuals with the 4080 12GB branding Now they will either have to recreate it or slap a sticker on it
The era of 900 x070 and 1200 x080 graphic cards have arrived Remember the time when the 2080 was 799 and you lot thought it was a rip off
Holy fucking shit they actually admitted something was wrong
It looks like a fake article so 's make sense better to unlaunch a deliberate misinformated card than having to deal with 7000 lawsuits per day EDIT typo
This is just a misleading decision and a reframing attempt vs apology The 4080 12gb will be rebranded and launched probably as a 4070 12GB at 800 900
For press releases from Nvidia this is just genuinely looks rushed like the news came down from the top of the company very recently Still a solid win for consumers confusion should never be rewarded
L O freaking L
Nvidia is in a bad spot with the rest of their stack with how they've tried to position the cards The 4090 is incredible such a fast card and leap in performance The early leaks and looks at 4080 16 and 4080 12 are really bad given the price points 4080 12 slower than 3090ti 3090 3080ti 4080 16 not significantly faster but 1200 The 4090 is pretty expensive but it is the best flagship generational leap nvidia has put out in a long time AND it's a heavily cut down die There is a big chunk more performance coming when they release the 4090ti or whatever they're going to call it But the 4080 16 not flagships 4080 16 is still absurd 1200 I see price cuts coming on that card real fast if AMD manages to even just get in the same ballpark There are no truly bad products just bad prices and both these cards are way overpriced for what they deliver
What an incredibly rational turn as if NVIDIA marketers have realized how much of an absolute shit show RTX 4080 12GB would be Pretty much all the outlets and famous YouTubers have ridiculed the 12GB 4080 version Here's another idea NVIDIA You must decrease RTX 4080 16GB pricing by at least 200 300 and RTX 40 12GB by at least 100 200 Stop gouging Please You were you a consumer GPU company first You've not been a luxury GPUs provider only for the rich sans the crypto craze
Tomorrow will be the release of the 4070 12gb
good but shouldn't the 4080 16 gb be 899 then
A great step for Nvidia Now unlaunch the MSRP of the 4080 16GB back to 799 and we're all good
They should also drop the 4080 16gb msrp to 800
Wut is this real life
name it back to the RTX 4070 and give it a 600 price tag 900 is not even inflation thats just taking advantage of the PC community only the 4090 is priced for inflation the 4080 and 4070 are priced at 500 and 400 increase at MSRP over last gen
this card should be 4060Ti for 500 tops It's not even good enough to be called 4070 with its 192bit bus width People were not hard enough on it now they are going to get away selling this for 800 as 4070Ti Also 4080 16 isn't powerful enough for 1200 4090 is as much as 2x as fast in some cases Who would buy it just buy the 4090 It's way better
What will happen to 4080 12tb lol 4070 incoming GB my bad
899
Those cringe photos
How about make the 4080 16gb 900 instead then 1200 for a Non TI xx80 card is absurd
In a perfect world the 4090 should've been priced at 1100 and 4080 16GB priced at 800 Instead we got a crypto boom esque pricing of 1600 on their 4090 and 1200 for their 4080 Does Nvidia still think we have a mining craze right now People bought everything up because cards used to be literal money printers Not the case anymore Once this initial wave of enthusiasts get their 4090 I don't see people buying their 4000 cards much unless they drop their price
Honestly unexpected of Nvidia to do this I'm just glad people won't get confused now
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
I had to check multiple times to make sure it wasn't a hoax site lol Guess that 4090 reception made them not want to hurt their shine with the 12gb release or they know something AMD are doing
They actually listened for once
big if true
EVGA's CEO is somewhere laughing his butt off They saw the shit show a mile coming grimacing face
Good the name was straight up misleading
The 4080 16g is a crappy deal Look at the core count difference between it and the 4090 The 3080 was much closer to the 3090 in cores than the 40 series is You can bet the 4080ti will be much faster or at least it should be
So it's official then The 4080 costs 1200 a 500 increase from the previous gen xx80 card And the 4070 will surely take the place of the now unlaunched 4080 12GB at 899 What a sad fucking time to be a PC enthusiast gamer
There is one single person who approved the idea to call the 4070 the 4080 12gb There is also one single person who pitched it in the first place I'm very curious as to who these asshats are
They are fucked either way If they renamed it and changed the price people will just complain about how they tried to scam all of us by naming it 4080 in the first place If they kept the price no one would buy a 70 series for that price
EVGA really left at the right time
Introducing the all new 4070 12GB 899
The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card but it s not named right If the only problem is the name why unlaunch the card completely Why not rename it Is it because it should be named something like 4070 or 4060 ti and you don't wanna flat out admit that you were trying to scam people
Good start now they just need to lower the price of the 16GB one to 900
It's weird that they think people will be lining up for the 16gb instead of just skipping it and going to the 4090 If you're forking over so much money no point in half assing it
4080 16gb xx70 is crappy deal 4080 12gb 60Ti is crappy deal They only exist to make 4090 and 3080 look good in comparison to charge premium margins for early adopters and sell old stock People are so hanged up about semantics of naming yeah those 4080 were too different to be called same name that they missed that this generation we have hit VALUE REGRESSION first time ever since this century
Wow I thought it was April 1st for a second there I totally wasn't expecting them to admit to that lol
EVGA quit in right time They knew what's going to happen
Lets hope they also fix the but all models are still over the 1000NZD mark up price
Y'all keep buying Nvidia
Now drop the price of the 16gb rip off version to the same price as the 12gb and be fucking realistic
I love how they point to the lines around the block for 4090s as a sign that people want these price tiers as though 90 of those fuckers didn't go home and put them on eBay for 2x MSRP
Fellas we gotta put this one in a box with a different name on it they're on to us
This is the type of shit that EVGA were talking about I guess
The price of the 4080 16gb is still garbage I hate nvidia so much for killing the pc gaming hobby
No wonder eVGA left the biz
Translation WE thought we could get away with it turns out we couldn't
NEXT WEEK THE NEW RTX 4070
They will just rename it 4070 and call it a day
Oh man i was exiciting for Gamer Nexus to shit on it
Is this satire I honestly can't tell
Clowns
Holy shit I thought this is onion news or something Part of me thinks Nvidia did this as a pre planned thing Basically announce 4080 12GB at 900 and then retract so now everyone forgets that they increased 4080 price by 500 dollars compared to 3080 compared to 100 of 4090 Another part of me is that they saw the feedback everywhere Either way nothing changed for consumers It is what it is They aren't gonna change the 4080 16G price Will they still sell this for 900 Likely I think the criticism was not just superficial naming but the cost by association of the name 4080 Unlaunching it does nothing when cost remains same
No way they did this on their own Retailers or partners must have pushed back on it because they didn't want to deal with upset customers and constant returns or scams
Imagine your card is so dogshit that everyone could smell it and you had to cancel it lmao
WOW That's unexpected nVidia bullies gamers and gets bullied back by the media I wonder what they are going to try and change the spec to
Are they asking to be demolished by AMD with Price to Performance Ratio you can't just relaunch it as a 4070 for 800 or some shit
Now fix the 4080 16GB I honestly believe the 12GB was supposed to be a 4060 and the 16GB was supposed to be a 4070 They have 7680 9728 cuda cores vs the 4090's 16384 Joke cards
I have a 3070 and I love it But man Nvidia is a weird ass bitch company these
pressing the unlaunch button admitting it was stupid Sometimes I imagine a room full of people being the voice of sanity and being shut down There was a voice of reason they got shut down by marketing idiots
Please thank for this comment This guy helped us not to be a sheep
They need to unlaunch the 4080 16GB and then just launch it as a true 799 or 699 card Its just not worth it at that price point unless their entire idea is to segment everything one tier up Meaning that the 4070 will be the new xx80 series and so forth
The only thing that would make me applaud this stunt is that if the 4080 16 takes the 4080 12 pricing
I honestly thought this was a joke it wasn't LMAO
how embarrassing
Lmao wtf I don't think I've ever seen this Had to check the calendar if it's not April 1st face with tears of joy Though props for unlaunching it takes a lot to admit a fuckup hopefully 4070 will be launched with a bit more reasonable pricing Though RIP AIBs who already started printing the boxes and labeling the GPUs skull
Best news in the day Unbelievable
Wonder how Moore's Law will excuse not leaking this unicorn of a story face with rolling eyes
So what does this mean for all the AIBs that are in the final stages of manufacturing 3080 12GB boxes packaging hardware labels etc That's gotta be a huge setback to remake all that last minute
Can't wait for AMD to dunk on these clowns
look at these assholes trying to save
are they really crowing about artificial 4090 shortages god they can be so annoying at times
I'm stunned I didn't expect them to do the right thing Can they name it the 4070
I'm surprised
At least is a step foward to a better RTX 40 lineup of cards
I'll bet 900 bucks they won't be lowering the price
I actually thought it was fake There's no way they don't reduce the price now
Where's all the bootlickers that were defending it so hard saying just wait
Introducing 4090 12GB and 4090 16GB bitches
This means the MsRP jump from the 3080 to 4080 is 600
In a few months they'll launch it as the 4070ti with 100 less price drop the 4080ti at 1200 and reduce 4080 price to 1000 and drop 4070 with 100 less than 4070 ti with 10gb vram and cut down version of 4070ti or another GPU with less cores
I can t actually believe they are acknowledging the mistake I love this I would love a price decrease even more I bet they go 700 and delay the launch until more 3080 s have sold
So they realized we are not that stupid to buy a 4070 priced as 4080
LMFAO they tried to slip it past people and when it didn't work they backed up this doesn't earn them any good will from me at all try not trying in the first place next time
we are sorry for getting caught and deeply regret to postpone our scam it will be resurrected as 4070Ti to justify the 899 the real 4070 won t even beat a 3080 and will cost 699
LMFAO They really thought they could get away with this Big companies are wild man Completely living in a different reality than ours
Ok so why are they doing this what's the REAL reason
How about also unlaunching the 4090 and 4080 to set them at a lower price I want to see the Ebay scalpers cry
Oh so the scam didn t work What A Shame
is this real life
How embarrassing
The unlaunching doesn't change anything Nvidia is just saying that we aren't as dumb as they thought A price cut would've been enough but there is probably still too much Ampere stock Can't wait for rtx 4070 12gb and rtx 4070 10gb I also wouldn't be surprised if this gets renamed to rtx 4070 Ti so they can charge more A victory would be lower prices for both 4080 models but that didn't happen
Well bad news for people who is still waiting for 30 series prices to drop lol vendors and retailers will see that there are no competing cards under 1000 usd aside from RDNA 3 and keep high tier 30 series above 800 dollars Well time for another 3 4month wait boys regardless if you getting a high tier 30 or mid tier 40
I don't get why they did this tbh Those cards are manufactured already their names already printed hardware IDs already flashed They are just screwing over their AIB partners over some internet nerds getting mildly mad over this Also this blog seems really unprofessionally written What is going on in Nvidia HQ
Evga LOL
Sell it was a 4070 for 599 or 699 Drop the actual 4080 to 899 and it will seem more fair
Imagine all those wasted 4080 12gb boxes
Everyone please act like surprised
Basically they didn't want to have to drop the price on the 3090 and 3090 ti until they are sold out Let's hope AMD makes them pay for it
The fucking bozos tried to sell everyone a 4070 4060Ti and call it a 4080 They got enough shit for it that they're backing off
Is this because the naming was likely illegal in the EU under the consumer protection laws
Is this being released under the demand for GPUs are down due to less cryptocurrency mining but we're addicted to profit so we're going to hike the price because secretly we mock and hate you program or is it the one after this
this is so embarrassing lol
So what are we getting instead I can't afford a 1200 USD GPU it'll be 3000 NZD going off 4090 prices This just means I won't buy anything
Wow that makes such a huge difference now instead of people buying an xx80 card for 100 more and realizing they got ripped off they'll now just pay 500 more for the same generational improvement as the last generation and we'll have the privilege of paying 300 400 more for a xx70 card
QUICK GET THOSE 4070ti STICKERS ORDERED
This decision alone has lifted the performance of the potential RTX 4060 by a whole tier alone I just hope that they keep the prices at or below 500
Showing lines of scalpers nice
But what about the PC enthusiast Tech YouTubers that told me that this was fine and it was worth the price jump
Nerfvidia
Awful company My next GPU will be AMD for sure The greedy N DLSS 3 0
yay the 4070 is
I remember buying my first video card 6 megabytes Yep That was huge back in the mid 1990s Cost me a fortune
Good It s good that Nvidia listened to its customers This is a step in the right direction We should be supportive of step backs like this
They should relaunch it as the 4060ti With a 4060ti price
EVGA sighing with relief knowing they dodged a bullet
Worst grift I've seen from a tech company
They got caught red handed trying to sell a 4060 ti as a 4080
Somebody lost their job over this
We did it reddit s
I had to eat my own words when I said here that launching 2 widely different 4080 would be really dumb and that Nvidia wouldn t make that mistake because they weren t that dumb utm source share utm medium ios app utm name iossmf context 3 Glad to realize they reached now the same conclusion and fixing this mistake
GeCringe Series
People aren't happy with companies don't listen to complaints they are unhappy when a company responds to a complaint like what do you want a free GPU
It would be a 'fantastic' 4070 card for 500 otherwise GTFO with 900 pricing Same for the 1200 price for the 80 series card
clown faceclown faceclown faceclown faceclown face
I mean call it what you want just don't ask more than 500 for it
4080 is still overpriced Time for a 900 fucking dollar 4070
Hope the tech media wont let nvidia of the hook when 4080 16gb review rolls around its still a way too cut down and overpriced card This was just a straight scam however
This just shows how retarded this company is
What a fucking joke
Unlaunching the 12GB 4080 Launching the 4070ti
The techTubers are going to have a field day with this
I ll take why competition is good for 500 Alex
Lol at people who defended the indefensible RTX 4070 at 649 dollars would be a good start
The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card HAHAHAHAHA Then why are you unlaunching it The whole entire point of the criticism around it was that it was a horrid card you could get an equivalent 30 series for at or less than that POS If it's value is abysmal and it doesn't offer anything unique that other models of its ilk do how does that make it anything north of crap
Well that's a first
Unexpected from nvidia but this is a good 't really need to exist
Wow I really wasn't expecting Nvidia to do a whole 180 on that
In before they launch the 12GB as the 4080 and the 16GB as the TI
I don't even know what to say lol
Hahahah hello 3070 in December They cracked
No fucking way LMAO well atleast they admitted it here I thought they'd go full steam ahead with the false advertising Hopefully this means it gets relaunched as a 4070 at a lower price H
Posting in epic bread
Getting silly now they knew it was rediculous and did it anyway 10 minutes after reading this Scan UK restocked a bunch of 30 series cards 3060ti for 369 will do until a cheaper 40 series card comes around if ever
Calling it a 4070 is one thing But I can't see how it changes anything They cannot realistically now drop that to 499 599 and just say that is the price now But they can't release a 4070 at 900 either
Amazing they capitulated
Lol epic back pedalling
What a surprise Joke card in joke price what could be wrong Ah ya community backslash That what
And there it is about time
That last sentence and pictures are unnecessary
The card formally know
3000 series inflation prices for the 4000 series cards nice
Honestly im happy A better name scheme is a better naming scheme
What's the matter Nvidia Trying to purposely confuse your customers doesn't go over well
U kkkk
Wow Freaking leather jacket Hey guys i know the exact specs of the upcoming RTX 4070 rolling on the floor laughingface with tears of joyupside down facegrinning face with big eyesgrimacing face
Unlaunch the Kraken
This is just gonna add cost to an already costly card Everything that has a 4080 on it has to be reprinted new boxes and time it takes to do all that Seems dumb
lol this feels a lot less like we heard you and more like damn those 4090s sold fast let s hold off giving them an option for a cheaper card just yet
Wow this is real post on the official Nvidia website Read just like a drunk post on Twitter
Oh god I can hear the smugness in Linus's voice when he announces this on the WAN show already
that's hilarious since so many fanboys were salty that people rightfully called out nvidia on that bullcrap
absolutely insane sheeps will still buy
lmao no fucking way i have no words I can't believe they thought this would fly in the first trivially avoidable PR blunder
Wait is this real Wow im actually impressed they did this Pricing is still terrible compared to the 4090 but at least they came clean
Nice happy they did this and admitted their mistake
Radeon 7000 series about to crush this new nvidia lineup
This creates an interesting situation Surely it is Nvidia cannot be sure about fuckall B they cannot launch a 4070 above the msrp of the 3080 That would really bring the whole less for more greedy corp rally to nvidias front door Likewise they can't really drop the price of it either cause that will force the question of why the original price was justified in the first place and show the consumer that there's plenty of headroom on the prices This would affect 4080 immensely which is already suffering from having terrible value and spill onto the 4090 too While the 12GB 4080 was never an 80 class card they have truly put themselves in an awkward position here
I never thought I would see nvidia caving to consumer displeasure alone
nVidia 40Ain't
I thought it was weird they missed 4070 off the box
Don't worry they'll release the current stock that's already been made as a Limited Edition card
But I m not ok even with 4070 It should be 4060 Lets hope they will not unlaunch a not launched 4070
4090 price is not bad since it is their current best GPU but it would be more popular if it was 1500 4080 should ideally be 1000 max 4070 4070 ti or whatever they will call it 700 max and that's already a big jump in price vs Ampere Can't see people being happy to pay 1200 for a 4080 or 900 for a 4070
The jokes kinda write itself at this point
4080 and 4070 cough sorry 4080 12 GB are both about 300 400 USD too expensive anyway
It ll become the 4070 Then they will wave a wand and it ll magically be 700 They will market it as a 200 win for consumers but everyone will still scream at them it should be 100 dollars cheaper I recently read some rumors that it even struggled to outperform the 3080 Ti in certain games with dlss and rt off With so many 30 series cards in the market with plummeting price tags the 4080 12GB just didn t make much sense from a sensible financial standpoint
they are going to name it RTX 3070ti to keep the 900 price tag then have the other rtx 4070 that was suppose to be a 4060 700 nvidia why you charging extra 400 500 over previous gen thats not inflation thats greed
4075
Optimist They must be scared of RDNA 3 Pessimist Even though its price to performance was only slightly better than last gen at 900 the 4080 12gb was unlaunched to avoid competition with 3080ti 3090 and 3090Ti
holy shit were they hacked i can't believe this is real
I think it s funny they say now that the naming is confusing What do they mean by that They made the cards and named them and it never came up before There was not a single person who pointed this out until the presentation They believed they could get away with it and hoped many people wouldn t recognize the differences until it s too late but they now had to unlaunch it since it made big headlines
Yikes cancelling the launch this late will be super expensive not just for them but for the oems think about how many cards are already in shipping over to retailers how many coolers have been made specifically for this with rtx 4080 enblazened on the side
Take the 4080 16gb too while your at it nvidia
this will go down in history
Nice they should have just called the 12GB model the 4070 to begin with
This was a big brain move from nvidia the 4080 12 was never meant to see the light of day Now the 40 series is just two cards until the 30 series sells off
And I still only have 8GB ram 1Gb vram
They really posted a pic of the line in Tustin microcenter Those people are all scalpers
The price of a brick went up
Hahahahaha Jensen you son of a bitch you crack me up breh ha ha fuh that was good relieved face
Now supplying crytofarming near you with the new and bulkier 4080 Now with 30 percent more cooling power than a 5w table fan
Now 4070 8GB for 999 99
Allright fuck it unlaunches GPU
4080 12GB 4060ti for 900 was decoy so people forgot about real 4070 that is 4080 16GB for 1200
Every company I invest in forgets how to function as soon as I make my investment
The last pic though did they just make a joke about this subreddit Seatbelt GPU box lol
That's my new favorite word unlaunching Sorry boss I'm unlaunching the job I had to make a report on
Best thing they could have done to be honest Not sure what their marketing team was thinking
4070ti coming in hot n' ready Q3 2023 no teardownz plz Luv Jensen
So even if they re release this as the 4070 the 16GB 4080 still has a 70 mark up over the 3080 Not even trying to hide the greed
The 16gb 4080 is an even bigger scam than the 12 gb version Its 50 slower in rasterization than the 4090 and only about 10 better than the 3090ti Talk about a huge oof
Ultimately the right move by Nvidia Our customers were confused by the two cards having such a disparity in performance
dogshit company who else is dumping their NVDA after 2 years holding
It's a start The 16gb 4080 needs to drop in price by 40 minimum and the 12gb 4070 should drop by a slightly higher margin to have a hope of this launch being reasonable IMO The 4090 should drop by 25 30 too ideally but halo products with no competition currently have halo tier prices and it is an impressive piece of
Nvidia is such a shady company Caught with their pants down this time
You bunch of absolute chucklefucks
LoL fuckin clowns
Looks like EVGA jumped ship just in time Imagine the money that the AIB's have already spent on packaging and promotional materials just for Nvidia to cut and run leaving all of them holding the bag With EVGA saying that Nvidia has no respect for it's card producers last month something like this sure doesn't help matters any
Suck my dick Nvidia
A die die size between the 3060 and the 3060Ti Same bus than the 3060 The RTX4080 12GB should be the RTX4060 of this generation Selling it at 900 was so insane then even Nvidia has decided that it doesn't make sense and they are canceling it
This is a must to watch he explains the actual cost in total to make the 4080 12 16 and nvidia are ripping you off v 9 bqwEy5AQ4 t 75s
Watch them wait a few months and launch it agains this time named 4070
This might have been the one gpu that didn't sell even a single unit on launch day Everyone from reddit down to the family dog knew this POS was a scam
Good Now change the price of the 16gb variant
If the lines around the block and enthusiasm for the 4090 is any indication the reception for the 4080 will be awesome Lol yeah awesome Well it probably will be for Nvidia For the ones trying to buy the card the elation of the lucky few will be drowned out by the disappointment and frustration of everyone else
Holy shit we did it reddit
Um what How difficult is for nvidia to just be honest from the start and not get itself in that ridiculous situation
Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing lmao that's one way to spin it rolleyes
So yeah EVGA called it Team green is a bunch of dicks
EVGA got out just in time AiBs being shafted again
Holy fuck I wanted this but didn't believe it would be possible to even lower it's price by small amount but they really took it back lol I wanted to buy this card as it would be a good 3090ti alternative with newer tech that I wanted but couldn't stand supporting that they spat on us Hopefully it will comeback as a proper 3070 in November with lower price Shane the 3080 will not be lowered as well
The fact that they knew what they were trying to do thinking consumers won t know is already a testament of nvidias greed The performance is the only thing that keeps people buying their product i just hope one day a new competitor with similar power comes in but with integrity Its hard to be loyal to a company that lies to the ones who actually is the very reason why they are up there
Time to switch to team AMD There's no value card
What id like to see is the 4080 12gb become a 4070 or 4070ti even at around 699 750 max the 4080 then dropped to 999 1099 to make its cost vs relative performance to 4090 make more sense We shall see I have feeling the lower card will see a price adjustment but the higher card will not but one can hope
lol not even gonna throw them a bone here this was stupid from the start and we know nvidia isn't stupid i would bet that this sort of maneuver was planned so they could save face a bit later just in case or whatever
The shareholders got confused so Nvidia had to change it I reckon
Embarrassing
To make it clearer for the consumers they will rename it 4080 Super s
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
Wait is it fake
No evga what s the point even
Thanks nvidia Lol
Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing U 's not confusing you obtuse corporate f No one is confused about the 3060 3060 ti 3070 3070 ti 3080 3080 ti etc Now go ahead and drop THE 4080 MSRP where it belongs
Including a photo of the lineups of people waiting in line to buy your product on your own official website is super cocky
If the lines of scalpers are any evidence
I'm out of the loop on this what happened How are 2 cards different than the 1060 6GB and 1060 3GB Was the pricing way off or is there more
Relaunch the 12GB for 700 pounds and I'll buy it
I like how they're using photos of long lines of people see people love our 4090s when probably most of them are looking to scalp
Good I guess They really need to figure out that generation cause I'm building a new PC next year and so far the 30 series is looking a lot better than the 40 series
They must've gotten a glimpse of rdna 3 and understood they'd be priced out Wouldn't be surprised if they lower the price of the 16gb 4080 at launch
EVGA just keeps winning
Worst launch in history
What we hope to see Rebranding the 4080 12GB to a 4060 TI and pricing it at 699 USD What they'll probably do Rebranding it to a 4070 and pricing it at 799 USD
Ask you guys who defended this crap feel silky yet
EVGA looks like the guy that sold his whole basket the day before the crash
Does this mean he's taking his leather jacket off
So they will remove 2gb of ram and 200 from the price 4070 10gb
1 Unlaunching is not a real word 2 If it were then it d be defined by reversing the launch of or not to launch 3 Either way you play it you re out to launch
I ll NEVER buy a current year Nvidia card Way too much bullshit to deal with
Class action suit from AIBs soon Given Nvidia had no plans to launch an FE version this seems sketchy as
It looks like a 12 year old wrote it Fucking greedy Nvidia
When they re launch it I hope it's named the Butthurt Redditor model Cards with the same name but different RAM and GPU power have been a thing for 20 years but college kids who missed out on all of that lost their shit when it happened for the first time since they learned how to use a keyboard
Time to price drop the 4080 16GB next Terrible value at 1200 dollars
If they reduce the 4080 by 200 or 300 dollars it will be decent enough Still gonna try to get a 4090 though coz Im dumb
This makes me wonder what EVGA knew prior to pulling out of the market Perhaps they had some information that let them know Nividia was not going to be well liked and mocked for the 40 series launch I'm going team Red next year anyway
Clickbait title
Will NVIDIA ever learn
Turns out us gamers arent as stupid as Nvidia believed
Of course it s in the Friday news dump they ve been trying to figure out how to mitigate this since the announcement and are embarrassed Also a few tech tubers were saying how you don t get to name the card Nvidia does How wrong and naive Widespread mockery works corporations don t like to be viewed as incompetent
ok and
Those lines you re touting about is because you can t buy them online anywhere at msrp Don t confuse excitement with necessity And now that you re pulling the 4080 12GB cards off the shelves there s going to be even less supply Good job
Now that we sell well the 4090 we took a decision
Something big should've happened prior to that Real danger of winnable lawsuits perhaps
Why are 2 confusing 1060 3gb 1060 6gb
Wait you can unlaunch a card Is it just discontinued This is so embarrassing
Do you know what time Eastern this will be released on November 16th
Instead of adjusting the price they decided to scrap the whole thing Tone deaf
Damn Big A got out at the right time
All these comments here giving them shit Do you want companies to admit mistakes or not
Inb4 people get mad that a company listened to their feedback bc they knew it all along
Everyone is constantly applauding what EVGA did What they did was let go of 80 of their companies revenue With no alternative in line to replace said lost revenue They will have to layoff a massive amount of their workforce eventually due to the amount of work being done being drastically reduced There bottom line will greatly suffer perhaps to the point of not being able to survive So EVGA didn't make some great decision What they did was make an emotional decision that is a detriment to their business
Meanwhile they re restocking 30 series FE cars pretty much in every official channel here in Europe They re just a joke of a company priding themselves for a great 4090 launch when nobody asked them
As someone who's trying to comprehend what's going on anyone wanna ELI5 please
Watch next week introducing the 4070ti rolling on the floor laughing
Press F for nvidia wallet How could customers dare to question a decision by the almighty company
Wait This is real
Holy shit
they'll probably re release it at a 11GB 4070
Wish I had a store to lineup in locally
Imagine what could be done if people held them to standard for the 4080 and 4090
marketing has left the chat Do
They're soon gonna unveil the 4070 just watch
I assume until proven otherwise this is just to rename their existing stock to something and keep the price tag Maybe 4070ti or some shit
I have to think that they must've anticipated some pushback But I guess it was far worse than they anticipated
Eli5 Idk wtf is going on with Nvidia hate situation can someone fill me in I'm clearly very ootl
and now for the 16 gb nvidia
didnt they have a Super designation Could have used that to differentiate
So in 2 months are they going to be launching the 4070 with 12GB Memory
Lmaooooo
How does this fit in with Igor's theory Exactly at this point I ll add a speculation that might also explain why NVIDIA turned the originally planned RTX 4070 into a neutered RTX 4080 12GB After all there is still a lot of space between both RTX 4080s and more fits in between so it is only a thin sheet of paper For example a fat Navi 31 box NVIDIA s spy investigative department has very rarely been wrong in the last few years and so a green sandwich would actually be more than just schadenfreude but almost a provocation I don t presume to be able to really assess AMD s next generation but according to all available information it should hardly be possible to create the targeted power consumption AND increase the performance as much as NVIDIA might have managed thanks to TSMC with the older nodes Why would Nvidia just give up on all the schadenfreude provocation they made the 4080 12GB for
Is that the Parkville Microcenter in the press release Kinda cool
Please welcome 4070
They will probably call it 4070 and sell it for 800
My guess it will be renamed to 4070ti price will be 699 and release in the spring of 2023
This is hilarious NVidia constantly missing the mark with consumers world wide
HAHAHAA What a joke
Wut
Egg on their face but this is how intel should have handled the Arc A series launch I said before that if AMD or NVIDIA had that Arc fiasco on their hands they would have simply walked it back long time ago The 4080 12GB was a scam due to the price and name but at least a working Ada Lovelace product
I didn't expect the article to be so short No explanation by them at all other than confusion
this is hilarious
4080 MX
They finally admit it Along with the 4060 launch we re gonna see a very familiar 4070
Wow i thought this was a joke at first Good to see nvidia pull their heads out of their own asses for once I guess they finally realized they were about to be raked over the coals by most reviewers The naming was very deceptive The price was too high as it was just too high
Lmao they actually did it When has a a GPU ever been unlaunched
An unlaunch Holy shit any PR is good PR huh
Wait so what are they going to do with all the 4080 12gb cards that have with the 4080 etching they have on them
Nvidia coming back to sense only possible when there are no gpu miners around
hahaah they Flinched
Hey come buy our cards that we might have in stock at some point Look at all the people that want one you should stand in line to get some of our very limited stock too Better yet we know you want to get your hands on one how about you sign up for a queue and we'll let you know when they come back into there's stock in stores now we removed the queue and you can go get one anywhere Stock 0 at bestbuy amazon newegg
Nice try
They realised it'll look doubly bad if AMD releases a 7700XT that beats the 4080 12GB for less than 899
Holy shit they're actually pulling it and renaming it I mean yeah it was an awful idea having two 4080s with two different dies and performance but I didn't think they'd actually admit it and change course
I was wondering what would happen to the 3080 Ti price since it's still going for 900 Maybe now they won't have to lower prices further on 30 stock to make room for a 900 40 card
So they going to explain anything else Like what it will be called Adjustments in pricing on either of the cards once known as 4080 Im glad they addressed this I personally never cared and knew it wouldn't be an issue for people in the know but yea can see how maybe regular folks could somehow get screwed someway by it I mean unless they adjust pricing the impact would have only been thay you bought one card thay seemed to have a name similar to a much more expensive card but you also paid significantly less so it would somewhat balance out If they change the name to 4070 or 4070ti but keep the pricing nothing changes except the words on the box so again nothing that is really impactful Just pick the card that gives the performance you want in games you play and for the money you can 't be
With this launch cut I expect the demand and price for and 3080 ti 3090 cards to probably jump a bit Since this card now has no set date of release and was most comparable to the 80ti 90 they are likely to be more in demand
So we won
Now I wonder under what form will this GPU reappear RTX 4070 or RTX 4070TI
This was all planned from the beginning lol you're not fooling anyone
Maybe this is 4D chess by Nvidia They want to release the 4080 at 1200 but was afraid of backlash so they release 2 different versions and make it obvious that a 4070 turned into 4080 12gb People outraged over 12gb version so they happily remove it and act like they did customers a favor And now they can release their 4080 at 1200 and have attention diverted away from this model
I cannot believe this is a real article lol Good on them I suppose At least they acknowledge their mistake
Surprising but welcome Hopefully this card will be a 4070 at 500 600 as it always should have been
Surprised they didn't go We are unlaunching the 4080 16GB
Bruh moment
Evga continues to look more more like geniuses each passing week Lol thinking face
wow seems that somebody gave jensen his medics finaly
lmao and I got downvoted to shit for saying that the pics of people lining up around the block for these cards were morons They proved Nvidia's point to a fucking t
Wow I didn't think they would walk this back
I'm speculating that this specification is now being saved for a rainy day and being rebadged RTX 4070 Ti with the rumoured 7168SP 10GB config coming back as the 4070
So let me see if I follow The 4090ti melted PSUs so they decided to shitcan that card Feeling like without a 4090ti they shouldn t have a 4080ti so removed that branding from the 16gb version Then someone tried to explain benchmarks for the upcoming 4080 to someone and then realized they had to give two sets of benchmarks and two different prices for a card with the same name So now they re unlaunching the 12gb version Hahaha Wtf
I hope they understand the mistake they did and rename it as 4070 and sell with a more reasonable price I want to think optimistically
Abortion for the 12gb 4080 4070
Better late than never Good move Nvidia
S or what It's a fantastic card but it's being unlaunched with no word about where it goes from here
Removing 12gb Nvidia will still be charging on 95 ob 3080 10gb for 1269 for fe if you have principles intelligence and logic do not bend over you and let Nvidia rip you off the price to performance is terrible
Good Hopefully they will have clearer naming going forward That said I'm guessing one reason they are holding it back is to improve 30 series sales P S is this the first time we hear of Nov 16th as the launch date
lol
Imagine this was written and released by some intern who was pissed off at the company lol
Of course they used pics of people camping outside Micro Center to say the 4090 was successful those are scalpers baby Not people actually using the GPU
They probably already had another chip waiting to fill the 4070 spot So 4075 confirmed
4070
Better downgrade the price when they relaunch it as the 4070 it always was Doubt AMD will win the performance game but I'm sure they'll win on price performance
This is the right move
Lol and they also released performance increasing drivers for 3000 series They are trying to make themselves the good guys in the eyes of the customer
Thought this was a shitpost at first Scam didn't work out
They weren't able to fit the card through the entrance gate
Lol
Feels so bad Yuck
This is good news however you look at it Either they actually cared about the backlash or they know something new about the competition Very interested to see what happens next
They made the right move for once Now just drop the 4080 16GB to 800 900 and release a 4080ti for the 1200 price tag that actually competes with the 4090
Rename it to the 4080PU D
Feels good when companies dont get away with this behaviour
Thank fuck
My guess is they will rename the 12GB 4080 to the GeForce RTX 4080 SE
Out freaking standing I'm going to be upgrading this year so I'm curious to see if nvidia will keep me on green team or not I wanted to get the 4080 12gb but not for the price tag so if they lower that price I'm in
That's their entire press release
Comedy Central
Bwaaaaaah ah ah ah rolling on the floor laughing Seriously Nvidia multi billion
Nvidia is so dumb
Absolute clown face business
Good
This reads as such bullshit They got greedy and the fans responded
If they keep the price for the 4080 12gb and the price is increased by 500 in Germany it would be cheaper to buy a 3090TI or a 6950XT and a 5800X3D Big scam
Lmfao this makes the price tag of the 4080 even worse to me At least before you could turn off your brain and be like well they only increased the price by 200 Cant wait to see this just be the 4070 or the ti version for 800
So if the cooler is the same fucking size what exactly are people going to do with regards to stuffing this thing in their case lol Like there have to be a handful of enthusiasts cases that these cards actually fit in I get it for the 4090 but for the rest of the line up why on earth and they using the same clown cooler Am I missing something here I've already seen multiple posts with people expressing dismay that the insanely over engineered cooler the size of a cars engine block doesn't fit
Ahh so this is the plan to drive their profits force their sub manufacturers to do it by making the market value higher with time spent towards unfucking a situation like this
This is gold I mean green
Ahah what a fail At least we know the 4070's specs now v
I hope they also backtrack on DLSS 3 lockup on older cards At least even if it gives some frame drops give me the toggle lemme choose myself
They could unlaunch it and rename it to become the Drum roll 4070
man it took like 2 days from anyone who buys a 4090 is fuckin idiot to the 4090 is a great card
4070 1 2
Call it a 4070 and drop the price to a cool 699
They are probably gonna do something stupid and call it a 4070 ti with a 1200 price tag cause they
Saw this
If we get lucky it becomes the 4060ti 4070 would be a sort of acceptable outcome if it s renamed 4070ti I ll still be disappointed in them
That's the micro center in Tustin Always huge lines on drop days
Wait They have a new idea 4075 Everything will be solved rolling on the floor laughing
I remember being worried about the future sustainability of EVGA considering how much of their business was GPUs Now I see that they were actually just 2 steps ahead of the incoming shit hurricane
Price went up to cover the new boxes
Historical
Wtf lol
Pop
4070 ti
Does this mean that the 4080 16 GB will be launched at a lower price
I like when I see the same thing on 40 000 different
If I have no GPU now but have a 1000 1200 budget what do I do
4070ti
So Now the more expensive 4080 is the only one getting sold Lol Everone who actually wanted the 4070 in disguise for 900 dollars now just has the more expensive 4080 Nvidia is just a scummy business
So what happens to the 500 000 Boxed 12GB 4080 just sitting in Warehouses in L A and QuongDong Are they repackaged as RTX 4070 s
I had to check 5 times this wasn't some kind of satire and that's the actual Nvidia website and this is really a thing Are they huffing glue by the buckets or what tf is going on there
How long until they backpedal on DLSS 3 also
retailers and aib have lots of 30 cards still laying 's dont sell those retailers and aib that means they gonna be stuck with 30 cards and 4080 inventory they cant get rid of
lol
I need a small form factor 4060 or no balls
RTX 4080 12gb should be renamed the RTX 4070 Price drop to 600 650 OG RTX 4070 should be renamed the RTX 4069 Priced at 420 69 Nice
Lol
Should have just dropped the price to 700 now the 4080 is almost double the price of 3080 launch price It makes the generational leap non existent as it's just a different product class all together
Got my 3070 and I ain't buying anything new for the next 3 5 years Hopefully Nvidia will get some competition by then
MILD has infornation that the 4080 16Gb AD103 was meant ro be a 4070 and in his opinion which i agre a reasonable ish prive would be 799 v IpkGYTypOyc t 1003s
Im not sure why they bother to change the name since they already decided to milk money n deceive the customers Does the general masses consumer not hardware enthusiast people here actually knows the difference Are the impact bad enough to sully their reputation that it impact sales
Ok if NVIDIA launched the 4090 at like 1 2k MSRP they would've been in uuhhh ok sure whatever territory and the launch wouldn't have been such a shitshow
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Must of ran out of glizzies
AMD literally can't fuck this up A 7800xt for 700 800 should do the trick for me to upgrade from my 3080
This honestly seems planned by them with the idea they were maybe going to get brownie points for changing it and I bet they are actually reducing the price by 100 then calling the 4070
It was the 4070 Then through bad decisions became the 4080 12GB Then through bad save face became nothing
Ok good now DLSS 3 for 30 and 20 series cards
Friends who will open on November 16 will be 800 to 850 dollars
Dont you think the fact they display those pict is a sign that it didn't sale as expected
The 16 GB version is 4080 and 12gb I've seen online is more likely 4070ti
Fuck this shit
They should have posted a picture of the 4090 ebay listings too rolling on the floor laughing
Getting renamed to rtx 4070ti for sure
I wonder if someone did buy the 4080 12GB at launch would they show it off here I think everyone would mock make fun of and bully that person lol
I say relaunch it again Just go with the flow 4080 12 GB old 4070 Then 4080 8gb 4060 and you can throw in the useless 4080 3gb old 4050 Obviously you need space for 4080 6gb 4050 TI Just use only 4080 for games and get 4090 if you really want 60fps on 1080p with RT on
And the expression pulling an Nvidia was born
This was an out of season April fools joke
Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing Flashbacks to the GT 1030 where one of the versions had literally half the performance DDR4 vs GDDR5 of the other one but was sold under the same name
4080 feather lite edition FTFY
Lulz
Goodbye 2 slot xx80 card
Why can t I reorder comments I want to see new
No need to thank us
I mean thats what they're going to do
Yeah though I think it will be the 4070 Ti that is the worry since they only mentioned the name being bad not the price Another thing to worry about is this is an about face to delay cards even further because Ampere stock is even higher than expected At 900 the 4080 12GB was the only launch lineup card that competed with current Ampere cards 3090 3090 Ti
That would actually be worse than having two 4080s with different specifications That would just seem like they increased the price of the 4070 Anything less than a name change and price reduction wouldn t work
Doesn't change the fact it's a 4060
I'm just happy they did this at least but yeah if they keep that 900 price tag then it's some BS
Well even in that case it is still a good move Yes the price is extremely ridiculous for a x70 card but with this change the good news is Nvidia indirectly admitted the card is not x80 tier so they pretty much said in public they were greedy bastards and they screwed up This gives hope for models down the product stack Everyone was afraid that if one of the 2 x80 models couldn't even match the 3090Ti the originally planned 4070 10GB and 4060 8GB would be terrible products I guess Nvidia realized that the planned 4070 having 3080 levels of performance was a terrible idea especially when people are expecting a 699 price tag or something close to that Maybe now the upcoming 4060 will be close to the 3080 and have reasonable specs instead of sitting between the 3070 and 3070Ti The 4080 12GB rebranded as the 4070 Ti will be close to the 3090 so pretty much what we were originally expecting At least now the upcoming lesser products might not be DOA The 4060 would be at best on par with a 3070Ti so the jump from the 3060Ti would only be 20 This would be the second time in a row the x60 card had miniscule performance jump between generations The last x60 card that was vastly better than its predecessor was the 2060 The improvements in the lower end products has stagnated since 2018 It's ridiculous It's time we get a real x60 card instead of the crap Nvidia was planning to give us
Shhhh Don t give them ideas
Go the AMD route the 4075 12GB
It's not a 4070 it's a 4060ti They named it 4080 so people wouldn't complain when it got downgraded to 4070 which is still too high
That's almost definitely what's going to happen
4070 Ti
and thread
Going to be 4070ti
Maybe they rename it the 4090 12G s
4075
i bet its going to be 899 99 P
Its not named right the 4080 lite or 4079 99
Well I dropped out of the GPU race was in there for a short period of time anyway When my trusty 2080 does not make it anymore I will have a look at the gen before the current one and very like likely go AMD anyway
see that is a fair tactic for consumers rather than trying to trick them into thinking they got a deal on price performance of a 4080 for 'only' 900
Just cross out the 80 on the box Fully re using everything Fixed Thanks Nvidia
That would the the funniest possible outcome
I was about to say this fuckers aren t going to change the price
Don't believe rediculous they're not that petty I bet they'll drop the price take to 895 99
RTX 4075
The 4080 12G looked in early benchmarks like a low wattage 3090 3090 Ti with a slightly better price Unlaunching helps to sell the 3090 3090 Ti's NVIDIA just removed a direct slightly cheaper alternative to last gens high end
900 10 because of the sticker
Watch lines forming at microcenter waiting for the 4070 at 899 lmao
4070 Ti is my guess
What would make people happy Rename it the 4070 and drop the price to 700
Well they literally said it s just not named right not priced just named
You think they're going to lower the price over a confusing name As an apology
And it's still a no for me all the 4000 series are fucking overpriced
Nvidia you spoke we listened
4079 coming
You mean 4060Ti
GN confirmed that price is changing The partner said nvidia is not that stupid
It's gonna be a cut down 10 gig version for 850 thanks Nvidia
Yeah but they'll reduce the memory to 8 10GB
This is absolutely what's going to happen
Am i the only who think it should be rename 4060 ti according to the difference with the 4090 and that the 4080 16Go should be call 4070
I wonder how board partners are going to rebrand those already out of the production line
11 5 12 o 10 12 stars Like past
4070Ti
which would still be better
No they will launch it at 750 but in February when they would have had to lower the price of the whole lineup anyway because of competition In the meantime they get to cash out on the most profitable skus and deplete the 3000s stocks win win
It's funny because everyone is here in complete understanding of how Nvidia fucks everyone over constantly but also posting their 4090 pics Has me cracking up
I checked both the domain 3 times and the certificate twice I thought I was on onion as well
Seriously never expected Nvidia to backtrack on it Reception of 4090 is so good that they decided to improve their PR
Hard Drive
that was clear that amd has at least 4080 16gb competitor they will beat this 12gb one with easy
God I hope so
My head canon is that me calling the 4090 a 4080 24GB did the job
What really happens AMD 7900XT crushes the 4080 16GB and is 300 less
What's probably going to happen 4080 16GB will sell out too 4070 will be announced Everyone wins
Can't let their 70 class card destroy your 80 class card
I'd like to imagine their developers couldn't figure out how to list two 4080s in the database and it was just easier to rename the series
Nvidia spies at AMD Isn't Lisa Su related to Jensen in some way
Even if the 7X00 didn't ridicule the 4080 12GB AMD could've still benefited by comparing against it Ex The RX 7800XT trades blows with the RTX 4080 Then way down in the fine print 4080 12GB
Anyone see it as bad news The reception of 4090 was so strong they probably got confident the 4080 16gb will sell really well too and there is no need to launch a 4080 12gb to eat into 3090s sale
What also likely happened Nvidia We still have a shitload of 3090s and 3090 Ti's to sell
Has any AMD GPU ridiculed an Nvidia GPU in the last 8 years Steam charts are dominated by Nvidia GPUs still Doubt it will change this time around
Definitely not the 1st
I'm guessing that some lawyer types who made money off the 970 fiasco called up and asked them where they'd like copies of everything sent on launch day
Not that hard to do when Ampere already ridicules it
I mean it s quite possible The rasterisation on the 6900 cards is really good
Nvidia spies at AMD telling them the new 7000 would ridicule the 4080 12GB Yes this is what I thought too and probably way cheaper than 4080 12GB
I am sure that both AMD and nVidia know a great deal about each other before launch Also remember that this is an oligopoly and oligopolies tend to share information and fix the market It is ilegal buy they do it because it is really profitable It would be a big and pleasant surprise if AMD undercuts nVidia pricing by a fair margin but I don't think so
EVGA should be very happy about their choice to leave the clown fiesta just look at 4080 AIB sizes it's the same as stupid 4090 next gen consoles lmao
So what are the AIBs suppose to do now Take their already razor thin margins and shove them right up their ass They'll have to put a sticker on the box or rebox replace the serial sticker on the card potentially cover up or completely replace any branding on the heatsink replace the manual and flash a new vBIOS with the correct name All that is going to cost money probably enough to put them in the red on already manufactured stock and Nvidia will tell them to get fucked about it Remember when EVGA cited disrepect as their reason for bailing You're seeing it in real time Nvidia does not give a flying fuck about their partners
Reprints are expensive Sharpies and Post its though Much cheaper RTX 40keycap 70
Nvidia knew this would happen which is why there was never a 4080 12gb FE They fucked their AIB vendors twice with this move
Getting fucked by Nvidia I wonder if Nvidia will do anything about it like some marketing funds or something
Boxes and marketing material to the landfill some might have stickers Depending on design I guess the shroud can potentially be reused and the cooler repurposed for 4070 or whatever nvidia names it I hope nvidia pays them for the lost production time could have been making 4090s labor refactoring redoing marketing assembly line tweaks and material Else I can sort of see the AIBs potentially mad enough to file for a lawsuit AIB profit margins are low enough as is according to the insiders the whole EVGA thing is even more understandable
Stickers
EVGA did some great 4D chess
Have we actually seen any real photos of those yet
They can do stickers
A sticker over the 4080 name LOL
I doubt they have many if any boxes printed for the 4080 12GB No release date was even given yet
Wait a few months and put them in boxes labelled 4070
Still launch them as a Limited Edition card lol
Probably sell them to OEMs or Universities as semi custom
Well the boxes are useless now but the card's shroud might only say 4080 so they can reuse on the 16gb version
Slap a sticker on it
I will gladly buy a 4070 that is mislabeled as a 4080 for a cool 40 off Hit me up MSI You have my email
Stickers exists
Nvidia probably
Just wack a sticker saying 16GB now on them instead of 12GB
EVGA decision seems like 5d chess now
Who cares unless you own one of those companies They can figure it out
Nothing More than likely the 12 gig 4080 was always going to be rebranded to the 4070 Nvidia just did this to make everybody comfortable with a 4070 being 900
This is
They probably learned about this the same way we did too
Make a lite edition 2 years later
Nvidia that sounds like a you problem
Game companies used to use one box for every console because there were a dozen different computers and a dozen different game consoles in the 80s They would just slap a sticker over the system requirements label and call it a day
it is much worse if the AIBs already sent some stock to their Distibutors retails
And also meaningless if they relaunch it as a 4070 with the same price There would be a lot fewer complaints if the price and price performance were good and just the name didn't fit the card
Edit Nvidia has taken down my photo after I submitted a DMCA Takedown info on submitting a DMCA takedown to Nvidia can be found here A little cringe with the pics though Yeah one of those photo's is one that I took No one from Nvidia reached out to me for permission to use it or modify it
lol i was thinking the same thing it's like they are bragging and at the same time using people's waiting in line pics from social media as validation lmao
The pics were literally screaming Look we charged them for a leg and a liver and those idiots were still staying in line to buy our overpriced products let's increase the prices even more for the next series because they will pay us no matter what
They should ve used this picture and give credits to the people posting the madness of scalper zombie campers
Eh I don't really think the pics are cringe The 4090 really is a solid card and still has better frames dollar than the 3090 It's not surprising that demand is so high for it The only thing that would be cringe at this point is if they rename the 4080 12GB to the 4070 but keep the 899 pricing
The pics were an offensive PR move You see this all the time with any company trying to give some good news spin to deflect the negative press But the release was so soon They had to have manufactured a bunch of these cards already So I can t imagine they would all be repurposed for parts
I honestly though it's a troll site at first You know nvidea isntead of nvidia or something one letter difference
Surely they could've chosen a better pic than a 4090 strapped to a stained car seat
Imagine you are an executive and make such a clueless decision What were they thinking
I read it read the url read it again and still don t believe it Incredible confusing
EVGA having a laugh imagine the AIB's having to re design cards because of the looks
We re so glad thousands of you lined up helplessly to scalp and walk away empty handed
I've been watching them tank their stock price over the last year but lurching from one stupid decision to another It's absolutely mindblowing that had you asked anyone this time last year you'd have been told they were the best option on the market These days I'd seriously consider going towards other cards for a new computer if this sort of thing continues
That'
So Nvidia responded to the criticism by doing the right thing Props This plus their verified gamers program to help reduce scalping shows how responsive Nvidia can be
They only thing they admit is that the naming is confusing They say nothing about the 12GB model being overpriced for what it is
At this point this seems like some sort of a 3D chess play to force AIBs to abandon Nividia so Nividia can vertically integrate their GPU manufacturing business Because I can't think of any other reasonable logic of yanking the leashes on the AIBs repeatedly
oof This is a great point EVGA looing like geniuses in retrospect
Exactly the axed version was the one that didn't have a FE So everything is AIB not Nvidia
They'll probably stick 'em in OEM prebuild PCs
I'm interested to hear AiB response to this
You can only call it Not putting up with Nvidia s bullshit if people don t still buy it for the same price
not putting up with Nvidia's bullshit lmao hope you're ready to hold the Ls when this sub is flooded with posts by redditors who've spent thousands for minor marginal performance bumps next month or this week I guess
I can't even buy a 3080 and up on Amazon that's not a lower end model for non scalper prices Tuf 3080 is going for like 850 at least So basically my choices are settle for a 3070 or pony up for 4080 4090 can't really go amd because my monitor is older gsync and thus not freesync compatible What a shitty market situation
4090 despite is crazy price considering the price to performance it is still a good deal if you can actually utilize all that performance 4080s are just turd lol
I love how they talked about the lines around the block like it was good thing
Get me some interns and some sharpies I will get it done in a day
Nah more like delayed till they sell through the 3000 series overstock at current prices They refuse to let the 3000 series lower any further so relaunching as a 4070 at a lower price point now would just demolish the current 3000 series prices and ruin their entire strategy Thats why they just canceled it instead with no word of a rename relaunch This thing won't launch till well into next year when 3000 series overstock is gone at current prices I'd bet on it Consumers didn't win here at all they're just continuing their strategy of layering 4000 series on top of 3000 series till overstock is gone Nvidia greed being nvidia greed Only hope in a change in their strategy would be if AMD decides to actually bring good prices that blow away Nvidias current price performance which unfortunately won't hold my breath for
Sticker on cards and be done with it D
I bought my 3070 ti my for that price in Yes I m an idiot
If Nvidia's slides are to be believed the RTX 4080 16GB is already only 50 of the performance of a 4090 grimacing face
Surprised this isn't talked about more
Or hear me out Go back to 500 for the 80 series like 1080 This mentality shows how Nvidia normalized insane pricing with their 2000 3000 series There is such a large gap between the 4080 and 4090 they are clearly setting up a strong 4080ti Which means with their current pricing the ti will be significantly faster for not much more And if the price did go down to 900 you re still dealing with a 1200 potential ti The margins for these cards are higher than any 80s series before even if Nvidia pretends otherwise Excluding the crypto boom
750 would be more appropriate compared to the 3080 900 is still far too expensive for an 80 class card
Even that price is shit
Yes pls
You gotta give them props for listening to the overwhelming feedback For the 4080 vote with your wallet
They will once they sell out of 3080s and 3090s
More like 500 600 bucks Crypto proof of work is dead there is literally no reason at all to keep these inflated prices as is
Still too expensive
Which might explain why EVGA left
Stickers for existing boxes is likely Unless NVIDIA mandates whole new boxes Edit GN video suggests NVIDIA has mandated new boxes I hope someone grabs a collectors item in the manufacturing before they all get sent to cardboard recycling D Cards some AIBs do not actually have the number visible on the card only in the S N sticker So reflash bios replace S N sticker with right model number repack Annoying especially having to replace fix the box but not the end of the world
We're also living in a world where consoles are cheaper than one PC component The trend is clear
They didn't admit shit they were caught red handed trying to scam their user base and now they're trying to save face In fact I bet they'll rebrand it a 4070 which is exactly what it was in the first place but still sell it for over 800 that's about as far as you can get from admitting something was wrong
But they didn t say they would change the price
They knew exactly what they were doing I'm sure there were many discussions about it at the maximize profits meetings They would have run many models on how many cards they expect to sell at what specs and what pricing Its also no secret that the average consumer is pretty dumb they are easily fooled they are easily influenced For every tech savy person who saw through this bullshit there are dozens or hundreds more who would have just believed it NOTE I am not dissing nvidia with the maximize profit meetings comment Every company has maximize profits but at least its a little less bad now that they have changed course still a black mark tho
Wonder if they got permission from the photo owners to utilize the photos
From 500 for a 3070 to 850 for a 4070 hurts I hope whatever 40 series card is at the 500 price range is worth the two years between release dates
Which is perfectly fine as that is what the card should have been in the first place What would suck is if they still keep the same pricing or close to it
Still a solid win for consumers If they lower the 900 would be an even bigger disaster
Agreed it s super abrupt very short and offers zero insight about how the existing supply of 4080 12GB cards will be handled doesn t this news really screw over board partners that now have a ton of supply they have to rebrand or shift around somehow
Edit Nvidia has taken down my photo after I submitted a DMCA Takedown info on submitting a DMCA takedown to Nvidia can be found here I can confirm that they failed to acquire a usage license for at least one of those photo's I'm the one that took it and I haven't had anyone from Nvidia contact me so it's certainly possible it was rushed Either that or they don't respect copyright if they think they can get away with it
For press releases from Nvidia I actually assumed this was a photoshopped fake page
Yeah this announcement looks like an intern did it and didn't get any second set of eyes on it
3090TI very similar raster performance to the 4080 16 gig Nvidia has literally stopped showing the 3090TI and 3080TI in head to head performance comparisons because they re so close to the 4080 And the 4080 is more expensive I have maintained to this point and will continue to maintain that people are not buying an upgrade this gen You re buying DLSS3 0 In other words this is a pointless lateral generation and you would have to have more money than brains to buy a 4080
They should have just launched the 4090 and nothing else Nobody would be complaining
You've not been a luxury GPUs provider only for the rich sans the crypto craze That's exactly what they want to become though Or even better they want to be Apple a purveyor of luxury products with prices and margins to match that somehow has mass market appeal and sales numbers
4079 12GB
It should be lower Look at charts without dlss 3 it seems like it should be a 4070 They are still trying to scam us
750 since the 3080 was 700 The aibs will push the price to 850 900
That will only happen if AMD launches something better at a lower price
Nvidia wants the users to buy the 4090 That's why it's so good compared to 4080 16gb
4080 12TB lol
4070 Ti Or Super so they can release a shitty 4070 and stay on track They'll just admit the 4080 12 GB didn't fully fulfill the expectations for a flagship card but it's too powerful to be a 4070 either
4070 ti so they can keep the planned 4070
Yeah it will probably be renamed to 3070 slightly lowered price Love this as it seems to be a very good card just bad in pricing especially seeing the good 4090 and the whole Nvidia spitting on people by calling it 3080
3070 super ti
Seems like a good opportunity for Nvidia to hold off and see what AMD announces in November and the price accordingly right away with the new 12 GB whether it be a 4060 or 4070
I'm going to go ahead and guess nothing for a long time I think they're going to shelve it till well into next year when the 3000 series inventory gets sold through Because lowering it's price now just ruins their entire stategy of continuing to sell their 3000 series at current prices Basically they lowered the MSRP of the super overpriced super high margin 3000 series gpus like the Tis and the 3090 but the 3080 and below they refuse to lower at all There's no win here for consumers they didn't lower the ridiculously overpriced 1200 4080 and they just canceled this one instead of lowering it They'll relaunch it for cheaper only when the 3000 series overstock is gone So yea nothing good on horizon anytime
Most likely it will become a 4070 like it should have been
I haven t really been paying attention to the 4000 series lineup have they previously announced a 4070 yet
Rebranded to 4070 like originally intended delayed until they get rid of some 30 series stock then relaunched at a lower but still very expensive price
And poof then you woke up and it was all a dream Not going to happen at least not until they are literally rotting on the shelves and nobody is buying one So needs at least a few months
Cringe subjects in the photos or cringe by Nvidia for using them as arguments in their favor
Does Nvidia still think we have a mining craze right now The fact that as of yesterday when they removed LHR on cards yes
yeah if you could get one at MSRP it was stupid to not buy a 3090 I made about 4k in mining from 2020 2022 Usually I only go for whatever the best card is around the 500 mark the 3090 will be my first only and last halo tier card except for my old 580 which was like 450 new back in the day
In a perfect world the 4090 should've been priced at 1100 and 4080 16GB priced at 800 Your perfect world sounds worse than what we hade before the silly cheap electircity crypto boom
Considering the absolutely insane increase in performance if 4090 is 1100 it might be even better deal than 1080ti that also mean instead of queuing people and company would be PVPing on the street for new card
Since people buy new iPhones every year for 1000 I have no doubt that 4090's and 4080's will sell like hotcakes even in my not too rich country scalpers scooped up the 4090's and listed them higher people have a lot of money on the sidelines
In a perfect world the 4090 would be 800 and the 4080 would be 600
I mean did they They saw the writing on the wall that no one was going to buy the 12gb at 900 and everyone including tech tubers were already reaming them for it but I don't see what we're gaining here No replacement reprice rename and meanwhile the 4080 16gb is still launching at the same overpriced 1200 judging by their own link to it Well into 4 digit sticker shock entusiasts only price range but with way weaker performance than the 4090 so enthusiasts will just go for 4090 I almost laughed when they act like it has the same appeal of the 4090 So anyways now instead of using a fake name 4080 they officially are just increasing the price of the xx80 series by an insane 500 nearly doubling it from 700 to 1200 MSRP That's terrible The 12 GB is canceled and no word of any replacement If they were going to rename and drastically reduce the price of this 4080 12gb gpu anytime soon they'd likely say so and also have to cut the price of the 4080 16gb to something more reasonable too but they didn't They're just canceling it instead of lowering it so they can avoid the current prices of 3000 series having to lower anymore a lower priced 4070 would ruin current 3000 series prices which nvidia is clearly carefully manipulating So probably there will just be nothing below 1200 this generation till the 3000 series inventory is fully cleared sometime next year at which point they'll release this as the 4070 at less ridiculous price well hopefully lol New gen and new tech DLSS 3 having a 1200 minimum buy in for the forseeable future so they can continue to maintain the current prices of the 3000 series overstock is not listening at all
when they realized they can pull the same artificial stock scarcity with the 4080 the appeared in their eyes Having a cheaper alternative would only fuck with the greed at this point
That depends on if they adjust the price to match because it sure seems like they are going forward with 4080 16GB at current price and 4090 they are claiming is a success
Huge if factual
If I recall AIBs don't even get to know the prices of new cards until the actual announcement
Fuck this PC gaming I got myself a Ps5 Can t wait to play finally games optimized for this hardware without constant troubleshooting and without spending 2000
They'll just say it's the 4070 Ti so the price stands lol That way they can release their super shitty 4070 and keep face while price gouging
They will rename them they won't toss the manufactured cards to the bin But until all that is done and dusted they just saying the thing that is important right now 12GB model won't be launching for now
It ll take time to reprint tens of thousands of boxes and marketing material after they ve even decided what to call it at all It s just unlaunched since they won t be done in time for the release date
Not a good start they should have decreased price on same post but they didnt because these asshole need backslash to get things
No way until they move stockpiles of 3000 cards
Seriously this is a step in the right direction and I lightly applaud Nvidia for not being completely tone deaf but a XX80 card being over 1000 is still madness when just last gen it was 700 msrp and was arguably the best what you get per dollar card
Still too expensive 700 if you go by last gen or 500 going by when prices for video cards were reasonable pre 2000 series
The entire infrastructure of his channel has pretty much evolved to a mix of fantastic journalistic leaks patting himself on the back for his predictions That's not me 'hating' on him either Was always taught if you do any reporting or anything journalistic you NEVER make your material about or involve you just report what your sources say He can't help but to do the opposite Lol That being said I think he and his channel will be just fine
This is exactly why EVGA dumped nvidia because they love pulling stunts like this
Making it worst because the 16gb is not worth what they are asking i rather buy the 4090 if i were to pay alot but because theyre assholes i wont buy any of them i stay with my 3080ti or move to amd f Them
They didn't take enough steps back yet they are still at the top of the slope and theirs a long way for them to yet still fall before they are back on our level Charging 900 for anything less than a XX90Ti class GPU is outright day time robbery
No s needed People complaining literally did it
Right Lol The naming was misleading and they fixed it Now people are just pissy because they want things cheaper person facepalming
The 970 was 329 The 1070 was 379 The 2070 was 499 The 3070 was 499 649 is too much for the 4070
And almost twice the price of the 3080 10gb
Should be a 4070 and the 4080 12gb should be a 4060ti or similar
Yeah that seem ok 760 4080 16gb not brilliant but good enough it is not going happen though
This was my first thought as well AIB's will take a huge loss if they rebrand the card a 4070 and at a lower price
It s not hard at all Their products are incredible and no one can match their performance Loyalty secured
Well there is your problem you chose to be loyal to a large corporation Their only concerns are how much money they can make off of consumers what their shareholders want and how many corners they can cut to continue to make as much money as possible while still beating out the competition This isn't some new development in the corpo world it's been happening for ages
I think it is a different die set and core count so it s realistically more like a 4070 than a 4080
It will probably be decided only when we get to see how AMD will do with their cards They will not cut their price without sizing out the competition first
They're attempting to use the Amber Heard defense v giLphJDxtCE by using confusing synonymously with misleading
Those two have very small differences in performance Performance gap between 4080 12GB and 16GB was massive
Yes sure But the roasting is deserved They admitted HALF of the mistake and barely at that Sure it's confusing should have been honest about the DECEPTION I understand margins are tight but they will have to address price now as well which should have been lock n step originally addressed when they tried to sell us a product like it was a higher tier than it was
Even a 5 year old should be able to click and read the linked article
11 5GB
Selling u a xx70 card at price of xx80 card
The 4080 12GB and 4080 16GB had substantial differences other than the amount of memory basically
IMO a 4070 a 4070ti could be a cut down AD 103
If thats true there will be absolutely no way to hide it Logistics coordinators inventory managers auditors vendor liasons Everyone that is remotely involved in the supply chain would speak out because they would have known that all things to do with 4080 12gb would have been absent from any sort of logistics chain I highly doubt this was planned but if a myriad of people in an assortment of regular every day job positions start posting how the 4080 12gb was mysteriously absent from manufacturing that will be your answer Again I think thats a ridiculous assumption but thats how youd get your proof
4090 Ti is definitely not canned The 4090 is a heavily cut down version of the full die Once they have enough dies they will release it a year down the line
It will be rebranded to 4070 most likely so you need to wait for AIBs to print the stickers to put on the coolers and boxes
Not even ti
What kind of monitor resolution and refresh rate are you gonna be gaming on
30 series card
Get a 3080 12GB for 600
They keep the 40 series cards expensive until all the 30 series stock has been shifted Then magical price drops Just watch 4080 16GB will be around 1000 possibly below it after 30 series overstock is gone
Would have never happened 3090 was 1 5k at launch Rumors are actually that 4090 was supposed to launch at 1900 or 2000 but Jensen cut that down at the last minute Side effect is that 4090 is suddenly the best value out of the ones they have announced so far while at the same time being grossly expensive
Watch the first batch of cards on the streets 40 8 70
My job is done here
You're welcome
We listened to our customers
thanks Steve
As Apple says we think you re gonna love it
Well that's going to have some volume against it perhaps drop at least a 100 Doesn't hurt to ask 900 for a 00x70 yeah that's gonna hurt too much
Oh this will 100 just be the 4070ti later down the road lol
I think it was ment to like 4080 12 gb 4060 4080 16 gb 4070 There is room for a card below the 4090 still
I bet you re right It s gonna be 1070 ti I d wager money
You say current but that is current a year later as the next generation is becoming available Those cards were 1200 2000 when they came out And at that time people were mostly complaining that they couldn't buy enough of them
I predict 4070 launches at 600 650 and 4070ti at 700 750 at CES
They'll call it 4090Ti 20 Edition
Well they raised the price of the 80 class don't expect 70 class to be any different than what the 4080 12GB is
Disagree I would way rather them just own what they are doing and name it the 4070 at 900 then keep the confusing name Now obviously I hope they lower the price But this is better than leaving it as is It will result in less confused people buying something they didn t intend to Not everyone is in the loop
It s not a 4060 Lol
More a 4030
They're already changing the name so that the differing amount of cores and memory are associated with a different model number What possible standard is there that says this card should be called a 4060 Answer there isn't There is no specification out there at all it has always been arbitrary and that card now has its own distinct model number There's zero problem calling it a 4070 in the current lineup yet y'all still find a way to complain even after they essentially reduced the price for 3090 Ti performance by over half less than a year since it launched I'm tired of it nothing's ever good enough
I wouldn't even say it's a 4060 Ti at least the 3060 Ti had a 256 bit memory bus Yes the memory bandwidth was a little more but this is more like a 3060 in terms of setup and configuration the memory's speed was what gave it more of the boost in bandwidth
It is not a 4060ti
remindme 3 months
550 probably for me for the 4080 12gb Doubt that would happen though
Gamers Nexus says they already recalling or recycling boxes and that nVidia is helping with the process So maybe full reprints
E 't believe this is actually real
The 4090 is genuinely an amazing card And while the other cards are significantly slower they would also have been great had they been priced accordingly But they weren't They are ridiculously overpriced As a result only the 4090 looks like a good deal relatively speaking The 4080 16GB is still terrible value and you should never buy it NVIDIA once again shooting themselves in the foot by ruining an otherwise great generation with idiotic pricing and tiering of their cards If the 4080 16GB is way slower than the 4090 then that should be reflected in the price They can take that 1200 MSRP and shove it
I was hoping they would cancel the 4080 16GB price too To be honest the 4080 16GB at times is way worse than the 4090 not to mention it's not much faster than the 3090 Ti at times either Look at those Plague's Tale slides NVIDIA released The gap was almost double between the 4090 and 4080 Honestly NVIDIA should just backtrack now and price cut the 4080 16GB to 699 They'd get so much good PR from the move and it would return pricing to some semblance of normality 40 series might actually be obtainable for people too Imagine if they get lots of 4080 16GB cards into people's hands it'll accelerate RT even more and give AMD almost no opening into the market for market share But right now NVIDIA's leaving the door right on open for AMD to swoop in with some 7800 XT at 699 that gets like 80 of the 4090's performance NVIDIA's done a good thing by doing this cancellation of the most stupid naming for a mid range SKU imaginable now they just have to fix pricing I think the 4090 can remain a halo product at 1699 so long as they maintain the performance lead over AMD
I suspect that the 4080 12G performance wouldn't beat the 3090Ti Which would be deeply embarrassing and all the reviewers would blast it and tell people to get a used 3090Ti which is often selling today for 900 A 900 card that doesn't beat the last generation 900 card would have just been dead on arrival It would actually make more sense to reduce the price of the 3090 Ti to 900 and scale the 3000 series accordingly It would sell a glut of Ampere stock And the whole price performance ratios would make sense across the lineup for Nvidia And the AIB's will be screwed once again Maybe Asus can leave the market next and then maybe Nvidia might actually care to clean up their act but I doubt it
I dont doubt AMD will fleece us as well but I hope they do stick it to nvidia
Is with ease Jumping away
That's like speculating that the 6800xt will for sure beat the 3070 back in 2020 lol
I hope they're not as competitive current gen GPU's are good enough just bring down the prices with lower wattage and I'm fine
Lol you are fucking out of your mind if you think they have a 4080 16GB competitor AMD is probably 2 generations behind Nvidia They will with a shadow of a doubt not have a competitor for the 4080 16GB
they will beat this 12gb one with easy I mean 6950XT is a 4080 12gb comp already basically 4080 12gb by Nvidias own numbers its a 3090
Sounds like it I think Nvidia is also starting to get a little nervous now that they aren t making the same profits as they did during the shortage A ton of people have been very vocal about wanting strong competition against them
The 4090 is more accurately called a 4080 24GB yeah The 4080 16GB is actually the 4070 16GB The 4080 12GB is actually the 4060 12GB
Plausible for rasterization Less so for raytracing
It was be as easy as naming one 4080 16gb and the other 4080 12gb
They are the same person
Dominated Barely and for hundreds of extra dollars you get what 5 more performance Look up 6950 xt vs 3090 ti Fact check yourself
Did you really just post a clickbait article based on pure speculation and rumors that said to take the article with a grain of salt as definitive proof L M A O bruh
The 6900xt was a pretty dang good card for the price They haven't ridiculed anyone yet but the gap is closing
The prices were close for years 2070 super vs 5700 xt 2060 super vs 5700 6800 xt vs 3080 6800 vs 3070 6700 xt 6600 xt vs 3060 ti They were always within 100 100 to get the more premium software was worth it for the purchaser Now Nvidia raised the price of their 80 series 70 It's going to be a 7800 xt at 700 vs a 4080 at 1200 Maybe all the way down the stack If that is reality people would be plain stupid to not buy the significantly cheaper card That's the thing with charts history It doesn't matter when a humongous change takes place If nothing changed those charts would hold true But there will be a reaction to the change if nvidia maintains these prices
alleged rumour
They already compete with the 4080 12gb my guy 4080 12gb is around 3080 ti level and amd has at least 3 cards around that level already
They saw the writing on the wall and knew exactly what they were doing
Theyre so big because Nvidia forgot they were going in PC cases not open mining rigs
The sizes of those things are unreal My 3090 FTW3 Ultra was already rivaling the height of my Xbox Series X I can't believe the cards have gotten even bigger
Yea EVGA got out just in time for this train wreck to leave the tracks
Nvidia will send AIBs vaseline to make it easier
alot of coolers have '4080' molded into them lmao
Hey at least Nvidia has the courtesy to make the 4080 font thinner so it costs less to replace s
Are they thin They go and charge at times hundreds of dollars more for certain models that most definitely didn't cost them the same to build Having a 699 3080 that ends up being like 850 or more seems like a good thing
I was thinking of exactly this good on EVGA for having the balls to tell nvidia to piss off
Maybe nvidia is purposely trying to drive AiB out of business and just start distributing all gpus themselves It would increase their profits The reason why they don't just cut everyone off is they don't have the infrastructure to build that many gpus at this moment in time
Evga had also their problems
Eh if the AIB care so much maybe they should make their own GPUs Oh wait they can't just resell cards someone else makes
The AIB's do make me wonder about something to be more specific the price We know the margins are small we know they have 4080 s already completely ready and that they probably paid a specific price while targeting the 4080 MSRP So my question is would Nvidia further screw them slapping a price cut of it or would they launch a GPU title 4070 at that price
Nvidia is so confusing to me right now do they want board partners or not On one hand they treat them like shit and make it really difficult to have any margin which makes me think they want to get rid of partners and on the other hand they never have enough supply of FE cards and make stupid design choices like the location of the power cable and needing that adapter
Almost like this was planned all along
EVGA with the pro level dodge
They cant make more 4090 without buying more lower end dys since they get bundled so nvdia has them completly under controll they could only go further in debt
This is the actual answer
Sure but if enough of them drop Nvidia or go bust then consumers will have far fewer options in the future
so that implies the 4060 would be a 700 750 part leaving a 4050 still around 500 Or keep selling 1630 1650 3050 3050 Ti but just even rebrand again
They will absolutely relaunch it as a 4070 Although i think they will give in and lower the price for like 100 What this does though is leave them in a pretty stupid position where their only xx80 class card is debuting at fucking 1200 That even with inflation is 50 100 more than any xx80 card in the past lmao
Aside from the PR spanking they got about the naming the main issue is that they have waaaayyyyy too many RTX 3000 unsold in the retail channels As expensive as it was this 4080 4070 would have eaten in the sales of the 3080's That last move probably made the retailers VERY happy
Exactly They really think we are suckers The card is already in production It's not being unlaunched just relaunched and rebranded They insulted the base and instead of apologizing doubling down on the shameless marketing
Does anyone know an Nvidia reddit rep we can tag This is not right Make this publicly known Nvidia especially should have higher standards
Send them a take down notice or ask for free merch
Look like someone is gonna get a 4090ti on Nvidia's dime lol but to be honest ask demand payment and make sure to be firm Nvidia has stolen art and altered in the past without compensation and has been completely unrepentant about it
Screams of really trying to push the apple vibe Which makes it kinda funny when it's a line of about 50 people
I think that what is kinda cringe about it is this basically sounds like them saying hey we fucked up but let s ignore that look at how well the 4090 is doing
Say that to the Europeans where a 4090 costs 2 500
The 3090 was overpriced from Day 1 Do people really have such short memories that they forgot this was the number 1 complaint about the 3090 when compared to 3080 It was 5 performance for 100 money The only reason it sold was if you needed the VRAM for content creation or mining
The 4090 really is a solid card and still has better frames dollar than the 3090 Only in the US though and even then it's a bit of a stretch Elsewhere it's at least 2 000 dollars Which is not a realistic pricing however you want to put it The problem is that nVidia has a de facto monopoly in the high end AMD has a decent offering but it's not at the level of what nVidia has So they can pretty much do what they want with the prices Like doubling them because why not
Eh I don't really think the pics are cringe The 4090 really is a solid card and still has better frames dollar than the 3090 Only because the 3090 was garbage that only sold because of miners And of course it's going to be the 4070 Best case they'll take 100 off but it's still outrageous
to be honest I feel the 3090 was and is still overpriced they just managed to make us think its the norm when their gross profit margins on gpus are like 60 which is like a 150 markup
Queuing for hours to buy a card that you can buy online and with a price tag that asures that it won't sold out is a little bit cringe I don't know how is the situation in USA but at least in Europe there is plenty of stock of all the 4090 models none of them has sold out
lol the new halo card is really better than the old halo card Fucking hell
4ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollow What if they keep the Cuda core configuration exactly the same as the 4080 16gb model and just reduce the memory bandwidth An actual 4080 12GB Sure it will be limited by its memory bus But we are looking at at most 5 to 10 decrease in performance for 899 Would be a decent card
IMO it's only the right thing if they reduce the price alongside the rename It was obvious this was originally going to be a 4070 and 900 for a 4070 that is reportedly slightly slower than a 3090ti which is going for around 1k is still a horrible deal when it comes to the price to performance change for a new generation If Nvidia doesn't lower the price then this is nothing more than trying to save face before they get horrendous reviews for this card specifically
Nvidia responded to the criticism by doing the right thing Props in other words We got caught trying to scam our customers with a fake naming scheme so we discontinue said scam product now thank us
This wasn't responding to criticism It was realizing that a 4070 branded as a 4080 would potentially cut into actual 4080 sales among consumers who didn't know better Or they got wind of AMD's potential pricing strategy this gen and went back to the drawing board
they have anti scalping program now but during mining crisis and 30 release they somehow couldn't do
Nvidia Verified Program hasn't verified shit A handful of people were graced with the honor to give them 1600 dollars There are also PLENTY of people who have GFE with FE cards who got skipped over
verified gamers program you mean 'better and worse gamers' Why on Earth FEs can be shipped to Germany or Netherlands and not to all EU countries like Poland or Ireland among many others I live literally 200km from german border I could even drive and pick it up but pickups are banned for FEs now same as automated parcel lockers because my countrymen dared to try and bypass a geoblock in Ampere era by ordering to a locker at the border and driving trough the whole country to get their card This is against EU laws btw you can have exorbitant shipping fees in your online store but you can't discriminate EU citizens based on their geographical location In the same reality Proshop in Denmark says 'logistics centers go ' and ships me an AiB card over 3 borders and 1500km like nothing happened
Def didn't do the right thing
And yet people here are still whining that this should actually be called a 4060 somehow I hate Reddit sometimes
I think that's been the message We can make and sell our own cards anyway so play our game how we want or you just don't play any more
Well That would be fun Nvidia would loose a lot of market share world wide I have never seen a Nvidia reference GPU on sale on my country online or retail Nvidia doesn't sell reference cards to my country either only redirect to only stores that don't have reference cards too I don't know Nvidia plans to sell the cards without AIB world wide Maybe second handed or through Ebay that how I got my GTX 1080 TI FE
In retrospect I'm still waiting for them to announce a partnership with AMD Intel if it was really all about Nvidia
EVGA must be laughing right now
Holy shit you're right That's even scummier that Nvidia conveniently doesn't have to deal with their own stock
LOL Nvidia knew this was going to be a risky one Likely they had this 'unlaunch' option in mind
not as 4080 12g tough Nvidia won't allow that Some poor soul is going to replace bunch of Serial number and type stickers on bunch of cards And maybe boxes And maybe reflash VBIOSes since PCI id is already reserved for 4080 and bios contains type strings as well and those show up in tools like GPUz
One must be celebrating
Same in the uk for ok ish 50 increase what they charging its piss poor
They will They always do
I'm so happy of our community not putting up with Nvidia's bullshit on this one You mean the community that is happy Nvidia changed a number on the box It's still priced at 900 lol
Yeah the 4090 is actually a good card The 90 class basically replaced the titan series and titan cards were always expensive But there was never a time where they charged 1200 for an 80 class GPU I planned on getting the 4080 thinking there would be an increase of price to around 800 but 1200 is too damn much probably gonna end up with a 4070 unfortunately Wish I didn't have a gsync monitor so I can consider what AMD is offering loudly crying face
Good for them Not for us If people actually buy the the 4080 16gb for 1200 in large volume then I guess that's what the 80 class GPUs will be priced at moving forward
Give me a leather jacket and a label machine and I'll do it in 12 hours in my kitchen
It's okay I can make you feel better I bought a 1 200 3060 in December because I built my first computer Then I bought a 900 3070ti when I hit the Shuffle because I was underwhelmed with my 3060 Now I just bought a 4090 Feel better
GTX 1080 launched at 600
Capitalism's grow forever at any cost makes this impossible
Or hear me out Go back to 500 for the 80 series like 1080 This mentality shows how Nvidia normalized insane pricing with their 2000 3000 series If people are willing to buy a product for 900 it would be just stupid for Nvidia or any other company to sell it for 500
Seems great in theory and all but why would they reduce the price when their entire stock immediately sells out at the inflated prices they've already set Don't get me wrong I'd love a 4080 for 500 bucks but no company on earth would cut their prices in half when they'll still sell out at double the price Supply and command your product is worth what people are willing to pay and there are enough people willing to pay their prices unfortunately
The 1080 launched at 599 not 500 Also 599 in 2016 is equivalent to 704 today The 3080 was launched at 699 which was a comparable price They should have stuck with that
Go back to 500 for the 80 series like 1080 They'd lose money at that price TSMC 4N ain't cheap There is such a large gap between the 4080 and 4090 they are clearly setting up a strong 4080ti Which means with their current pricing the ti will be significantly faster for not much more Nvidia was explicit about their pricing strategy in investor calls They are pricing 40 series higher to clear the channel of 30 series After the old stock has sold through you should expect a lineup refresh that moves prices down to sensible buying levels
RTX3080 launched at 699
The silicon itself from TSMC costs more than that No you don t get free hardware
They didn't normalize anything crazy fuckers who buy them are normalizing it
700 750 would be paletable for the fe nvidia still make a 100 profit that would not be great but an acceptable increase
I agree nvidia are shafting people but of course a lot americans think corporations are their friends and will pay whatever increasing prices for those of us in the rest of world that have common sense and logic and dont enjoy being bent over by Jensen
Go back to 500 for the 80 series like 1080 I wish this was still realistic but if you look at perf it's been barely moving in the last 5 years and people are clearly willing to pay so let them pay I will keep to rule in my flair
This so much
The 4090 ti will be 1999 Thats 25 more The 4090 will still have a place
They re selling out Absolutely no reason they should or would make them 500
Don't buy it at 900 it still looks like shit Look at charts without any type of dlss 3 and they have almost the same preformance as the 3080 90 x200B Kinda seems like the 12GB is a 4060 TI and the 16gb is a 4070 TI
Oh absolutely We ll be seeing a 4070ti for the same price in a few months But at least we won t have a confusing as shit naming structure I wonder if they got a lot of backlash from vendors who anticipated an abnormally high return rate from people accidentally buying the wrong card in a rush to get one that s in stock
It's still a 4060 in relation to the 4090 not a 4070
Oh they definitely won t It ll be a 4070 Ti in 3 months
That's exactly why they only gave 8GB of VRAM to 3070 planned
This person says they did not
They will If everyone reads the statement Nvidia was careful not to actually apologize They just said it caused confusion High chance it still launches at 899
Even if the pricing is the same it is still a win for the consumer as it is was basically fake marketing to call it 4080 If it is branded as 4070 even non tech news followers can immediately understand it is a lower end card than 4080 16gb Price is entirely another debate
Happened before Remember that 3080 20GB that was canceled at the last minute and leakers claimed AIB's were furious Later those 20GB 3080's started showing up in China on the used market they were clearly already being made Same was true for that specific GA102 chip that was going to be used in the 3080 Ti but they changed the spec at the last minute which required them to laser a line through the old name of the chip on the silicon itself something which you very rarely see I believe it was supposed to be a 20GB 3080 Ti some of them ended up on the Russian market so once again they did enter production but were subsequently canceled
Maybe contact them and charge them money for using your image
jensen owes u a 4090 now
If you put it on Reddit its free for anyone to take Read Reddit's terms of use
Just out of curiosity which image was it
Agreed If they could get DLSS3 to work without game specific support then it'd be the greatest generational leap ever but with barely any games supporting it this gen feels crap
Honestly They really should have Just call the 4090 the Titan or some shit Keep it at its current price And continue to run the 30 series This is not an upgrade generation But half of this sub will still upgrade from their 3080TI to a 4080 for the 5 fps and the 3 games that will use DLSS3 0
Or you know people stop buying at absurd prices
Wut
4080 12TB lol remindme 10 years
They'll probably keep the 900 price tag Expect the 5070 to be 4 figs
Interesting strategy if they rename the 4080 12gb to 3070 Lol
1650 Ti Super Extra Platinum Dragon Edition X
Nobody is buying a 4080 at 1200 They will rot on shelves
The latter
Not defending Nvidia by any means regarding the 4080 but I camped out for stuff all the time growing up Xbox Switch etc I had a job and life so it s totally doable although you do sacrifice taking leave if you work which is questionable lol
students people who take PTO scalpers
People able to buy one probably could have weathered a loss of pay for one to two days
We used to camp out for Black Friday when stores like Fry's Electronics opened their doors at 5am with actual amazing deals The weather was cool we brought a tent and it was overall hanging out with good company and having good times playing cards board games chatting about life eating junk food etc It was tradition
How can 3080 performance tier card the 4070 12gb cost more than 't get the point that value should increase Gen over Gen 3080 is 2 years old card and its msrp is 699 For there to be any reason for people to get 4070 12gb it's actually xx60ti die size it needs to be less than 699 Do not look at dlss 3 0 FG numbers those are inflated fake fps not indicator of performance only dlss 2 0 and native Going by last decade we got xx80 tier perforamnce from last gen for mid range prices of last Gen So 3080 tier card the 4070 12gb 60Ti should been around 3060ti and 4070 pricing LIKE IT HAS BEEN FOR LAST DECADE People got so focused on schematics they are not paying attention to main issue value regression first time ever in nvidia history
12GB was supposed to be an all AIB card So Nvidia doesn't itself have a ton of pulled back FE's now in hand but the AIB's do It will be interesting to see how they are going to mitigate this
They'll certainly use what was the 4080 12gb as something whether it's a 4070 or 4070 Ti 4080 16gb is still a joke maybe at like 1000 it's worth considering
They saw the writing on the wall that no one was going to buy the 12gb at 900 You put way too much faith in consumers Believe it or not there are people who love PC gaming and the high end experience who don't want to spend hours browsing forums for the most hyper optimizing build The 4080 was going to sell but not to the informed So they did listen This change will negatively affect Nvidia but benefit consumers
In the uk and europe its 95 more expensive
Thank God my 3070 is gonna be just fine for the foreseeable future Hell my SO has a 1080p rig and she's doing fine with a GTX1080 still These prices are just insane though I can't imagine spending this much money on a GPU just to game I'd have to be doing ML stuff or something lol
The gain I see is that we no longer have the confusion of 2 different 4080 cards with completely different performance They will still be expensive so if you want faster for cheaper you'll have to wait
It's still a win for consumers even if they don't adjust price Labeling it a 4070 rather than 4080 will lead to a lot of people not getting tricked Tons of people would just see 4080 and would think they're getting one when it's really not Now they'll know it's a 4070 and maybe not buy at MSRP
Infinite if fractal
Large if real
Both the naming and the pricing was criticized for the 4080 cards Increasing MSRP by 70 80 from the 30 series equivalent tier is pretty insane Not to mention that the performance isn't anything special anyway the 4090 is way more powerful relatively than the 3090 was to the 3080 3070
Agreed Good enough especially with recent global markets and the cost of new manufacturing nodes I can understand some rational increase The current model is atrocious though
The cost involved in this will clearly push the already boxed cards into the red then now having to sort graphics etc out before launch yikes
If MSRP drops along with the rename NV will definitely refund part of the material costs to the AIB They most likely also get to pay for the new boxes Of course we technically do not know if the price also
No doubt their product is the best For them to pull them out is at least a step to the right path but imagine you buying a gpu labeled 3080 but performs like a 3070 wont that hurt If no one called them out about it it will be the case but for 40series
If i sold you a corolla with the emblem of rolls royce and for the same amount of a rolls royce would you buy again from me Numbers don t lie
Honesty is what i was expecting from nvidia they could triple the price and it would still be sold out Even I would buy it honestly But they tried to pull a move that wasn t right they unlaunched it meaning that consumers has the last say
lol You've never worked anywhere near anything marketing or management have you
Ah I read a couple places that said they had to shelve it from release Seems other stories say this is just temporary until they sort out the issue It s definitely delayed and currently problematic though it seems
Cheapest new is 830 And used is 700 lol Where the hell are you guys getting such low prices I aim to hit 1440p 144hz and upgrade to 4k in 2 years time
Sticker on the box
4075
Ah yes the forty thousand series starting at 9 000
I forgot they actually did that for the 30 series Rebranded chips and crossed out the old name lol
Yeah they'll for sure name it the 4070 ti so that they can either not drop the price at all or at most drop it by 100
Don't kid yourself Full xx104 die has never been xx60 which is typically xx106 range I'm all for calling Nvidia out on their positioning bullshit but asking for full AD104 GDDR6X on the 4060 is not a good faith ask
Not if you watch the youtube reviewers They are saying the 4080 looks great at 1200
That's not relevant in the slightest I'm talking about the current market conditions and the current market conditions are that any 900 card will have to compete with 3090 and 3090 Ti's available at or near that price
I fully expect the 70 class to be this exact 80 class 12GB GPU But that s only doing half the work if NVIDIA wants to change public perception in a positive direction Without a price reduction this just seems like they announced a price increase for their unannounced 70 class GPU
I agree but TBF it's still misleading This card is a 4060 class at least it feels like it to me and it's priced like almost 4090 of yore That is the 1080 Ti was priced at 699 and 1080 was 599 at launch Now I know we had some inflation in the last 5 6 years bit it ain't more than 2x Heck I bought my 1070 for 400
If the card stays priced at 900 then it doesn't matter what they call it If you increase the price of a category by 80 then it's not the same category anymore
Agreed and I 's still a better deal than buying a similarly priced Ampere card so I don't see why people are so outraged at the price increases Even the 3090 Ti which the 4080 12GB 4070 would be 9x 2x as performant as was more than double the price at launch Price per dollar is still better even if it's not as great as it used to be each generation But raw performance is just plainly getting harder to develop every generation so we're going to have to get used to more modest perf gains
Than
Though I don't really know why they didn't call it the 4080 ti and 4080 Were they expecting a warmer welcome or something
It is
What possible standard is there that says this card should be called a 4060 Answer there isn't There is Since at least 10xx series the 192 bit memory interface has been a xx60 card It's odd that they moved that up all the way to 4080 Even my aging 1070 has a wider memory interface There's zero problem calling it a 4070 in the current lineup yet y'all still find a way to complain even after they essentially reduced the price for 3090 Ti performance by over half less than a year since it launched That just means it was massively overpriced to begin with
Keep in mind AMD drastically increased the cache with RDNA2 with the introduction of Infinity Cache which allowed them to reduce the bus width Nvidia is going from 6MB of L2 to 72MB on their top end cards
thinking face Ok 're watching this Get to it
This isn't a great generation The only card that deserves to be called great is the 4090 where even if you exclude DLSS 3 0 you're still getting performance close to 2 times better than the previous flagship The 4080 16GB is barely faster than the 3090 ti
Good deal in the US only Everywhere else it is extremely overpriced
800USD MSRP band wagon all aboard
Yea good deal riiiight I mean it does what it says but factor in the power consumption size of the card etc This page screams ugh fine ungrateful 4080 bitches why can't you be more like the 4090 simps Get fucked Nvidia
How is it a good deal though Isn t it twice the price of a 3090 but twice as fast They sold the equivalent of 2 sli cards without the sli
The 4090 is genuinely an amazing card Is it thought It's significantly larger than any modern laptop and even larger than some desktop PCs these days While it's powerful at that size it almost seems like cop out What's next double the size and power consumption again
Whelp guess I'll have to keep on waiting for a card I guess
nVidia could very well delay the 4000 series to give more room to the 3000 because honestly very few need the 4090 power but investors wouldn't like that
The 4080 16GB is still terrible value and you should never buy it Yet it will be sold out everywere and they know that
I've seen youtubers state the 4080 is going to be well received at 1200 lol
4090 IS truly amazing it requires installation of a small nuclear reactor in the house
Yeah the flagship has usually never been the best price performance but we're in crazy town now
Meanwhile they'll sell out of cards to people who can't afford them and continue the bs
I really took for granted how good Nvidia was at price tiering cards for so many years until they weren t anymore
the 4080 16GB should've been the price of the 4080 12GB maybe even less then I would've bought it without hesitation
Why is everyone saying that before the independent benchmarks The few released show is 20 30 slower than the 4090 and a 400 savings The 16gb will be useful for DLSS3 Haters will hate but this whole terrible value when nvidias own benchmark show the 4080 crushing 3090ti is just eye rolling
People saying performane of 4090 is amazing and I'm looking at a card that would bring my PC to over 1kw an hour in power Using 7 cents an hour playing a game is not my idea of amazing
But right now NVIDIA's leaving the door right on open for AMD to swoop in with some 7800 XT at 699 that gets like 80 of the 4090's performance God that would be so fucking cool I would give up DLSS and go team red if they drop a big dookie on Nvidia by undercutting them that hard
That would be great but it is not going to happen The reason why is too many fanboys just buy at whatever price not thinking critically about the effect it will have in the next gen also Nvidia still thinking were in a crypto boom and its a pandemic As customers we have a lot of power all it takes is alot of people saying to themselves hang on a minute this piss poor value why i letting corporations rip me off i am not paying that they can sit the shelves the 80s series etc and I will not pay scalpers Apparently nowadays that takes someone a lot of will power lool
do those graphs include the ai generated frames
Cut 4080 to 699 What part of we have a giant warehouse full of 30 series we have to get rid of first do you not understand
There's no benefit for Nvidia to price out AMD They are duopoly and they count on their competitor's existence to avoid anti monopoly investigations
im not native english speaker so bare with meface with peeking eye im from austria
The cheapest 6800xt Description 6800xt cm re 6800xt 14 932 381 Product on newegg is the same price as the cheapest 3070 Description 3070 cm re 3070 14 932 450 Product quicklink true so not a bad comparison lol
i know i dont know why anyone would think that even the 6950xt will beat that 12gb card in raster games not in all tho
that makes no sense competition brings lower prices
given the fact that the 3090ti is around 10 faster than the 6950xt depending on the game and the 4080 12g is slower than the 3090ti its pretty obvious that anything amd launches as top of the line will fight if not win the 4080 16gb although i doubt any card from this generation will come close the the 4090 if we dont count the 4090ti
Why not Last gen they had a flagship competitor the 6900 XT I see no reason why it will be any different this gen
Lol thank you for a good laugh fanboy
AMD is probably 2 generations behind Nvidia If so you probably have to pay 2199 for 4090 instead of 1599
They have 50 more at 300Watts They are alteady there Pump that up to 400 or more and they are in striking distance to the 4090 in rasterization Rdna is a pure Gaming Chip Look how small the die of the 6600 is and its close to the 3060 in speed Nvidia only has Raytracing Dlss3 is a joke so far They brought up this strange dlss because they know And is close You think Nvidia goes all in if not They never did when amd was far back Turing Was a joke because and only competed with a 2070super at best Bit rdna2 is head on head with ampere in rasterization person shrugging light skin tone You will wonder if you think they cant beat the lousy 4080 Youll see why they bring the 4080ti and 4090ti Nvidia never changes Theres a reason the gap is so huge from the 80 to 90 card this time Ampere it was the same chip and at best 15 difference from 3080 to 3090 Ill say they will kick ass in rasterization with Raytracing will be interesting hope they beat ampere by a good margin But thats nvidias last card their RT performance people also thought rdna2 will only compete with the 3070 lol yet its head on with the 3090 at a much lower price
oh look at butthurt downvotes Come on people He meant feature wise its true Cuda DLSS raytracing and more many people want to claim that those features are just gimmicks but they are not People pay for stable software features performance AMD is still behind at least 2 generations in this case This is why they are charging Premium bucks about AMD why do you think they are trying to fight by keeping MSRP low they want to help customers hell no why do you think intel GPUs are priced the way they are lower than AMD and Nvidia Same goes for AMD cpus they did really great job at 5000 series cpus So they increased the price 6 cores for 300 hint charging premium Some people are rooting for these companies like they are some sports team Grow up Whoever gives better combination of those 3 will take the money Software features Performance Lets wait for 4060 and 4060Ti 3060 was really awesome AMD shines in Linux thats great i hope linux gaming will becomes popular Mighty Microsoft is almost a monopoly in gaming welll HDR support meh hope situation improves in linux camp
which means 3080 3080ti depends on game
They all cost more than a 3090 though right
Because the sheep all bought into NVIDIA's bullshit 780 top card on release 980 top card on release 1080 top card on release pricing all reasonable 2080ti rebaged 2080 top card on release 3090 top card on release 4090 top card on release pricing all absurd because 'they're not an 80 card' All they did was change the naming and quadruple prices and everyone fell for it x200B Difference is now we'll get a 4090 and 4090ti vs a 1080 and a 1080ti
When you look at die definitely See
Yeah I don t think anyone expects them to be better at RT than Nvidia
Steam charts are dominated by Nvidia GPUs still Have you seen steam charts Nvidia has a 76 77 market share AMD has 14 41
Nope I posted a rumor People are super emotional in this thread so much strawmanning
And will bundle free sand with the vaseline
Nvidia will send sell AIBs vaseline to make it easier
Yes they are thin I don't know how thin but I know they are frequently cited as thin which is why the companies that make GPU's usually have their hands in many other 's biggest GPU first manufacture stop making GPUs AIBs have criticized Nvidia for their FE models Nvidia can make their boards much cheaper because they are making the GPUs and have access to them long before AIBs allowing them to design reference boards alongside the GPU itself and AIBs are expected to compete with them especially with their entry tier cards despite being more expensive to produce The premium models may fetch higher price tags but those models obviously come with additional costs as well Those skus come with additional R D cost and beefed up boards and coolers that are more expensive to make often tighter binning processes that take up resources etc This all costs money while Nvidia only has to focus on one SKU They might make better margins on the higher tier cards but I still doubt they are great It's sort of a slap in the face when the company you rely on for GPUs is also the hardest company to compete with because they can make their FE cards much more efficiently If we had access to what Nvidia makes off a 699 FE 3080 vs what AIBs make off their entry level 699 3080s you can be sure the former makes a lot more All this made worse by the fact that these products do not mature You put all the work into R D for a card has roughly a 1 5 year shelf life maybe 2 if conditions are favorable and then it's old shit and you're starting over to design something new And if Nvidia throws you a curve ball you suck it up and deal with it to keep your products on the market a la the 20 series supers or unlaunching a product well after you've started manufacturing it Everything I've heard about being in the GPU business it sounds like most companies do it more as a brand strengthening thing than they do for raw profit dollars MSI Gigabit and Asus may not make a ton of money when you buy their GPU but the hope is that if you buy and like their GPU you may also buy their motherboards PSUs peripherals and whatever else they make out of brand loyalty Which again is why we just saw the really big GPU first company bow out of the market Obviously things weren't trending in the right direction for sustainability over at Evga
Pretty that jenson guy said that is their endgame To become the 'apple of GPUs' 100 self reliant from production to the consumer They see AIBs as worthless leeches on profits
That's a remarkably flawed way of thinking They aren't reselling a card someone else makes They are taking a GPU someone else made and putting it onto a board they made They are entirely different things Should they also be making their own CPU's instead of slotting motherboards for AMD and Intel products Making their own ram instead of using DDR Hell why stop there they should start manufacturing memory chips instead of getting them from the likes of Micron and Hynix right And jumping into the semiconductor game Next up Asus' very own fab ammirite The entire PC components industry relies on a huge number of companies focusing on manufacturing specialized components so that other companies can come along and put them all together on a finished product That's how all of this works To suggest that this is a shortcoming is an asinine misunderstanding of how PC components work
NVIDIA should stop using TSMC and Samsung foundries and make their own Oh wait they can't just resell silicon someone else makes
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge Nvidia
Imagine how board partners feel about this I mean some of them have to have already made cards nVidia isn't going to compensate them They will have to eat it and rename the cards 4070 and take the loss
It feels like as if they knew that it'd happen that they'd unlaunch 4080 12GB even before it was launched as if it was predermined to make NVIDIA sound like a good guy
The 30 series cards are going to be with us for another couple years so I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a 4060 or 4050 anytime soon
Most likely what they will do is drop a 4080Ti at 1200 and move the 4080 16 gig down a few hundred dollars if it doesn't sell well enough for them
They can adjust as they get rid of the high end 3000 stock and see what AMD puts out
I wouldn't expect them to relaunch it as 4070 without any change If they drop the price they will put in some cost saving measures like GDDR6 memory instead of GDDR6X
Even that is too much I think 600 is the most they could get away with which is a 100 increase over the previous 500
Even then the 4080 16gb looks like shit It really seems like the 12GB is a 4060 TI and 16GB is a 4070 ti
I get the feeling that for a 4070 rebranding they will probably cut the ram to 10GB too
They saw the scalpers were getting and they wanted in on the mega profit
Lower the price by like 100
I agree But they've probably already started making 4070s What are they gonna do with those Make them 4060s And on down the stack
If they want to move the 30 series they are going to have to bring DLSS to them In fact those are the cards that need it Clearly the 4090 gets close to 4K 120 without frame generation and the display port 1 4 output can't feed a higher refresh monitor higher than that anyway They limited the frame generation feature to the cards that will need it the least
MC staff will get special stickers to change the 8 to a 7
What you want them to waste perfectly good GPUs because the marketing department screwed up and named them wrong Obviously they're going to be rebranded lol they're valuable chips that's not doubling down that's just the only possible option
More like we were a bit worried so we tried to hide the 4070 but seeing as how people lined up to buy a 1600 card we are now sure it would have sold gangbusters anyway so we don't need to confuse consumers anymore That's the vibe I got from these images being in the article
For sure a bit but there were a LOT of people that were saying that the 4090 was DOA and that nobody is going to buy it I don't really blame Nvidia for putting those pics in this post
Look how good value a 4090 is in gaming compared to 3090 But the 3090 was shit value in gaming 3090 was Titan card for creators it wasn't for gamers
They're mostly all sold out in USA and Canada
Dude what blew my mind is that there is a ebay scalper that upsold 26 yesterday im not that surprised but seems nuts they were able to buy soo many in the first wave shouldn't their be limits in place FFS
I saw a benchmark that showed it to be only 10 faster then a 3080 without dlss is that wrong
Calling it a 4080 with a high price is much more palatable than a 4070 with the same high price I highly doubt this doesn't come with a price drop when it is re announced
Slightly they've essentially reduced the price of that level of performance by more than half in less than a year I think the price is fine What they do need to do IMO is keep adding models below that Maybe a 4050 and even a 4040 that reach into the low hundreds for price to still cover that level of gaming
People can whine online but the market decides what the cards are worth Ultimately everyone always wants everything for cheaper but that doesn't mean the existence of an expensive thing is morally wrong Imo the only wrongdoing by Nvidia here was the misleading naming which went against GPU conventions
laughed way too hard at this comment lmao
I mean if we're going to bash the company even when it does the right
Some people just live to hate person shrugging
It s a companies job to maximize profits and the customers job to keep companies honest We should give them props walking it back because let s be honest unless RDNA 3 brings something genuinely competitive Nvidia is in the market position to blow consumers off at next to no consequence It pisses me off as well to celebrate a company walking back scummy labeling practices but you have to praise behavior you want to continue
People who didn't know better would buy the lower priced 4080 thinking is actually a 4080 This would increase 4080 sales not reduce them
It should be called a 4060 and it should cost 200 because my feels tell me so
If what they're planning is to then subcontract these former AIBs to make their cards they're going to have a nasty surprise coming
Told ya fuckers and none of y all listened puts on sunglasses and smiles
Sounds like they have their work cut out for them But if they do it right it will be the smoothest unlaunch ever
Everytime I get my hopes up with AMD all I get is regret pain and sadness Not getting my hopes up this time
Damn dude You beat me to it I was also building my first PC when I bought the RTX 3070 ti The RTX 3080 back then cost around 1800 2000 where I m from The 4090 right now in my country is between 2000 2500
Yea and the partner models weren't cheap The original receipt when I bought my used ftw3 had a price of 800 so 645 without tax or 710 with 2016 conversion
It s true I try to explain it to my friends every now and again to how this problem in late stage capitalism is really a problem If a company make 10million and the next year they make 11 million That s a 10 growth But if the next year they make 12 1million it s another 10 growth but it s seen as a failure You need your growth to continue and not remain stagnant So that s why companies go for 20 then 30 but then there is market problems where they ve reached peak consumer levels and blah blah blah Then we get into the big problem we have nowadays where companies are too big to fail so they have no consequences for their failures and get bailed out so new companies can t enter the market cause the giants never fall Wow talk about a rant from me haha
I mean I see this response a lot and it s not wrong The problem is the consumer but that is an issue with American consumerism and how people buy for status rather than use See iPhones for the most prominent example
That's why we need competition Brand loyalty is the worst thing ever If amd or Intel manages to give me better price performance ratio I couldn't give a fuck I'll get an Intel GPU instantly if they'd manage to deliver
Well a lot of this demand has to be manufactured The Microcenters are few and far between so people will drive a couple of hundred miles to get to one on launch day It makes demand look higher than it is As for demand online that can be controlled They release cards just fast enough for them to sell out to cause people to panic buy when they see the in stock on a site These people would otherwise not buy impulsively if they felt they could order one at any time This is a game that manufacturers play and master Product sells out in under an hour is better advertising than Gamers line up to buy cards and company does a solid by keeping shelves stocked past initial demand even though they sell the same amount of cards in both scenarios
You are out your mind A 600nm die on 5nm TSMC is roughly 300 that s the 4090 which they are selling for 1600
Is that in Reddit's ToS
Edit Nvidia has taken down my photo after I submitted a DMCA Takedown info on submitting a DMCA takedown to Nvidia can be found here There really isn't much of a chance of Nvidia paying me The best I can hope for is for them to remove my photo from the blog I think I have submitted a DMCA takedown for that photo now I wait
Lol good luck with that
That's not how it works At all
Edit Nvidia has taken down my photo after I submitted a DMCA Takedown info on submitting a DMCA takedown to Nvidia can be found here It's one of the photo's of the line outside
The line of people buying 4090s tells nvidia people will buy regardless of price

And the 4060 which will be a 4050 die will still be a 6GB card LOL
That price point is to make the 4090 look like a steal they'll drop the price once they've sold enough 4090s and 30 series cards If the 4080 16gb sells out on launch we're doomed though
Scalpers dont count as people
900 is still overpriced but acceptable 1k is overkill for any x080 level card If they saw the price increase from a pure cost perspective from the beginning they shouldn't launch these as 4080 4090 Thats what the 4090 Ti and Titan are meant to be Any price increase should be moderate and expected from generation to generation 2080 was 699 3080 was the same IIRC at MSRP How on earth the 4080 is 1200 Thats over 71 price increase At least that's IMO
Benefit how Notice they announced no replacement So these alleged uninformed consumers now have to pay an overpriced 1200 minimum instead if they want the latest gen How does that benefit those consumers All this tells me is there probably won't be any replacement for this gpu like a 4070 till well into next year when they have cleared all 3000 series stock which btw they still refuse to price anything below the 3080 TI under MSRP 2 years later Pretty sure they are forbidding AIBs retailers from doing so because the only 3080 I see go under MSRP still is one using a 200 gift card work around to avoid lowering the actual price below MSRP They basically set a new MSRP for the 3000 lineup only lowered the overpriced ridiculous margin ones like the Tis and 3090 and now they're sticking to it no matter what while layering the 4000 series on top No one is benefiting here becauase they didn't lower the price of the real 4080 from the insane 1200 price hike and they just canceled this one with 0 word of any replacement which means there very likely will be none anytime soon
oh please with Nvidias track record all thsi does is help sell up the last of the 3080's
Now they'll know it's a 4070 and maybe not buy at MSRP You are right but it's a very small victory This 4070 feels like it should have been a 4060 to me
People can whine online but the market decides what the cards are worth Ultimately everyone always wants everything for cheaper this is not new The only wrongdoing by Nvidia here was the misleading naming which went against GPU conventions
Honestly it s confusing but I expect that most people spending money at this level of graphic processing have done some due diligence and has some level of understanding as to what they re buying
No I meant wait
Effin nailed it This must be an epiphany
lmao
I bet this card will actually eventually be marketed as a 4060ti Its to slow to be a 4070
Definitely has access to the future
The 70 model is usually the best price to performance card
This guy Reddits
face with tears of joy
your luck will change when they update the GPU Z you have a 4070 outperformed by my 3080
Sticker on the card
Which ones were these
I know that AMD did that several times over and Nvidia made some handicapped questionably labeled 1030 and 1060s but haven't heard about team green rebranding chips
My interpretation is that they looked at the success of the 4090 launch and don't even need to pretend that there's a cheaper 4080 they can just go ahead and raise prices
Who is talking about inflation like this I hate that the tech channels have been peddling the inflation shit without understanding how food inflation and goods inflation work differently Your grocery store is different CPI and tech products is different CPI a GPU shouldn't be priced this high within 2 years due to 'inflation'
Nobody is saying that the price increase is ok but if all they do is rename it and leave the price then at least they're being honest in their greediness They're not going to sell like the 30 series though and it will hopefully bite them in the ass
You're not going to find a lot of sympathy for the poor suffering profit margins of a company that made ten billion dollars last year
NVIDIA had a 2x node shrink and decided to not pass on the gains Also harder my ass NVIDIA don't even get credit for the node shrink thats all TSMC
No not even close A 4060 is not going to give 3090 3090ti performance
It's not just the bus width the entire core of the GPU is not something we have ever seen on a x80 GPU
There is Since at least 10xx series the 192 bit memory interface has been a xx60 card It's odd that they moved that up all the way to 4080 That specific bus width might have been with the XX60s since the 10 series but that doesn't mean it was the determining factor GDDR6X was also not the memory used for any XX60 card before this but it is now Putting GDDR6X and keeping a 192 bit bus means the memory bandwidth is going to go up overall it's apples to oranges and again completely arbitrary in regards to its labeling It's not a standard just a single spec pattern that everyone wants to complain about without any regard to the rest of the hardware on the card All that's really necessary in the end is that different raw hardware on the cards should be a different model number regardless of what that is Even my aging 1070 has a wider memory interface And half the overall bandwidth which is what actually matters and only in terms of loading data into VRAM not even overall performance That just means it was massively overpriced to begin with Won't argue with that and that's just down to opinion anyway I'd certainly never pay that for a card
Bus width only gets you so far
Regardless of any bs evidence you post it s still not a 4060ti Percentage vs the flagship does not designate where a GPU model lies in the product stack
With a 95 increase over the 3080 10gb diabolicle value
You are vastly exaggerating According to hardware unbox Their game average for the 3090ti was 90 fps 140fps for the 4090 At 4k high settings Thats more like a 65 improvement over 3090ti 80 over 3090
Are you sure it's 2x Last time I looked 4090 was around 45 50 faster in 4K gaming benchmarks without DLSS than the previous flagship 3090 Ti which is 1x Unless I'm mistaken as I thought 100 faster equates to 2X Or did you not mean 4K
4090 is 2x more powerful then 3090ti
It s faster than a 3080 by a decent margin It s not really the same tier as the flagship card
I mean based on the size of it you could just use two 3090s
this is the reason i am going to wait and see what amd has to offer and then if it isnt worth it either i will go for a 6900xt that is around 790 euros in gaming it is near 3090 levels
stop spreading lies the 4090 is around 65 better than the 3090 ti on average in 4k raster and its not even 2x in every raytracing game just in some Are you part of nvidias marketing to spread missinformation here to make the 4090 look like an amazing deal its trash value Thats it
People thinking 4090 is great when I'm looking at a computer being over 1kw At full tilt you'd be paying 0 07 to 0 14 an hour to play it lmao
What a pointless comparison to put 3090ti and 4080 against each other in the first place The 3090ti started off as 2000 msrp why would you just not compare more equally priced hardware such as 4080 vs 3080ti instead
It's not even a 'good deal' in the US unless you're only comparing 40xx cards The performance per dollar is very in line with the 'good deal' cards from last generation all of the performance gains come with a matching price increase
As much as I dislike NVIDIA's greed the higher prices outside of the US is because non US currencies are being massacred with the exchange rates For example the Euro used to be 20 more valuable than the USD Now the USD is actually slightly worth more This significantly increases the prices of US products The strength of a currency is entirely outside of NVIDIA's control so those prices in Europe aren't going to come down All Europeans etc can do is hope for a quick end to the war
yep 2530 USD in Turkey for the 4090 1600 USD 18 VAT 2530 USD
It should be no more than 600 But what do I know I'm just a techboomer
Would be hard to find a card in stock though
The 4080 was 10 faster than the 3090 Ti in NVIDIA's latest benchmark The 4090 was 100 faster in that same benchmark That's a gigantic difference yet the 4080 costs 1200 and the 4090 1600 Would you spend 1200 to get 10 more performance when you know that spending a few hundred bucks extra gets you 100 more performance in stead So yea like I said it has TERRIBLE value Especially when you consider you can buy used 3090's for 900 now DLSS3 also isn't as good as you think it is go watch HWUnboxed video on it
I Have no fanboy mentality at all i had Amd gpus in the past did not have any problems the only reason i went with NVidia last was because Xplane 11 was still using open gl and there alot issues and perfrmance tanks on radeon cards now that there is vulkan ap in the sim and xplane 12 is vulkan only it is no big deal to me if amd have good product and its cheaper then I will go with them which is the best value and fits my use case the name on box means nothing to me
The gray bars show the raw performance without DLSS 3
yes that's how they are trying to make the other cards look slower They do a comparison of rasterization and then the highest level dlss those cards offer hence why you are seeing DLSS 2 vs 3
If you focus on the gray part you see each cards performance before any DLSS
If that's true then why are they still selling at or above MSRP except the 3090s I'm not saying you're wrong because I know Nvidia had a terrible financial quarter and they cited falling GPU sales which conflicts with the fact that a lot of their GPUs are still selling at inflated prices The whole situation just seems to be defying basic fundamentals of supply and demand
Don't you mean bear with me Jumps away
Not in duopoly if AMD has similar perf then they will only shave off 100 tops for similar Nvidia perf if the perf will be lackluster then they will have to entice with pricing a lot like with Ryzen 1000 3000 only when AMD was competitive the price hiking started same shit will happen if Radeons will be too good
Exactly They have the 90ti just in case it will be 15 20 faster than the 4090 If And cones shy of 10 to the 4090 that would be great while undercutting it heavily since nvidia stays cocky but we have inflation mining is dead Gamer dont pay that much money I mean they unlaunched the 12gb 4060 4070 mix card lol they need to cut the price heavily
given the fact that the 3090ti is around 10 faster than the 6950xt What It was nearly 40 faster at launch AMD has done great with drivers and it's only around 27 faster now but it never has been anywhere close of within 10 Lets be real here
More like 3080Ti but yes basically 4080 12gb is just a nicer 3080Ti lower power new features probably a bit better RT should do relatively better at lower resolutions but worse at higher ones which is expected due the sheer difference in mem b w alone Either way AMD should be able to beat the 4080 16gb easily AMD goals is around 50 better perf watt per a gen so 50 better than a 6900XT is already above 4080 16gb Nvidia numbers put the 16gb like 30 better than 3090Ti
Well yeah based on MSRP but the pricing being exploitative is the most obvious problem 3090 Ti is 1000 brand new right now It should be 600 4090 should be 1000 4080 16GB should be 700 4080 12GB should be 400
A card can embarrass the other without winning in market share NVidia is bought a LOT more in prebuilds by people that dont care about PCs and have zero clue how they work Furthermore in a lot of non western countries they are the only brand people know when hearing GPUs AMD could release a GPU with double the power of a 4090 and halft the price and the 4090 would still be bought more often trust me Market share doesnt have to equal dominance in performance
Yes but that steam charts percentage only give a picture of historic sales not current
Yeah but they'll call it astroglide
EVGA finally learned the 5 d's of DLSS
I have a feeling the 4090 Ti might come out in January or March next year if AMD surprises NVIDIA This may be a response to 7700 XT or 7800 XT being better than NVIDIA expected and they're cancelling the 4080 naming for this card so as not to be humiliated
They aren t making any hardware changes this close to launch Especially not ones that drastic It ll be a name change and maybe a price drop
The cards are already manufacturer lmfao They can't change something like that
Eh NVIDIA has been using x04 series dies with 256 bit memory interfaces for the xx80 cards since Kepler with the 680 It sucks but the 3080 was the outlier here
The general mood of the market right now is mostly you guys are gonna buy what we want you to buy And if that means pushing down launch dates because they're sitting on a shitload of inventory they will do it I mean even AMD is kinda doing that with their Ryzen 7000 by having them at a pretty bad price performance ratio when you consider the whole platform For the vast majority of users that means the only affordable choice is stuff that's several years old Aka Ryzen 5000 and from the feedback I'm getting from retailers contact I have it's working they're selling 5800 based PC like crazy And as consumers there ain't much you can do about it except hope and wait
Where did I say that I want them to waste them Lol
4060 not a 4070
Makes sense given the timing of this announcement
People just throw out things to be dramatic The 4090 could have been priced at an MSRP 2100 and it would still sell out I totally understand people refusing to buy cards at a certain price point out of principle but there are enough out there with enough cash to buy these type of cards whether it's the extreme enthusiast gamer to the content creator
It would be interesting to know if they are truly sold out or they are just pretending for a few days that they are sold out as a marketing strategy
wow It is interesting to see how different the situation is in USA vs Europe Here in Europe nobody is buying the 4090 I guess the current 1 1 makes the 4090 too expensive
I think it's up to 20 faster than a 3080 without dlss depending on the game but as low as 10 It was super underwhelming
It's slightly slower in RT and raster performance the only case it's faster than the 3090ti is if you use DLSS 3 And considering modders have already gotten DLSS 3 on 30 series cards then it doesn't even have that going for it The only reason the 4070 is 2x as fast as a 3090to is because Nvidia explicitly disabled the 3090ti's ability to generate pseudo frames in a config file The price is only fine if you are ok with price to performance stagnation and artificial limitations
With this higher price the market may decide that this price is right but only a smaller amount of that market They aren t idiots They probably made released fewer cards than usual Still sold out shocker
It makes it even more hilarious that they just removed LHR when mining is effectively dead you can stop holding back the applause Nvidia
So your saying they did the right 't have happened at all they are not doing the right thing They are correcting their shitty behavior
Nooo Rtx 4090 for free or Nvidia bad They are not allowed to make profit based on what people will pay for their products
You fanboys would do anything to justify Nvidia's scummy marketing huh
Nvidia is not your friend lmao is a company designed to make as much money as it can is not like the pricing changed
The hate is well placed the same card will be called the 4070 down the line then release at 50 less
Some people just live to fanboy be blind It's a company don't defend shitty behavior
Sorry you are downvoted because I agree lol Yes Nvidia is not our friend they don't make these decisions out of the goodness of their hearts and their primary motivator is profits But at the end or the day I'm gonna praise a company for doing the right thing even if said company has had a long streak of doing the wrong thing Idk how people expect companies like this to get better if all we ever do is put them down even when they make the right decisions
It depends on which model has fatter margins If the 4080 16 GB has better margins they'll want to maximize sales of that model
lol fr haha
I think a lot of AIBs contract out to Foxconn etc to actually produce their cards just like NVIDIA does with their FE cards I know EVGA was using them and I'd expect there to be others What would probably happen is the AIBs would only be allowed to cancel their reserved production capacity if they found someone to buy 't let them unreserve all of the extra production capacity they scheduled when they misjudged how long the GPU crypto mining ridiculousness would go on for I suspect that a few of the AIBs have a lot more RTX 3000 chips than they currently know what to do with putting them in a situation where they need to use their board production time on GPUs they've already paid for instead of buying gobs of RTX 4000 chips This leaves NVIDIA with more unsold chips than expected and in need of the board production capacity to do something with them themselves before they have to report it to investors as a ton of expenditure without the expected revenue to accompany it tl dr NVIDIA fucked everyone by getting greedy and manufacturing way too many GPUs when they saw how much people were actually willing to pay for them without taking into account that the only people willing to pay that much were rich people who don't give a shit how much anything costs and people trying to use the cards as an ATM
I purchased my evga gtx 1080 SC for 550 euro 800 sounds ridiculous
How do you factor operating cost in your example What if they make 11 million next year but operating cost is 25 higher due to Tariffs wars shortages etc What Is Operating Income Revenue as we said refers to earnings before the subtraction of any costs or expenses In contrast operating income is a company's profit after subtracting operating expenses which are the costs of running the daily business Edit okay legitimately asking a question here If you know the answer it works be nice to hear it not just down 's operating income over the years to really compare so we can estimate what these cards really should cost It can be less or more I'm not arguing for either here
Well that is why inflation exists to make sure that infinite growth is possible
this problem in late stage capitalism is really a problem People just don't get how luxury products inflate way way way faster than anything else during late and final stage capitalism It happened during the fall of Rome too We should nationalize nvidia amd intel and every other too big to fail tech company at this point
Honestly does anyone consider 10 growth as a failure Only wall street because of their projections but not really otherwise right
AMD needs to a card that cam compete in the high end They matched it last time but I don't know if they can do it this time
Sure I ll bet you have full insight into the whole supply chain Feel free to drop the BOM and COGS of the 3080 I ll wait
Sure by all means try to sue or claim since you think you know how it works
Oh Tb instead of gb lmao I missed that I heard the 4080 12tb will be a monster of a card rolling on the floor laughing
Eh to each their own If it's worth it to them then why not
It's an event where they get to hang out with a bunch of like minded people for a day They probably had the same amount of fun that someone going camping would and hopefully have a GPU to bring home as a souvenir
Wouldnt that actually be a cartell
Agreed curious to see where all the mid range cards stack up to prior gen and what the price is I'm not optimistic
Yeah no wrongdoing in trying to nearly double the msrp of cards with a minor performance uplift According to their own benchmarks the 4080 12gb was about 10 slower than a 3090ti It was a 4070 with 4080 branding in an attempt to sell a card typically found for 400 prior to the 20 series and 500 after the 20 series The 4080 16GB is almost double msrp on a card that s been found around 550 650 for the last decade It s a decent performance uplift of 50 but entirely negated by the cost increase It s going to be taken to the cleaners when it s reviewed
Yeah that's the 4080 16gb
Indeed 192 bit memory bus should be 4060 territory I wonder what they have been cooking for 4070 if they think that 192 bit memory bus belongs to 4080
Was thinking the same The number of cuda cores between the supposedly 4080 16gb and 4090 is about 3x compared with 3080 and 3090 Also rest of the specs could've been cranked up Let's hope that tech reviewers go hard on them when they get released
Both the 3060Ti and the 3080 had it beat on that front last gen
Not this time unfortunately All of their line up offer terrible value for perfomance

The 4090 only increased the price by 100 The 4080 is 500 more expensive It's not comparable
Nah The kind of people that ran out to buy a 4090 are a limited supply There are only so many of them They are going to buy the top card day one no matter what it cost Nvidia should just make it 5000 and see what happens lol Maybe raise it to 2500 with the 4090 ti and start working it up to 10k These people were buying Titans back in the day 2080 ti's etc It's nothing new It's financially irresponsible but it's their money so let them spend it The other 99 of us aren't going to buy that card And I don't think many of us will pay 1200 for a 4080 The 3080 at 699 was kind of my limit on what I'm comfortable spending on something I truly do not need Most of us do have a functioning graphic card in our systems already Even if I have enough cash to go buy 10 4080's it's still a no That type of money is better spent on real stuff Like my house my car vet bills getaways emergency fund loaning money to family in a tight spot etc
What makes you think that the launch of the 4090 was a success Is it because it sold out a product selling out can easily be manipulated by regulating available stock only the actual units sold can tell if it was indeed a success I would not be surprised if the sales of the 4090 were not great and Nvidia is doing damage control by canning a card they now know will not sell well
Agreed
NVIDIA don't even get credit for the node shrink thats all TSMC Generational improvements in IPC instructions per cycle aren't really applicable for GPUs the same way as for CPUs CPU marketing But the principle applies to help make u MushroomSaute 's point using other words Yes Nvidia got some gains exclusively based on TSMCs work but if they had designed Ada for Samsung 8N we would still have seen improvements Someone could guesstimate those improvements by looking at performance per watt for 40 series and scale them back to 30 series If they had kept feature parity and just revised into an Ampere V2 based on what they learned the first time around we've kinda almost seen Intel do this you'd see even better improvement within the same die size
Yeah TSMC developed the node process NVIDIA designed the processors manufactured with that process And part of the design involves dealing with problems that appear at fabrication processes this small One such problem is that electrons can literally move through closed gates if they're too small which is a critical issue in processor design called quantum tunneling There are solutions one is to simply not get smaller than that threshold where quantum tunneling could occur another is to find different materials that may be more resistant to this effect at that size There are others of course but developing solutions requires time and effort and the solutions themselves have a cost Another problem is the breakdown of Dennard scaling since the early 2000s essentially making transistors smaller no longer grants proportionately more power efficiency Because the power density increases the smaller we go it can lead to unsafe operating temperatures A solution to this is the idea of dark silicon in which a large portion of the chip is strategically kept 'dark' at any given time so that the chip doesn't become too hot This is likely a reason we're seeing GPUs get so big we need space to let the transistors 'breathe' and we need extra reinforcement on the cooling mechanisms when we do increase the operating power Although it's a solution to that problem dark silicon causes a lot of extra complexity in chip design and development because the chip has to manage what areas are kept dark depending on what it's doing at any given moment These have already been problems and they aren't going to get any better the smaller we go with the node process Developing solutions takes time and money and we're going to see that as consumers
that is not how generational performance leaps works The tech inside of it and the different between the card on top of the 192 bit memory is and has been tied to xx60 series GPU's This is nvidia wanting in on the pandemic scalping money post pandemic
Isn't that how generations kinda work You get the same performance at lower price
3090 is barely faster than a 3080 2000 and 3000 series didn't have much generational performance increases either This is similar to 1060 matching previous gen 980
And half the overall bandwidth which is what actually matters and only in terms of loading data into VRAM not even overall performance You can call it arbitrary if you want but historically these are the ones that share the same memory interface GTX 760 GTX 960 GTX 1060 GTX 1660 RTX 2060 RTX 3060 RTX 4070 See something off there What about pricing GTX 1070 370 449 FE RTX 2070 499 599 FE RTX 3070 499 RTX 4070 899
Yes 100 increase 2x But 50 increase 1 5x 1x would be no increase
You are literally bottlenecked on most things at 1440p He definitely just saw the chart of cyberpunk 2077
I think it's like 70 faster on average
It's close to 2x over the og 3090 with RT on
so my electricity price is 8c per kw if I play 5 hours every god damn day it's 11 2 a month what a big deal here
Also people are comparing it to the 3090 when saying it's a good deal but people seem to be forgetting the 3090 was a terrible deal at its launch price It was only marginally more powerful than the flagship 3080 at over double the price Nvidia has never had a 1500 consumer card before to my knowledge
I remember paying 849 EUR for a device that cost 549 in the US In 2016 Today it s not that much worse Most 4090 cards cost 2 100 to 2 500 EUR
These cards are not made in the US so why they are priced in the USD I mean it doesn't make much sense to me apart of them wanting to maximize their profit
You can t really Compare a used mining card price to a new one Nvidia own benchmarks are 10 23 faster without DLSS Just google and look at all 3 Dunno the tiny tear of the overlay in flight sim vs 2x the frame rate is a good trade off HU is the only review that had anything negative to say out side of the latency is just native And value Look at those same benchmarks the 4090 in one is 5 faster for 33 more money In same benchmark without DLSS the 4080 stomps the 3090ti one not used for mining 4080 seems like a steal t people wait for good reviews Clearly if you like flight sim the 4080 is a bargain
face screaming in fearsmiling face with horns
How many times does AMD have to beat Nvidia on benchmark price before people stop saying you don't know that their next card will necessarily beat it It'll be hard not to beat this lineup
They can t allow that anymore no one buys midrange for 600 Since Turing and end of Pascal mining was a reason why the cards raised up to 2 times msrp Now its finally dead you see it now live what happens A 70 card was at 350 with maxwell Now nvidia wanted 900 1100 for it and it backlasches A 70 card for 500 is actually insane But people got used to it Its our fault Bit nvidia wanted to keep the mega mining prices which normal gamer will not pay Look at the 3090ti it halfed its price in a short amount of time Same will happen here Especially with inflation and rising costs everywhere Whoever can play the waiting game now will get a good deal or bite his ass after 8 months when prices half Even the 4080 16 gb is actually a 70 Card There a lot of room to the 90 Card Its almost like nvidia is forcing you too the 90 card
Please link me a single review that had the 3090Ti at 40 ahead of 6950XT on average with DXR DLSS off
you got owned my guy
Not necessarily The tsmc process is prob more than the samsung process The gddr6 memory is more expensive than the gddr6 A little bit of inflation in the world since 2020 So I can't fault the 4080 for not being 700 I would have understood 800 and 600 But raising the price 500 is outrageous and raising the 70 series 400 is even worse Especially when a 6900 xt is 699 new But I've seen the youtube reiewers saying the 4080 is going to be a well received card and the price is justified so idk
Has any AMD GPU ridiculed an Nvidia GPU in the last 8 years
Go by more recent GPUs and the gap is even larger The first Radeon Rx 6k series in the list is the 6600xt It's below the 3050 3060 3060ti 3070 3070ti 3080 3080ti and 3090 Yes that's right Steam has more 3090 users than 6600xt users despite the 6600xt being the most popular RX 6k series card
You guys made my day face with tears of joy
What Nvidia is going to learn is that consumers won t buy period They ll use their money on essential goods which are skyrocketing as a result of inflation like food or energy I for one can wait to see how badly Nvidia s q4 earnings are
Okay so walk me through what you see as alternatives to the relaunch and rebrand you're currently moaning about
Seriously It's a 30 performance drop off from the 16 to the 12 The 4070 shouldn't drop off that hard
Nah it's a full fat 104 die It's a 70 series gpu
That would be dumb There s probably more stock on the way the plausible reason is that there s limited shelf space and retailers can t and don t want to dedicate it all to a single product
I haven't heard about the modding thing that's actually pretty neat Does it actually offer the same performance gains though And price to performance stagnation just isn't correct It's 899 1999 45 of the price for roughly similar performance if DLSS 3 0 really isn't a selling point anymore Is a 122 improvement in performance price stagnation Edit The source for the modding is just one Redditor's comment with no proof of concept or provided config file Not to say it's faked but I'm still skeptical for now Edit again months later The redditor made it up completely They have since deleted their comment now that FG is actually available in CP2077
right
How does recognizing Nvidia taking the right steps jusitfy nvidias misleading marketing
Speak for yourself Me and Nvidia totally got baked together and hit up 7 11 and got Slurpees I got blue and red mixed and Nvidia got pina colada then said it was gross so we shared mine Asus came too
Who said Nvidia was my friend Yes like all for profit companies Nvidia tries to generate profits
If Nvidia does the right thing my first thought isn't must hate Nvidia But you do you king
People here are so emotional lmao so many strawman Recognizing a company taking a step in the right direction is not defending shitty behavior person facepalming
Lol right Nvidia isn't your friend came out of nowhere Obviously a company isn't my friend lmao person facepalming
Ahh you're talking dollars not sales numbers Fair
You report income expenses and profit to shareholders If operating costs go up and outpace income profit goes down Shareholders see that though income went up 10 it actually only accounted for n increase in profit due to expenses Depending on the type of company having no real profit can be fine as long as the company is growing income year over year because people think you can always keep income up and decrease
I mean like whenever it s appropriate not randomly haha face with tears of joy Trust me I don t want to be that guy haha
They're not wrong
Nah They need cards that outperform the 80 series 70 series and 60 series for reasonable prices AMD is not going to beat the 4090 and even if they did who is going to buy it

The GPU will just load the entire game into the VRAM lol
12tb of vram would be a wet dream for animation studios like pixar or dreamworks
Huh
Yeah We need some serious competition Bring it on AMD and Intel
If it's overpriced then Nvidia will have to adjust due to lack of sales Purposefully giving misleading names to products is immoral The existence of an expensive gpu is not
8 bit back to our roots edition smiling face with open hands
It has been leaked rumored a good while how the 4070 specs was 160bit and 10gb of VRAM Regardless saying its x60 due to mem bus is disohonest since they upped the L2 cache by alot Its basically similar to AMDs strategy big cache and downgrade bus to keep mem size more in line 12gb x70 is much better correct than 8 16gb
Yeah the only 2 that make sense to buy honestly One for budget the other for high end gaming with relative price increase
Sticker on the GPU Z page
Cool thanks I wrongly assumed you meant rebranding previous gen like AMD but this makes a lot more sense I also hadn't heard about this
UK here went from 650 to 1270 basically doubled
Yeah surprised if they were gonna rip people off they didn't start with the giys at the top 2k starting most buying the 4090 probably wouldn't even have blinked at it But instead they double the price of the 4080 like wtf Ugh
The perf watt improvement from the 30 to 40 series is almost entirely down to the node improvement Thats quite litteraly the point and you do see the performance you would expect from a double node jump If they back ported ADA to the samsung node they would see a decrease in rasterisation performance because they have allocated more transistor budget to RT cores and other features At best they would maintain performance parity while offering slightly higher RT performance and DLSS 3 0
No shit but that dosent change anything TSMC charges more for the sillicon now but not anywhere near the amount NVIDIA is charging extra for their cards They are taking the performance improvements TSMC made and adding it directly to their profit margin rather than providing better cost to performance to consumers Thats why people are outraged
The memory bitrate doesn t matter much in the end It still has a good amount of bandwidth in the 4080 12GB Good example of it not mattering much is AMD s 4096 bit memory interface on the Radeon 7
You don t get 80 class performance on the next gen s 60 class part normally
Going from 20 series to 30 series was a large upgrade in performance Not as much as 30 40 but it was still a very big jump
Okay so what You should be comparing by price rather than model name because as we've established it is arbitrary and the price and performance matter more than the model name So they bumped up the price of the 4070 Compare it to the 3080 then Problem solved We see a modest performance gain I'm not arguing that this gen is crazy good or anything but it's still better price to performance at each price level and now with the unlaunch the cards with different hardware all have different model names There isn't any problem except that people don't like having to change their reference points but it's hardly outrage worthy Just a note they dropped the 1080 Ti down to 352 bit from the 384 bit 980 Ti and 780 Ti and the 960 and 980 were also reduced from the 760 and 780 So there are other historical examples of them dropping the bus within the same nominal class of card
In Hardware Unboxed's review at 4K the 4090 was around 70 faster on average than the 3090 ti I don't really think anything below 4K should be taken into consideration cuz pairing this card with anything below 4K is literally burning money
3090 is not flag ship of past gen 3090ti is Unless you have different name for 3090ti
Power creep Also consider my office gets to 90f easily with the door closed during the summer while the rest of the house is 72f This is just with a 3080 and i9 Now we are moving into the realm of space heater which can put out crazy heat ACs going to have to fight it which is more power I'm considering getting a dryer exhaust tube and fan to suck the heat out the house
Not that it closes the gap much between the two prices but don t forget to add sales tax to US prices I got the 699 3089 FE at launch which in total was 760
NVIDIA is an American corporation Prices are set in US dollars If your currency tanks relative to the US dollar you will have to pay more The high prices in Europe has nothing to do with NVIDIA NVIDIA set the MSRP of the 4090 at 1600 USD Since the Euro lost all of its 20 advantage over the USD you pay 1600 Euro However Europe also has a 20 VAT tax So you end up at around 1950 Euro as the baseline price for the 4090 So again NVIDIA is not the reason prices are higher in Europe The MSRP is exactly the same as the US It's just that Euro is no longer 20 more valuable and you have to pay 20 VAT tax Back when the 3090 launched the Euro still traded at 1 2 1 vs the USD hence the MSRP was 1500 Euro at those rates the 1500 USD MSRP converted to 1200 Euro then add 20 24 VAT 1500 Euro If the 3090 launched today it would be more expensive because the Euro is now trading roughly 1 1 with the USD
He was the one that brought up value not me He's comparing current excess gpu prices rather than launch msrp too Of course amd will beat Nvidia in pure rasterization value They always price their stuff slightly below Nvidia And will likely continue doing so forever because their market share is so far behind that they'll never catch up if they ever dare to price equally or above Nvidia
It doesnt matter when AMD or more correctly ATi did it like 2 decades ago their marketshare was below 50 HECK 4600 series vs ATis 9700 Pro was a bloodbath but the 4600 is considered to be one of the best gens of Nvidia in sales and general Btw it took Nvidia one full gen of hot and loud GPUs FX 5000 to to touch ATis now last gen 9700 Pro lol And even after that u had continous competition and Radeons where always below 50 share even back in the terascale days with amazing price perf The GPU market is dead and while we dont have a limbering Radeon anymore the 2010s mainly after Hawaii where a rough time for AMD as a whole they where going to be brankrupt if it wasnt for Zen they dont care about fighting the actual market CPUs are more profitable and WAY more important than gamers toys
Bruh nobody is moaning Stop making bs up You felt the need to come to the defense of Nvidia butthurt much
Looking at GN launch reviews of the 3070 from 23 months ago RTX 3080 FE in RDR2 152 FPS RTX 3070 FE 122 FPS
Wait it's a 70 die with a cut mem bus What the hell is going on there
A xx70 card with a 192 bit memory
I haven't heard about the modding thing that's actually pretty neat Does it actually offer the same performance gains though The modder got 2x the performance on a 2070 hard to tell if it'll be the same in a 3090 ti but I assume it'll be comparable to the 4070 And price to performance stagnation just isn't correct It's 899 1999 45 of the price for roughly similar performance That's ignoring the fact that the ecosystem the 3090ti launched in is completely different from the one we are in now You can find 3090 TI's on sale brand new for 1000 1100 regularly before the launch of the 4070 and it's only going to go down in the lead up to the launch In reality you're looking at maybe a 15 price to performance uplift assuming the price of a 3090ti doesn't change at all until the 4070 is launched And that's even assuming that the 4070 is going to be in stock at 900

If I set your house on fire but turn around and extinguish it the next moment I did the right thing right
Sounds dope Can I come next time Just don't tell Gigabyte he has a bit of an explosive temper
Shilling way too hard towards a company repeatedly caught in shady practice
But this is the thing they should've done in the first place Going 'Oh I guess I won't scam you ' Isn't doing the right thing because they shouldn't have had scamming on the table to begin with
Thank you So how does that compare with Nvidia GPU prices over the years Or is there no correlation
It s a fine discussion to have don t listen to them

Need more VRAM space Don't want to delete any of my Steam library I only have 150 games loaded into it
Not just the game your entire disk space and cloud accounts and secret porn hard drive as well
It is not dishonest Since memory hasn't gotten faster from Ampere to Ada the added L2 cache was a necessity in order to cope with the bigger GPUs This is what happened to the 4090 same 384 bit bus bigger L2 cache upgrade AMD hasn't downgraded its memory RDNA2 features the same 256 bit bus as RDNA1 but adds in Infinity Cache So it's still an upgrade just like the 4090 4080 and ex 4080 12GB now 4070 adds in L2 cache and then takes away memory bandwidth This is not an upgrade it's a side grade
Yep and so far the 4090 is the best value card of the 3 revealed not good
Jensen putting stickers on your monitor personally
I actually looked and the 3090 I have now is the one with that chip Performs pretty good though I can't say it doesn't bother me a little lol
TSMC didn't make the performance improvements they simply made their process smaller That's it NVIDIA designed everything else using that and also had to deal with the ever worsening issues that I mentioned above I guess they should be expected to force their engineers to solve those issues for free on top of the other R D on DLSS RT SER You're paying for the extra price from TSMC as well as the extra time and effort required of NVIDIA even beyond just what we see as consumers
But TSMC cost per wafer to Nvidia does mean that Nvidia has to gouge us on rtx 4080 16gb its 95 more than the 3080 10gb they are jut trying squeeze 80 series buyers as much as they the price is ridiculous
The 3060ti and 2080 would like to have a word with you
So last generation doesn't count
1060 had 980 level performance 2060 had 1080 level performance 3060 was a let down but 3060Ti bettered the 2080S
20 series basically had similar performance per compared to 10 series since they priced everything up a tier 30 series seems like a good increase because the 20 series was trash in raw perf 30 40 is a massive increase comparable to going from 10 30 2 generations
Okay so what You should be comparing by price rather than model name because as we've established it is arbitrary and the price and performance matter more than the model name So they bumped up the price of the 4070 Compare it to the 3080 then Problem solved We see a modest performance gain Not really because model name has traditionally been about segmentation That is xx50 is lower end xx60 is mainstream xx70 is mid high and xx80 xx90 is high enthusiast end I'm not arguing that this gen is crazy good or anything but it's still better price to performance at each price level and now with the unlaunch the cards with different hardware all have different model names Too early to tell We haven't really seen performance of 4080 or 4070
The flagship of ampere is the 3080 3090 ti are halo products that people bought because of mining fever and general idiocy
I call the 3090ti an overclocked 3090 not a ton of differences between the two chips from what I can tell
but in US you guys dont have taxes at all I heard that depend on what states you are you paying taxes
How exactly are they doubling down
Any 70 or 80 series cards not containing at least 256 bit bus is simply a disgrace
The 6700xt the 7700xt aswell probably has the same memory bus width Both Nvidia and AMD have compensated with larger on die cache Innovation is a thing
Count on redditors to equate an unreleased misleadingly named gpu with selling a fake cancer treatment person facepalming
I'm not shilling I'm simply recognizing when a company takes steps in the right direction It's okay to hop of the hate bandwagon and recognize reality
So I should hate that they are responding to criticism fixing the name and trying to reduce scalping with the verified gamers program Why can't I recognize when a company takes steps in the right direction
GPU price GPU cost x GPU sold overhead profit Price only matters if sales are down if they can raise prices whilst keeping sales up it's good for their bottom line

OP didn't post the picture in question to reddit but let's say they did If Nvidia contacted reddit and asked to license one of the photos posted to their site that they according to this user agreement have the rights to syndicate or distribute and reddit said yes Then the revenue of reddit YouTube Facebook Imgur etc etc with similar agreements for user generated content would nosedive within weeks Some agreements are more clearly worded about it than reddit's but the implication is that you give the right for the service to be able to redistribute your content within and for the purposes of their services and often but far from always for the purposes you intended No one are intending or understanding any sort of free for any use for anyone to take And certainly not for Nvidia to use without licensing from reddit Which neither would do Call me when Getty Images buys reddit then we can have the talk again oP
4080 and ex 4080 12GB now 4070 adds in L2 cache and then takes away memory bandwidth This is not an upgrade it's a side grade But the replacement for N10 was N22 192bit bus but big cache This time they didnt do big die on the x80 tier thats a downgrade but the lower mem bus with big cache is more than fine Its just how Nvidia or AMD decides to design a die for a given segment and line up Its normal for a news gen lower mem bus replace higher mem bus cards in older gens also historically x60 have had 192bit but NOT always there was alot of 128bit which the 4060 should be as well given rumours of AD106
Sticker where the sun don't shine unmanufacture it
ADA is a similar arcitecture to amphere they diden't start from scrarch We also know their margins are near 100 Your basically in fantasy land if you think their costs increased by anywhere near the same amount that they have bumped the cards up by Outside of specific features 90 of the performance jump is from the TSMC node They still don't get credit for that
2080 still outperforms the 3060ti Also that is the 80 class card I m talking about the 3090 Ti
The 2080S still outperformed the 3060ti Also those are 80 class The 12GB 4080 performs between a 3090 and 3090Ti
The 2080ti vastly outperforms the 1080ti 2080 is also much faster than the 1080
Agreed on your first paragraph I think NVIDIA ought to release a 4050 4040 4030 and maybe even lower I think it makes sense for the lower end cards to y'know actually be in the lower half of the range lol But yeah even that would still be a readjustment in how we interpret model numbers and idk if NVIDIA will actually do that this gen Also 1 to your too early to tell statement What I've been saying since the announcement is wait for benchmarks because that's when we finally do have the data to make a statement on whether the price is worth it
They also were good for machine learning
3080 was closer to 3090 than 3090 was to 3090ti iirc
The US has a backwards system where final price after tax isn't known until you are checking out in most cases Sure you can calculate it but most people don't It's much easier in other countries were the after tax price is the price that's displayed Those countries know that the majority of people aren't going to properly calculate the taxes so why not save everyone the headache and arguments However this argument only applies to local sales Online sales can't have the price with tax included displayed since you don't know where your customers are buying from many times Since tax varies by state and sometimes even by county or city you can't set a final price until you know where the customer claims their domicile is Of course that could be easily fixed on websites that you have to log in to shop such as Amazon since they already know your shipping address they could automatically display the final after tax price but then you would have to hire people to keep up with tax laws in each region and update whenever a new law or bill is passed so it's not worth the effort at the end of the day
I eagerly await u dkizzy s informed and rational response
The 6700XT had a on paper launch MSRP of US 480 that is significantly lower than US 900
You should look up the definition of shilling Nothing to do with being paid Recognizing them doing the right thing and simping for them like saying such things as you do you King are completely different
Bro you re literally shilling lmao
Because this entire product line was introduced to exploit the rough shape of the market atm lmao The only card that's a remote upgrade is the 4090 and its almost 2k This is a band aid on a symptom of their exploitation of the market
You're wrong and now using hypothetical situations when provided with the user agreement Classic Do you need an example of what you just mentioned won't happen actually happened so that your whole argument falls apart or do you want to search it yourself
I believe the focus point is that memory bus is a very good indication of chip hierarchy It's possibly the single most consistent aspect of GPU evolution given that the GPU specs itself can change massively between generations Memory in the other hand is consistent It's essentially bus width times clockspeeds and this has been consistent for decades now The point that sticks out of the curve is likely HBM memory with its insanely massive bus width however considering only so very few consumer grade GPUs ever featured HBM memory we can mostly ignore this aspect for this discussion The introduction of big L2 has not changed the memory hierarchy from Ampere to Ada big Ampere is still running 384 bit but with the added L2 So in a nutshell Nvidia has downspec'd everything from the 4080 and below Just think that in Ampere even the 3060 Ti featured a full 256 bit bus About N10 and N22 if you're talking Compute Units and likely AMD's naming scheme you're mostly right I was talking mostly of top line RDNA1 vs top line RDNA2 They did keep 256 bit for their top end
STICKER RECREATED BY DLSS 3
I don't profess to know what their costs increased by but I do know that it takes effort every new node to make up for the smaller transistors even if the architecture has similarities And where's your data coming from that says TSMC is responsible for 90 of the performance jump Most of the performance improvements are coming from pure NVIDIA developments like DLSS As we can see even the 4070 is only a modest bump up from the similarly priced 3080 if you ignore DLSS 3
You don t get 80 class performance on the next gen s 60 class part Also that is the 80 class card I m talking about the 3090 Ti If you meant the 3090 or 3090ti you sure didn't say it You were pretty explicit about 80 class Also a regular 2080 does not outperform a 3060ti the 2080 Super does though if that's what you were thinking of
The 2080S still outperformed the 3060ti That's just incorrect They're very close but the 3060 Ti has about 5 on my 2080S
When launched 2080 was same performance as 1080 ti and costed the same FE costed even more 2080 ti costed another 500 over 1080 ti resulting in significantly less perf
Yup We will have to wait to see What people are upset about I think is the segmentation in order to make room for 30xx series to continue to sell as part of this year's lineup That nvidia up priced it and up modeled it to sell those cards Too bad Intel didn't put any pressure and so hopefully AMD will I have a feeling they might not though
Ok but that's a pretty niche use what percentage of users are buying it for the ML capabilities Probably less than 1 A flagship is something that's supposed to represent the biggest portion of their top end I bet dollars to donuts that nvidia sold at least 10x as many 3080s as 3090s
I m just talking about from a technical standpoint They are the same die but 3090ti had faster memory d be curious how a 3090 OC d to pull the same power stacks up Edit also wanted to say I was kinda making bad joke I fully realize the 3090ti is the flagship Just thought it was interesting when they released the ti how technically similar it was to the 3090
So I'm absolutely right people from the US should stop saying that they buy for example the 4090 for 1 599 because that's not true Surely they will also end up paying about 2 000 just as here in EUROPE we pay about 2 000 euros But it is very confusing to talk about prices between people from the US and the EU when in the EUROPE we always say the final price we pay while in the US they say a fictitious price and it does not reflect reality at all that is they say it without taxes although they know that are going to pay a lot more but it confuses the people here I think that as a citizen of the US and a specific state you should already know more or less how much the final price you will pay for a 1 600 product will be since you will have bought a lot of things all your
Hey bruh Do you always try to troll peeps randomly Where is your informed and rational reason why you even joined the comment fray Surely it was said in jest
Not at all Truly a reddit moment lmao
Me telling a commenter you do you king is not simping shilling for Nvidia lmao
goes ahead and replies to every comment criticizing Nvidia in this comments chain They're deFiNiteLy not shilling
I don't see how the entire product line was introduced to exploit the market or why that means I can't recognize when a company takes steps in the right direction

Prove me wrong senpai
You probably could fit a whole ITX system on the 6090
I'm personally waiting for the 5090 which will also function as a gaming desk
You got some motherboard on your GPU
t 9ITqDyc3g LzajkZf6F8Ow s 19
Look at me I am the motherboard now
Is there a spec limitation for how tall a GPU can be Considering many will have something like a big ass Noctua tower cooler on their CPU why not have something just as tall for the GPU You could put 140mm fans on it while having the heatsink be tall but slimmer rather than just taking up more PCIe slot space and ever more length
Holy shit the dudes hand barely fits around the gpu That gpu sag is gonna be scary af
Is Nvidia planning to build a gpu case for 5090 that will come with an air conditioner
ITX format makes no more sense to me with these cards
It's too big it won't fit It
you dont install the 4090 on the pc you install the pc on the 4090
NR200 isnt fitting
I'm glad I got my 3070 ti lol
This is honestly something I plan to do I m upgrading from a SFF system but have no real reason to go out and buy a new motherboard
Looks good tho
ill be honest video card sizes are just getting too damn big i remember late 90s early 00s in magazines ads and such making fun of ever increasing card sizes but right now its just stupid how big these things are getting
The more I look at A Perfect Grade kit would look pretty sick here
That mesh grill thing with the Asus eye logo on the card is dope af
does it double up as a monitor mount too
Can't nvidia just sell watercooled GPU now instead of adding beefy heatsinks and fans
4090 look at me im the motherboard now
Death by Snu Snu
I have the ASUS ROG STIX itx mobo and asus 3090 in my itx case I have maybe the thickness of a playing card of space left Case says I get a little over over 13 inches I'm gonna use that
The 2 slot 3080Ti FE works great with ITX in a NR200 case with an SFX 750W PSU But the 4080 16GB is 3 slot 3 PCIe power maybe because it will hit over 400W overclocked so I'm out of upgrade options now
12pin PCIE 5 power cable is to be replaced with an IEC 3 pin 240V input for 5090
Good god The power draw of these gpus is getting ridiculous
r DiWHY
Si you re telling me it won t fit into my NR200
Look at me i am the battlestation now
Soon you'll need 2 seperate cases One for the motherboard and other components and one for your GPU
Reminds me of the gatling gun rant from an old Fallout screenshot LP This is the kind of gun they used to put PLANES on It wasn't a case of 'Oh we got this jet fighter it kinda needs something besides missiles and bombs and shit let's strap this thing on ' NO It was a case of a guy making a gun SO awesome that he just stepped back and said 'This shit needs to fly' And everyone's like 'You mean strap the gun to a plane ' And the first guy is like No man I am strapping the plane to the gun The plane is an ACCESSORY '
We have start assessing whether our cases fit inside the GPU at this rate
It s never gonna fit Him it ll fit baby It ll fit
When the graphics card is
Sff must evolve these in picture are 2 sides Can become a flame launcher
This is disgusting i fucking hate this
haha pretty much my reality since 2011 D x200B hoping my itx case the lian li h20 will fit one of those new cards D
Lol I love that the verbiage for this is that the motherboard is installed on a RTX 4090 rather than the 4090 being installed on the mobo
r samespecies
Imagine being Nvidia building the largest card we have ever seen and then throttling hash rates intentionally to crypto mining Petty corporate wokeness that will end up hurting them in the end Sorry Nvidia most consumers are not going to buy this card Your shareholders will be so disappointed
at this point in time you install the motherboard to the gpu and not the other way
Shouldn't it be the other way
4090 Look at me now oh look at me now
lol will this be a step for NVDIA to make CPUs I mean like intel makes GPUs
RTX 10k when
well fuck
Eventually in the 'll just use a graphics card as a
At this point the ITX board is the add on
isn't that a daughterboard
Now it's the mobo who starts to sag
Same comments from the 3090 last time
r AbsoluteUnits
Nvidia Ayo you want a graphics card Me Only a small one Pulls out comically large graphics card
They should make a new form factor of motherboards that are short and wide
So why doesnt this guy give us a review on it
Is this the new 2 slot itx addon board that lets you run programs other than games and brows the internet Just like a sound card
HOLY SHIT LOL That picture just made me pee my pants X
Going to need to dremel my case to make room thumbs up
ITX daughter board installed on an RTX 4090 motherboard
What a monstrosity
I m going yo need a bigger case
I'm more surprised that people aren't talking about the weight of these things Are GPU's shipping with support beams now That kind of weight on the PCI slot can't be good for the motherboard
imma need to catch up on gtc 2022
This cant be sustainable
The 4090 is its own PC case
Looks like putting a spotlight on a pistol lol
Ah next time our pc case will be built around gpu not the motherboard
That s pretty much what my 3080 looks like on my ITX board Very comical to me
If it s stupid and it works it s not stupid
That cooler is ridiculous
Here i was getting excited to build not exactly an sff case but as close as i can get I'm really wanting to move to 4k 120 at the minimum larger cases just make sense unfortunately Maybe watercooling would still make it possible
Now add a 1U heatsunk to the CPU
Would you like some fries with your ketchup would you like some popcorn with your butter
The motherboard is a daughter board at this point
Thing is with the 4090 being a 3 1 2 slot card there's no point to standard ATX boards with it especially if it's a DDR5 system that runs better with only two ram sticks anyways ITX boards might just be the best solution for new builds
sweats profusely in mITX case
At this point GPUs should come with cases where we install motherboard in
This is like that picture of Shaq his wife gf lol
Funny how it not 4090 installed on a ITX motherboard
So the rumours were
these things are gonna have to ship with support structures or rip pcie slots
I think we are going to get to the point where the GPU will be like 90 95 of the pc talking about the size
quality content i'm here for
No no no I don't want to upgrade my cooler master case from 2010
Isn t this a fantastic expression of why the motherboard shouldn t exist The CPU GPU and Motherboard should all be integrated
No way thats someone from ltt Look how vascular that dudes arms are Everyone from ltt looks like a soft teddy bear except for luke But thats what tech nerds are stereotypically anyways
This 4090 looks sick
Pretty soon everything will be installed on the GPU
Somebody should make GPUs in the ATX motherboard form factor and then start making little add on motherboards that fit in the PCIe card dimensions
That's not even funny anymore xd what's next gpu with integrated psu and Mobo and no case needed
Graphics cards are getting ao thick so you dont have to buy a new one every time a new generation comes out
lmao face with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughingloudly crying face
This aint it
The gpu she told you not to worry about
OMG look at the thick power hungry and expensive as fuxk GPU
lol what Is this real
To be honest the CPU is missing its heat sink
Honestly it would be pretty cool to setup the ITX board on top of the GPU You have the room put some mini stands wrap the PCI cable and place the sfx psu on the second half of the GPU It'll be pretty compact
I mean it wasn't much different from some chunky 3080 90 and even if you place an ATX Mobo there it would still look comical They are just long boiz Keep in mind the release of 30 6000 series even made a few mid tower ATX cases incompatible with GPUs which really is something if you think about it
Well now we're just being silly haha
This is what peak ITX looks like
New portable heater up to 500 W with aftermarket cards I guess Perfect for the coming winter
is that actually a 4090
Only a matter of time until GPUs just become a whole SoC
has science gone too far
just go all in and put motherboard mounting studs in the gpu
Godam I know that it's mostly cooling that makes gpus so massive but godam the majority of a system with a 4090 will be the gpu now
lol
Same image
Looks like my system Itx board with a 3090 and nhd15 Can't even see the motherboard
cant wait to get a 4090
My kind of system
it looks like a shotgun
Honestly what are the current specs on this photo
Dude predicted some of this over a 1 5 years ago lol v 0frNP0qzxQc
At this rate they might as well put the rest of the mobo on the gpu Like just add ram and a cpu Would be funny if they came pinned for amd or intel cpus
Butterfly on horse cock
the 4090 is so big that you need to install all the other parts onto IT
ITX mobo on 4090 or 4090 giving sustenance to ITX mobo thinking face
I dont understand anything People are acting as if the new GPU is the size of a car
Omfg This baby will sell a lot ROG
But which itx case will fit this
Custom acrylic would do wonders
gigabyte aorus 40 series card might be 5 slots thick
This is a meme lol
Pretty sure the gpu can be called the true motherboard here The motherboard is just an accessory attached to the gpu rather than gpu attached to
That s what it really means by discrete graphic card
Would literally melt the boardface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
RTX 10090 a huge fridge side GPU Needed 20k W Yes you need to cell your kidneys and if possible one eye ball and might be your soul for that pc
Now we just wait for GPU with integrated PC
Joke's on you the 6090 is going to be an integrated PSU Motherboard unit that you slot your other components into
The volume of a 4090 FE is 2 8L on its own I built my mom an APU system in a 2 7L case
You can install Windows12 into the VRAM of the graphics card
Not probably definitely Would just need mounting options engineering
That will also keep your hands warm in a cold winter Brilliant
Car
In that case the 7090 will function as my car
They are all just circuit boards
haha
They have their own linus now
Oh god I felt that
Asian Jim Linus
I saw it coming and my intuition never fails
ATX case standards set some limits Intel and AMD boards have their own safe areas for CPU coolers also defined Also when things go large there are limits how many kilos of copper you can bolt on In general there is a point where adding more just doesn't work well and it is better to go with a waterpump and a separate radiator Frankly personally starting to look at MO RA3 as more and more sane option these days Can get away with a lot smaller case with tiny waterblocks and ther just routing the problem out of the case completely Only thing I worry about a bit is the whole mess of wiring the pump and the fans for it seems like bit of an arts and crafts project to get the extensions and make the cabling work out nicely in addition to the waterloop tubes
Non standard video card form factors 107mm But like everything else with the pci formfactor dimensions wise it's more of a guideline than a rule like 3 slot cards probably aren't perfectly spec compliant either
yes and it's just a bit taller than the slot bracket gpu manufacturers have been ignoring this for a long time
Is there a spec limitation for how tall a GPU can be Don't worry v 0frNP0qzxQc t 116s
The motherboard sag
Gonna need gpu braces
I had to 3d print a jack stand for my 3060 and that ain't got shit on this beast
I heard they are working with cars maybe for 7090 the gpu is build in a car you can play gta6 while you are driving
No but they are petty enough to start throttling crypto hash rates at a hardware level on their cards Talk about next level pettiness
It does with a waterblock
Of course it does ATX mainboards extend towards the other side
This one in particular probably wouldn't fit most ITX cases but there'll definitely be ones that work fine or better than the 3080 90 There are heaps of deshrouded builds auto webp s 7d42dc928447beb914ab044d633b83365ffa798e where width 4032 format pjpg auto webp s ece039fccce43acb3c778cf602dc336af12f92fd you can cool the heatsink directly with outside air using 120mm fans which improves the temperatures and noise In fact thicker heatsinks would be even better as you could skip using spacers or ducts
I have an nr200p with a 3080ti peaking at 72c on the gpu and 65c on my 5600x arctic lf2 The 3090 ran even cooler at 67C owing to its gigantic cooler ITX makes a LOT of sense if you buy the right case for your needs
This is fitting the NR200
Go vertical gpu if possible Case looks real empty without the bottom filled
unfortunately with how much juice these things suck down huge heatsinks are the only way to can cool them on air i agree though just aesthetically speaking anything over 2 5 slots looks straight up comical imo
ok at MO RA3 as more and more sane option these days Can get away with a lot smaller case with tiny waterblocks and ther just routing the problem out You got me there
They need a premium water cooled version to rip your money
The 3080 Ti FE does hit 350w stock It runs fine on my SF600 Platinum on a 5900x in a NR200P
Si senoir
Doesn t the NR200 support up to 335mm cards I mean I ve tried to fit a Taichi 6800 XT and gave up 30 secs into it but it s supposed to work
It's confirmed that it fits the reference card which is thicker but shorter
Like my girl
And then when one part fails you have to buy it all again Nice
Because it is More than half of people will have to replace their power supplies and cases something many of us have not had to replace for years It doesnt even fit in mid sized cases
That doesn't sound like a bad idea tbh
so a prebuilt of sorts built by nvidia sounds reasonable
The NForce motherboard returns With an AMD Cpu again as well
Jokes on you the 9090 is going to be an integrated CASE PSU GPU CPU MOBO unit that you plug into the power grid
I would actually appreciate plugging my GPU directly into the mains rather than overworking my PSU
That's just a game console with extra steps
Basically a laptop
Look at me look at me I am the motherboard now
Stop giving them ideas
I don t understand why they aren t already doing this it s be even more capitalistic
It'll be a Fatherboard
It's also the entire cabinet
Can t wait for a seperate wall plug just for the GPU
I read that as lakh and facepalm
DeskMini gang
Can't no TPM
are you kidding it'll keep half the house warm at idle
Correction it ll burn your hands into oblivion and take away all feeling you ever had in them
And 14180 will function as generator for my house
You're a circuit board
And the table
I've gone from watercooling back to air cooling just for long term troublefree reliability and low maintenance You can fit a pretty beefy CPU air cooler even in small form factor cases as long as you don't go for the smallest options The GPUs are starting to be more of a problem where I would prefer if we could just get something that accepts standard 120 or 140mm fans for low noise so you don't have to rip out a shroud and try to figure out how to ziptie some actually good fans to it just to get things less noisy
I use a single 480 ext rad mounted on a liquidhaus stand Easily cools cpu and a 3090 Used to cool 2 3090s
It's not about adding more thermal mass it's about how the form factor of gpus is pretty terrible for cooling
Dental Plan
That's basically a Tesla lol
The car will be built into the gpu
Very true
Soon you will need an ice block
and with compact designs
The case must fit the card anyway so there is space available in the side And and more becoming more often there is space required anyway Am I missing something
what case is this
I have a NR200P myself The case is amazing But it will be complicated to impossible if the graphics card grows significantly over three slots And the NR200P can already fit a few MicroATX boards
I ve had some less than pleasant experiences with PCIe risers in my current build so I m wary of using one again I d prefer to keep things as simple as possible I won t be seeing inside my case anyway I specifically bought one with a steel side panel because I don t want to deal with glass
Then just sell the board without any cooling parts and people can build their own water cooled GPU It would be really efficient as the heatsink frame and fans cost will be cut to 0
This card is 357mm
I a aged to get my 3070 FTW 3 card into it but anything taller or fatter isn t working with the fans and aio installed
The PC market will have to come to terms with it or Apple will have an increasingly insurmountable advantage The motherboard of today has had many historical pieces integrated into the CPU For the most part I upgrade my motherboard when I get a new cpu anyway I don t upgrade my CPU often enough to benefit from being able to use the same socket or ram or ssd or video card It will obviously be an adjustment for people who like to upgrade piecemeal
I mean come on the RTX 4090 is just 4x larger than mATX motherboard and needs a 1200W PSU Its not like energy prices is very expensive nowadays S bro
I wouldn't be surprised if it's the future of PC's tbf whole computer units built onto a big GPU
Except that completely defeats the idea of building your own system That would just make it a pre built I actually prefer the idea of making the video card more modular Make it with vram slots so you can choose how much you want Imagine a 4080 that you could expand the vram to 32gb with 2x16gb vram chips Design the whole card so its like a motherboard and customizable Including heatsink and fans and even eventually the graphics processor itself
And you can drive it home
sounds reasonable Until you see the price tag they'd probably slap on these things
I CAN'T PAAAY ELECTRIC BIIIIILL BLAM
No more pre built than buying a mobo now and calling it pre built You'd still have to buy the other parts and attach them It's not really a pre built unless it comes fully assembled
I remember these boards god what a relic from an era not long in the past
ahh the good ol days abit kn8 sli opteron 146 later 3800x2 and 7900gt pencil volt modded sli goodness
That plugs you into the power grid
Windows 12 will need a DNA sample as a requirement
It ll be a GPU Furnace combo Your family complaining that the house is getting cold during the winter Fire up cod and headshot your way to a nice and cozy 78F in minutes
The 6090 eliminates the need for a house entirely because you can simply live inside it
I'm an organic abacus
No I'm a redditor who isn't the slightest bit interested in the 40 series you're a circuit board
I agree but the sheer size of the GPU air coolers and the potential future hilarity 800W point towards water becoming interesting again as it allows moving the problem out of the case Building mass farm of rads inside the case with complicated piping on the other hand seems less and less enticing The issue is that 450W GPUs kinda need more than a single 360mm rad to cool on water And CPUs hitting 200W also needing a 360mm rad to keep cool without massive fan how do I put 3x360mm rad in this case mess Moving all that to outside using MO RA3 makes water just so much simpler Just put QDs outside the PCI bracket passthru so you can unplug the whole rad pump assembly so effectively inside the computer you have a PCI bracket that has two tubes thru it one goes to CPU block from CPU block to GPU block and back out to the bracket Simple clean tubing very short runs minimal amount of fittings to minimize leak and as it appears to be single sided no RAM on the backside is likely as new larger chips exist just like 3090ti that also makes it simple Only problem is that you end up effectively two boxes the PC case and then the rad fan pump assembly which would be almost as large D
The PC industry needs more creativity Simply using the inheritance of the AT standard is just awful
That's what modding is all about
Yes once you take the rad out of the case and there is nothing to stop the airflow thru it it can do a lot better But if you go that far to have external rad not a big jump to just go full stupid for MO RA3 and ensure it'll handle anything Leather Jacket Man can throw at it
Tesla uses AMD APUs
A frozen CO 2 block
The smaller SFF cases are sandwich style cases with a riser Check out r sffpc to see some builds You can squeeze 3 slot GPUs in under 10l with a 240 mm rad in cases like a T1 V2
The fact the powersupply usually sits in that negative space
Minisforum has entered the chat
coolermaster nr200p
NR200 I wouldn't use that case I had it before and my components were cooking ssupd meshlicious is the way to go
Wonder if an nr200p max can handle it Edit 4090 is 61mm nr200p max can handle 75mm
Good call lol
Then how do they rip more money from you some of the premium GPU with aio water cooler or huge heat sink could cost couple hundreds dollar more than the cheapest version
Sure but then be really ready to shell out 5 grand for GPU barebone systems More proprietary tech closed down ecosystems and solely controlled supply chains I'd rather hope for a polyopoly
For better or worse the future of PCs is going to be cluster on a chip solutions like what apple's doing now
Add a screen battery keyboard and touchpad and you have got a laptop
I wouldn't be surprised if it's the future of PC's tbf whole computer units built onto a big GPU Actually I have a feeling the future of PCs are actually thin clients Basically rented computer time like back in the day Why pay so much for hardware you use every now and then that you have to maintain Instead just rent it and stream it I know that is somewhat controversial especially when it comes to games and input latency However we are rapidly heading that way with more acceptance for services like Geforce Now or xCloud increasing access to faster networks and game engines probably being tailored for cloud based gaming It won't be in the next 5 years but maybe 10 15 years
I think the real long term future of this is all cloud computing PC's 15 years from now could mostly be dumb terminals I don't like that but I think that's where we're going I think game consoles will get there first I hope I'm wrong
Playstation 7
And put in a little box and called a console
Return to the old days when we actually Could upgrade the memory on our graphics cards TBH I'd be really happy if we could go back to that
VRAM bandwidth and signal integrity is way too important to a modern GPU to have it be anything other than soldered
Design it like a CPU with a separate motherboard socket and ram slots
Soon the part number will be the price RTX 5090 Easy to remember at least
It's gonna be over 9000 for sure
EVGA AIO with solar panel attachment RIP EVGA
Heh mr ceilingbrains here
Yes I had one I know my first pc I built was an amd 1 0GHz but a jumper to go to 1 33GHz And I know I made one after that as well so I cant recall which was Nforce but onboard gpu you could actually use and play games with
I remember reading about pencil mods but wasnt looking to do that kind of craziness back then With cost of stuff now I was deathly afraid during a thermal pad swap on a 3090
Heat the swimming pool year round
I wonder if that's actually possible just hooking up your PCs exhaust into the HVAC system
Negative I am a meat popsicle
Yeah that's like my friends going to a LAN party with their external SCSI box in the end of the '90s
Yeah exactly you could have a SFF size computer on your desk cooled by an ATX case size radiator under it
Sounds like one of those air conditioners with the intake radiator outside the window with the actual AC being inside
What boggles my brain is that there are still PS 2 connectors on modern backplates
Hah true I just thought mora 3 was pricey but i admit its not something ive looked up in some time
Damn any recommendations ITX size for my current config Thinking of going 4090 4080 and the new AMD chips with a 280mm rad
Well that sucks but wouldn't it be beneficial for them too if they sell the board itself without cooling
More proprietary tech closed down ecosystems and solely controlled supply chains This is Apple
polyopoly That's a new fun word to say for me
If companies can profit off the lock in they'll do it in a heartbeat And what you're talking about is already how laptops work Except maybe Framework but it's overpriced to begin with
It's already 6 grand CAD to build a proper system with a 4090 these days I think I'm at the point now that I've just accepted everything is way more expensive now and I need to keep pushing on and keep finding ways to increase income wealth to keep pace
They said this before sun tried to do it twenty years ago
And then we tied onions to our belts as was the fashion at the time
Xzibit is watching this thread with great interest
The GPU could have it's own PCIe root complex Then we can plug in NVMe storage to the GPU for texture cache
People are jumping ship It s a wild time right now
lmaoooo dragonball z DDD
I remember my uncle would use a pencil to draw a carbon trace on his CPU to unlock more horaepower haha
I was shitting bricks using the copper plate mod from massive difference in in my opinion easier to change than thermal pads pencil mod was a bit easier on the soul then a 7900gt was only around 350 400 if I recall correctly
i ll show you meat popsicle
Extreme MO RA3 setup is to put the rad outside the room Granted this introduces potential problems related to condensation if the rad is in an environment that is well below the room temperature and potential issues related to outright freezing coolant I wouldn't go quite that far Yet
There are lots of reasons PS 2 is lower latency than USB due to the fact it sends instructions directly to the CPU USB is polled by the CPU so if it's not looking it's not processing an instruction PS 2 has true N key rollover if you palm smashed your PS 2 keyboard EVERY key press registers USB keyboards can't do that PS 2 devices work at a hardware level so they will always work USB devices work at a driver level meaning if your OS drivers get screwed up or you don't enable the ability for the BIOS to recognize a USB keyboard you won't be able to control the machine Not saying everything is rosy The biggest drawback is they aren't hot swappable and you can damage your MOBO by not plugging PS 2 devices in when the machine is off
Isn t the 4090 4 slot If yes I don t know what itx case will fit it other than the Sliger cases Those are pretty expensive too
They probably can't due to legal implications
Minus the 500 Watt electric furnace though
They said this before sun tried to do it twenty years ago Sure You know what came before the first iPhone launch in June 2007 Windows Mobile 2003 I'm almost certain there might even be other smart phone devices even before that Today that option already exist for productivity like Azure Virtual Desktop There is a good chance this will all be completely managed in the near future
This made me laugh a lot
Yea I was mining eth for a little bit and the pad mod didnt bring temps down much But I read afterwards about squeezing the heatsink on better when screwing it on which I didnt do So one day maybe Ill do that But same with coolmygpu Looked good but I knew eth was about to dry up So I stopped and went to an undervolt
Huh Crazy Wonder why it never took off
Ah i ll note that down any suggestions for the smaller 4080
Not going to happen unless there is a significant improvement in network infrastructure There are still large parts of the USA on DSL speeds
PS2 was the standard back in the day as far as I remember which isn't that far since I was born in the mid 90s Everything switched to USB in the mid 2000s I think Give or take a few years I'm still using my IBM Model M with the PS2 connector Good keyboard
I remember when people used to say that about Netflix too Point is demand will spur improvement and improvement will spur demand There is nothing that prevents this from living side by side and eventually the majority is on this See digital games adoption vs physical
Brace yourselves GPU on car seat posts incoming
Nvidia looking at this where is all the dumb c that said no one gonna be buying 4090 at 1600 dollars
Woah And I thought showing up 30min before opening was
as a former micro center tustin employee i sincerely wish that every single one of you would go home
Here we go again
Funny I was at the MN microcenter about 30 minutes before close and not a single camper in sight
Well that's depressing but not unexpected Nvidia could've charged 2 400 for this thing and people would still be lining up like this
Wow people are rich af or maybe I am tooo poor
What recession
We've got 5 4090s Microcenter probably
And this is why nvidia does what nvidia does smh
Nice try Jensen we all know they're really there for Intel's cards
Half scalpers half enthusiasts and rest are folks from reddit bitching about the price
How many of them are scalpers
I get it like its a fast GPU demolishes 4K But this basically just gives Nvidia the green light
Not sure if tent person is camping in line or just one of the 200 000 homeless Californians thinking face
Consumers are a joke and we deserve everything Nvidia and their peers do to us
Dang more people than I expected for this launch hope retailers have as much stock as they are rumored to lol
nauseated face
Very soon they will be lining up for the 2000 5090 in 2 years from now These people are the reason why Nvidia thinks everyone is loaded with cash
Won't be surprised if at least half of those people already have 3080 3090 class of cards already in their PCs But gotta upgrade every generation whilst Jensen laughs like Agent Smith witnessing this
How many of them do you wanna bet are scalpers
Cringe
genuinely stock won't even be a problem and they're probably gonna limit people to buying a set amount of cards so if they're hoping to make money scalping they're wasting their time especially when scalping i'm so confident will just be an immense waste of time and money this generation lol
Lol WTF Here am I thinking I'll just casually go there on my lunch break Yeah no thanks
I walked into a Microcenter 3 hours after opening they still have plenty of stock 4 different brands
I sure don t miss the 3090 launch from when I released I went and stayed at Microcenter for more than 30 hours and ended up with nothing They only had 30 cards I doubt there will be a shortage of these things
You guys still have money
I'm a serious nerd who saves money for big hardware purchases and can afford this but I don't need a 4090 for anything right now so likely a pass But I never understood the whole going out and sitting in front of a shop for hours days like this Why not just do that online and stay at home comfortably doing nerd stuff while waiting Or working even wtf I guess it's a social thing which is not my area of expertise But also it's a USA thing it seems slow unreliable deliveries in some places maybe this didn't happen for Ampere in Europe and it's not happening now either It's all been happening online for many years
I realize this means the last of the childhood joy has exited my withered and failing body but imagine camping overnight for something you ll be able to buy from your desk chair at home in 2 weeks
What recession
Not only can they afford the 4090 they can afford to spend an entire night outside with their fancy tents and umbrellas Suck it down haters
They all game at 4K right More like scalping in 4K
These aren't customers these are likely mostly scalpers look at Ebay there are already hundreds of 4090's listed for 2 3x over MSRP These are the douches that ruin the chance for anyone to get them at retail Just capitalism at its finest
Sad in most
Wish best buy did this than online only I had no chance
I showed up to the Tustin location this morning at 4 30 and saw this line extend to the street and just went home and got it on Newegg
Man great for the folks sitting there in those seats Nothing to do but wait for their new card grinning face with smiling eyes It will feel like an accomplishment if they get one Don t have the time to sit there myself but passion is never a bad display
Reddit the most out of touch social network on the internet despite thinking it s the most representative
I'm embarrassed just looking at this
Most of these people are probably scalpers
Lol they are queuing up from the night till dawn to buy this card What is their use case for 4090 Nvidia wins hands down
I was gonna go in the morning just to get new fans so I hope that it s not too bad by the time I get there
Looks like there is still enough rich idiots left in world
Ugh That's the Tustin near me Glad I didn't decide to try that shit My gf called me crazy for even thinking about camping out I'm gonna wake up in the morning and see if I can nab one online If not I'll wait a couple weeks months No way there's a complete shortage like last time My bet is a lot of these guys are scalpers attempting to make a quick profit on stupid people before restock hits
And i bet half of them are gonna be using with 1440p displays lol
Yup times are really thought this days Nobody is going to camp for the next Nvidia card
Damn these scalpers sure are dedicated
God damn we need another Microcenter out here in the LA basin I would go to MC more often if they open one in LA county
Betting now that some of these are scalpers Cards on launch are always sold out but I think these ones will be hugely available after a couple of weeks and I hope they will be a failure for nVidia
lol those are all resellers
Those are clearly scalpers trying to make quick buck lol
Fuck How am I supposed to get one now
Wow Dallas location has 50 people here 150 cards on hand
More like and the scalping begins
Are we gonna get the scalper bullcrap again with the 4000 series What a nightmare that was for the 3000 series As well as the PS5 and X Box Series X S
Austin Evans is here now guys OMG how exciting s
no waiting line in France you can just walk in and get one
I work at a micro center there was a line Higher ups were busting our asses to make everything clean enough to do surgery on When they were allowed in 2 hours early the first civilian to get his eyes on a 4090 I swear to God first words out of his mouth were That s it They said it was a big box that s not big at all I just walked away because I m warehouse and don t have to be around that negativity I feel sorry for the sales people lol
Everyone in this photo is setting up their auctions
Got mine at mayfield heights Tuf 4090 OC
I don t get it It is not that serious A 3090 Ti is pretty much top tier already
Meanwhile my MC still has 4090s in stock 4 hours after opening
I wish them high frame rates and cool temps
Wondering if this will run Crysis Asking for a friend
This is kind of sad and pathetic
This is just depressing
9 10 are shithead amazon businessmen scalpers
This again comes to prove that many people have more money than brain
Death taxes and idiots never ending cycle of life
I thought they all said we aint buying the 40 series rolling on the floor laughing
No pussy for miles
nice
This is hilarious
Jensen could sell anything to these lot
Got a Strix off newegg Couldn't get suprim liquid
And this is why Nvidia will keep pulling the stupid shit that it does Because people are stupid enough to do this
People lined up to spend 1600 on a GPU Now I've seen everything
OMG what a zoo I was thinking of going in the morning lol No way im waiting in line for that lol
The fact redditors were saying this release will be different They won't sell out instantly has me laughing my ass off
Sausage fest
so overall all lines combine for the few mc would be 3 lines at the largest best buys location in usa
Ahh good ole memories from the pandemic
I have a 3090 upgraded from 1080ti I'll probably hold onto my 3090 until the 6 7 series comes out
Scalpers at it again
All I cna say is I sure hope those people game at 4k Super I pressive card but at anything less than 4k it's not going to stretch its legs
Just couldn't be me Not for no GPU haha Good luck to everyone there however
Bwahahahaha Look at all the scalpers lining up to hurry and make a quick buck
Why people are camping Nvidia has truck load gpus store for 4000 series
Cant wait for the Its not much but its mine posts
This is actually very sad
Oh cool So this is what getting priced out of my hobby looks like
Wowwwee No wonder prices just keep going up and up there's always some dumb suckers ruining everything for the rest of us willing to pay whatever arbitrarily high price is demanded
I m seeing this 9h after you posted this Good luck
This is why I gave up on PC gaming Too damn expensive
Well I got one online Slept in my bed all night too
A lot of people making the comments about being too much beef for most peoples needs aren't addressing buyers who might want one for rendering purposes Never enough beef and the workstation card isn't gonna be cheap The benchmarks for rendering in Cycles and chaos and such are just amazing I cry looking at the Cycles 3 3 benches as a R9 390 user I can't even fathom what it does My POS 390 isn't even on the charts on techgage this things doing in 38 seconds what my card does in probably double the time the worst card does That's fucking sick I want it I want it in me
I just walked in this morning to my microcenter and bought a Asus Tuf OC 4090 They had plenty of cards all different models No line outside You would pick whichever you want they'd give you a paper for it then go wait at check out and they bring it to you LOTS of people were there The line at check out was 2 isles long It would move but it would constantly fill up as people checked out
The opiod epidemic is out of hand can't even go to microplay without navigating tent city at
i wonder how Meany people left with a 30 series card instead of a 40 series card cause aint no way I'm standing in a long line and not leave with something
Damn even our Lord GabeN himself is camped out right in front for the 4090
I walked into my microcenter at 11am and just bought a card off the
Not that surprising considering people were buying 3070's and 3080's for 2000 roughly 2 years ago
Wait a couple of weeks for the initial demand to die down from gamers and scalpers I'm sure it's not like the crypto days where u need to compete with them
Completely sold out everywhere in the UK within minutes of launch Retailers are not taking pre orders
Does this mean I can finally find a 3090 at a reasonable price now
Sad
Is it really worth it
Lol wow my microcenter didn t sell out
I just barely bought a new 1660 Super It'll be a few years before I get a 30 series at this rate
There goes my chances of getting one
Nobody gonna buy them bro Ahahahahahaha nvidia wins again rtx 4070 for 699 and next gen probably starts at 899 for a 4060
Stock isn't a problem Zotac cards been up on Amazon for literal hours
holy shit really
There s more than the 3000 series and the card is 1600 it s not gonna be that bad
So much for not buying the card
Legit 10 minutes away but will probably try for a FE on bestbuy or nvidia directly
Imagine standing in line to buy a gpu
nvidia simps
This thread is pure cope
I honestly wouldn't worry much about this These are the FOMO and GOTTA HAVE IT folks These GPUs could be 10 000 and people would still camp out The true market test will be the weeks following launch We'll see if these prices actually have any staying power
This is why Nvidia can charge whatever they want Affordable high end gaming is doomed
Dumbasses
I can't imagine ever sitting outside in a chair or tent for hours waiting for a store to open to be able to give 1600 of my money to get a product from a billion dollar corporation
Oh look The exact same reason I wasn't able to afford a 3000 series card or even get one at all I'm glad you're happy with waiting but this is one of the main reasons cards are so pricey and hard to find Contribution to the cause
Not a girl in sight lol
Oh come on WTF is wrong with people It s freakin video card Go home or go out and meet some people but standing around at Micro Center in the dark so you can buy a video card or any computer component or consumer electronics is just sad Freakin redonkulous
Who are these people Ready to spend 1600usd on a whim I am pretty sure most of them might be running 3090ti 3090 I dont get it why to upgrade this quickly
look at all these scalpers
Im in line here at microcenter Waiting to buy at least 8 to mine ETH
idiots
Im extremely dissapointed in all of you Don t be surprised if the 5090 costs more than 3000 usd now Basically few days ago you were all claiming you wouldn t buy this product to give nvidia a red light Now you are once again just throwing all to dust and give nvidia what they want again Dissapointing
People here mad they cant afford it lol face with tears of joy bozos
I thought Microcenter was doing a lottery so you can show up in the AM enter the lottery to get a chance to buy one Unless this store isn't doing that
I don't think there is going to be a 4090 supply issue Unless these people are just excited to get one People got money during the pandemic and had nowhere to go and not a lot to do so the demand got very high for GPUs compound that with factories in Tiwan not being able to work at full capacity because of COVID and the crypto stuff it made supply short with a higher than usual demand We shouldn't see those problems this generation Hopfully
Buncha loser cunts Jk they have every right to spend their money however they want despite how angry people are here Vote with your wallet Time for some spicy memes and first 4090 posts to come lol
Damn this is bad news for me wonder at what price tag entry level for 4000 series will be
I don t always stereotype but I see scalpers in the midst
this card won't sell picture proving otherwise i mean uurrrmm we won't know for a few weeks reddit copium is real
Morons
Queue overnight for easy 1000 profit on eBay Those 4090 will end up selling at eBay for 3000 onwards
I m sorry you guys seriously expected everyone to boycott the 4090 Do you guys think everyone on the sub is a representative of everyone
This is only in USA moment Really pathetic man facepalming
Where are all the pitchforks about GPU miners
Got a Tuf oc at cambridge microcenter this morning about 60 people in queue 100 cards mixed gigashyte asus msi scrotac
This was cool for a game and game consoles when there isn t a shortage Used to be parties This is just sad fools waiting in a capitalist line
why people love lines just wait and buy it online jesus christ
This is just depressing Even more so in Cali where prices are exorbitant for a piece of gum
Y all are stupid camping out
What a joke
I wish I had enough money to buy a 4090 and spend all night camping out waiting for it
Nice If I could afford it I'd be out there too
All reseller scum lol
So many salty people in these comments If people can afford it and they want to queue up then who cares
They did the most important thing they bought something They bought something with money God I love money so much Merchandise their only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise They did it they went into an honest to God store and they bought something They didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints they just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said Yes daddy please and I'm so proud of them I only wish they could have bought give Grandpa a kiss lips if you want whatever you're comfortable oh ffs no Rick and Morty fans
This is why Nvidia is riding us silly with this gen There are just so many clowns out there that will just bend over for whatever price Nvidia gives them There's just too many idiots out there We're fucked
America moment
The GPU market gets ruined because of idiots like you
I mean sure its 1600 dollars but the price per performance is pretty good And i would guess that many of the people buying cards are not angry keyboard warriors typing on reddit
I hate the fact that I have to utter these the 4090 is actually damn good value I can see why someone is tempted to get this card but I personally think it's way to damn expensive
I swear these things only happen in America
Fucking shills
These be the same people complaining about inflation yet they magically have 1 600 lying around for a graphic card
They all probably just want FE cards Jokes on them when they realize they only got 5 total
I wouldn t be surprised if most of those people were being paid as some sort of marketing ploy
all of them are scalpers lol
ROFL All you salty ppl getting pissed at someone else for buying a GPU
What is the appeal
Take a picture when you get yours bro
Just to play WOW in 4K
Dumbasses
This is a problem and reason why cards cost what they cost Now that it s launched it sold out instantly everywhere People love blaming the corporations but WE are the problem
Thanks for solidifying Nvidia s pricing
Bunch of idiots lmao
I never understood why you would wait in line for hours to buy something I haven't ever wanted anything so much that I would camp out for I'm trying to think of what's the most special that I own I think it would have been my motorcycle
Content creators everywhere
24 people in this parking lot whoa looks like a bunch of scalpers
My people FPS Junkies
That s 67 bucks per month for 2 years till the 5099 comes out Pretty bloody affordable if you ask me
Idiots
I mean the 4090 is actually good value compared to the 3090 or 3090ti It's the 4080 pricing and performance that leaves a lot to be desired
Scalpers I bet a percentage of these people are scalpers Makes me sick
Really hope that AMD releases a flagship with similar performance for half the price just to fuck with the market a bit and to wake up all those people 1600 is insane for a graphics card And let's really hope there will be no scalping issues this time
I can t believe people are spending their money on this It s your money go off but like Jesus between the prices and the power cost and the crypto economy I can t see a reason to justify it
I wager that the scalping price of a 4090 FE post launch will be 4K
Not this shit again Fuck that noise
So fucking stupid
Guys get a life come on
There's still 6 4090s in microcenter Houston I think they opened earlier too
Man you think a food truck would see an opportunity
Very happy with my 2080 See 0 reason to buy into this Gen I'll wait for 6000 series
Nerds have lined up
Thanks to the moron scalpers that bought the ROG Strix and posted it online for 3k I got a TUF OC and you saved me 200 I also didn't wait in line all night I slept and got there at 4 AM
And this is why companies will continue to raise prices People still line up to get it without Vaseline
Fools and their money are easily parted
YouTube influence wannabees early adopters and scalp this card when so you can buy a 3080 Strix on Amazon Prime day for 1 2 the price Besides you know you are all just surfing porn and playing games from 10 years ago anyway that is what I do with my 3090
WTF are there that many people with PC setups good enough I mean they must have good PCs to put them in right or is it scalpers
I cannot fathom doing something as stupid as this
Must be nice
Losers
This is why companies like Nvidia will never change All the noise in the world doesn't matter when consumers are still showing up en mass to purchase the product These companies only look at quarterly reports and sales numbers reinforce their way of thinking They couldn't care less about what anybody is saying because money talks much more loudly
But why these were easily available at Amazon
I can't wait to bully every single one of them
I m typically the kind of person to buy the latest flagship cause why not but these 4000 s look appalling in every way imo Terrible price insane power consumption likely thermal nightmares and horrific ugly aib designs I genuinely can t think of a single valid reason to buy one and I ve tried
Look how stupid I am everyyone All these consoomers just ready to be fleeced Literally a perfect picture of why Nvidia will keep up their greedy practices
They're not just waiting for the 4080 they're also gonna live on the street once they spend all their money
Morons all of them
So GPU shortage wasn't entirely contributed by miners To think there would be people stupid enough to line up for this crap
Why are Americans so pathetic Honestly how little do you have going on in your life that you're camping out in front of stores to buy fkn electronics I'm going to assume all the downvotes are coming from sad lil neckbeards
all of these people are either incels or their wife has a boyfriend there s no in between
Are they doing the whole scan QR code and randomly picking
I hope these are all stupid scalpers getting ready to be burned Because the alternative is just fucking
Why would you line up for this In Germany i could just order one for MSRP right now and have it delivered tomorrow
Tragic grimacing face
Tragic grimacing face
I don't really understand why people are going for 4090 over 4080 or even a lower model Is it just because people want both 4K and high refresh rates at the very maximum settings in every game I have a 3060 and play Assetto Corsa Competizione at 1440p with optimized high max settings and get a solid fps lock at 100 I sort of want a 3070 for more headroom and thus lower render latency but I couldn't imagine getting a 3090 unless I was rich
To each their own but I just woke up from a healthy full night of sleep in my bed sipping on tea and relaxing to morning radio having just traded in a not yet opened discounted RTX 3080 Ti for an even more discounted and new RTX 3090 I bought and received within 24 hours at the simple click of a button I look forward to doing the same with a graphics card at least as good as the one they're camping out for at a fraction of the price years from now when my 3090 is actually legitimately unfeasible for the gaming workloads I'll likely throw at it
Bloody hell 2200 for a GPU Have we all gone mad
Pathetic honestly
Jensen rubbing his hand atm
yo is that the dude from LTT dead center
Isn t this the one that s been melting PCs
Damn I really thought this release would be a dud or at least a normal release like the old 360 ps3 era days where there was hype to get them quick instead of ensuring you get one at all Even Best Buy is already sold out completely
And it's raining and thundering
just got into microcenter befor work look what i found posts
Rebranding Titan to xx90 is easily the most profitable marketing decision Nvidia has ever made
Must half a million dollars lining up
At least it isnt long lines like the MW2 night release
I thought we werent buyin this one
Sat with fingers crossed that they are not shite so my Nvidia shares will stop tanking upside down face
Weird I did the same and got denied every single time Kinda frustrating
Was a storm in Chicago wonder if they sat in the rain all night like idiots
Brace yourselves GPU on car seat posts incoming in almost 9 h x200B x200B x200B i wait for 7090
This will make me happy
Lol
Gaben
thats a whole lotta wealthy people
This picture is the embodiment of sad
This Is really annoying to watch
Suckers lol
Think of the smell you bitch
As someone who owns a you don't need a 4090 No game that has been released currently or will be released in the next few years needs a 4090 It's too much Even if you can argue it's not too much power it's not worth over 1000 to play a single video game that's meh at like an extra 15 frames per second I learned this the hard way I'm foreseeing a lot of regret in that picture within a year
OK why so much demand Hardly they all need this gpu at this price Why not get it a bit later once it comes down in price
I wonder how many of these people won t even be able to get it into their cases much less have a psu steering enough to push it lol Is there any data on how much monthly Eletric charges increase adding this to your rig
Most of them must be streamers youtube creators who didn't get it from Nvidia
Scalpers aren't going to get much After paying ridiculous California taxes ebay shipping fees they'll be lucky to make 150 They also get reported to the IRS
You re all sheep I m not giving Nvidia any money Greedy company
What do they get from getting it early This doesn t make any sense There not going to be a shortage there s not going to be skalping and getting it on release does what exactly I d understand if it were a game or new tech But when it s to replace existing tech that works exactly the same other than performance kinda sad
Wow glad to see pc is still shit Ty consoles
Not one girlfriend in sight Dude people still do this
And half these people probably using a 1080p monitor lmao
The latest gen of cards has a power connector that only has a 30 cycle lifetime and starts to melt after 2 5 hours of use Great job nvidia
non nerd here what are people camping out to buy
A clear sign that society is degrading It's not like it's food Taking off from work school to camp for a piece of overpriced electronics I for one am disappointed in humanity once more
Zero need to do this Just order it and have it shipped or hell just wake up at noon and grab one they will be in stock
Must be nice to live at home and be able to bank every dime you make at McDonalds for an entire year to buy one of these cards
This sub alternates so fast between THESE PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS I WILL NEVER BUY THEM The consumers won't put up with this anymore and they'll be forced to lower prices to I need this right now I can't wait to buy one
This may be misleading given current weather conditions
Looks like 20 guys got to be more cards then that
Hmmmm I can wait for the next restock I guess haha
Lol People camping out like they are going to have 100 in stock
Is there a possibility that the 4090 is going to be scalped again
There is already a line outside a microcenter the day before it comes out It's the 30 series launch all over again
I see this and I m like people are buying these edit trying to figure out how to edit my flair on iPhone That cpu is outdated
I thought the FE launches first And the FE is only availble at best buy no
Wow
Good luck Tam Best rep at micro center Tustin
Scalpers still alive
This is how you see most of Silicon Valley is moving to Texas
jeez
they're all tuning out the world lol
Half of them scalpers who are dreaming of massive profits They'll get wrecked when they find out cryptobros are gone and no one will pay a premium for these
I don't understand this Are these people scalpers
I ll wait to buy mine I m hoping I can sell my 3090 and get back some of what I paid for it
Microcenter is going to have to up their staff over the next couple weeks to handle all the returns
The only thing I was in line for were the Golden and Silver Mario Amiibo
Trust me guyz they re totally gonna have enough for everyone
Let's hope they can afford to pay thier mortgage rent and the increased energy costs in running it But I guess it's the same people that have to have the largest Apple product to keep thier social standards
I think many of them are scalpers just there to make a quick buck by reselling it
Oh no
That's just stupid like really stupid Chapter 58 of How to waste my time for real
Y all are the reason why nvidia charges what they charge But I hope you get your card regardless
And they're gone
OfferUp fixing to be full of 3500 4090s
Doesn't Microcenter do a raffle system now I remember when I went to buy a GPU with my friend you scanned a QR code they put out in the front and it's a raffle on who gets it That did a pretty good job at preventing people to camp overnight at my local Microcenter
Listen these people probably have had pcs for a while and been saving loot or only needed a graphics card I need a whole setup and been saving for six months now got 2 k saved gonna keep praying 3090 ti is cheaper
In Europe they cost 400 euros more than america so i highly doubt such scenes will be seen here
Doesn t seem too bad I only see like 40 50 people If stock is as good as they claim then there shouldn t be any issues
I'm waiting for pcbs 2 I don't have fucking money for that shit
Do we even know if the stock is short What if micro center has a metric fuckton and sells all of these people a card and are like ok next It would be cool if they could keep them on the shelves but my hopes aren t high
Lmfaooo everyone talking shit about them and they still camp out for it skullskull
enraged faceface with symbols on mouth
If I was American I'd camp too but in another countries prices are getting out of hand Just for one GPU price you can actually buy a decent high end setup Well congratz to new 4090 owners
I still have PTSD from waiting in line in 35 weather at a NYC microcenter in january for 8
Is there an expected bump in resales That s a lot of people eager to drop nearly 2k on a card
Probably same people that were there for 3090 c
So M
Not very promising for Nvidia to be honest there are 24 people waiting some of them will be with friends family So their big launch day opening at one of the biggest retailers in the country is selling 20 cards A casual search for 30 series queues shows hundreds of people There will always be idiots with more money than sense thankfully it seems like they're few and far between
Why not wait for the 9090ti It'll be so much better
i wonder how many of them were there for 30 series launch too lol
All these people going to be disappointed I
Spoiler no cards will be available at launch
Lol at these people
Probably last minute 3090ti regretful buyers
People are fucking retired
All those people just cannot wait to browse youtube all day on their new cards instead of playing video games
It is insane to see something like this given the state of our economy Don t think iPhone 14 launch saw something like this
How many do you figure are just there looking to flip on ebay Ever wonder if there's anything on this planet some people won't try to game Housing food video cards Not like this thing was in meaningful reach of people like me but it peppers my bunghole to know that my neighbour in this world would push it just a bit further out of reach so they can have just a little more of whatever they do not have enough of Feels weird to think that the Nah don't buy crowd was most likely just trying to ensure their own supply Anyone remember when a new GPU architecture came out that was considered a major technological leap like such It felt like Christmas Day everytime it happened and the fuckin cards weren't worth as much as pint of Bodacious' ball batter
Seriously people actually sleep outside waiting for theses new GPU's ive seen it all now Either they are really dumb and have no patience or they are scalpers ready to buy up all the new stock and sell them for terrible terrible prices on ebay
That s alot of people surprisingly enthusiastic to melt a power supply
Hey if you're getting a 4090 on launch day think about donating some GPU cycles to something like Sheepit help us poors render our 3D schlongdangles we putz with in Blender by acting as a big happy commie render farm Bonus heat your home Everybody wins
What s surprising me is how many people who have setups that would require a 4090 How many people have multiple 4K monitors they need to run The 4090 seems so overkill
Bag holders
I love how everyone is acting as if this is a massive amount of people Like there is maybe 30 people
Some people will sell their organs and take out a personal loan just to get a card I think that compared to the 30 series more people are taking it slow and waiting Not to mention that this picture doesn't show the lack of crypto mining sales If nVidia can't meet demand this time then you know they are artificially messing with supply
Oh hoho I know of at least 3 scalpers in line right now lol face with tears of joy gl everyone I m happy with a 3080
How ya holding up
Good The more that buy it the more 3XXXs they sell the more the price of those cards come down I'm on a 1080ti it still plays everything pretty well but struggling a bit now Jumping two gens to a 3090 will be worlds apart for me just need more of a price drop
I m laughing more at the fact that inventory is supposedly plentiful and this is completely unnecessary They have way more of the 4090 than the 3090 launch And there is no crypto boom
Does anyone else than the Americans do this
Imagine wasting money on the 40 series lol
I don't understand queueing for a release like this I might if it was the first GPU ever
This is sad
Looks like an old iPhone line Crazy
Thinking about checking my local microcenter but then I remember I have a 500w PSU and a 1080p UW monitor grinning face with sweat
Wait what
Slap it on the ol Mastercard eh
Lmao
I don't see any forklifts to carry those
Waiting for a 4090 so they can see their nude mods in 8k 60fps
Happy for these guys to get what they want but not happy for Nvidia to get what they want All I want is a 30 series card to fall into my budget
Panic ensued when management came out to address the crowd to line up People up front have been here since Monday night Stock is limited and over 250 People in line
All these people look just about as I expected them to
Bruh
Any word on how many they had The online launch was brutal
Tustin California experiences odd power outage due to unknown reasons
That's about 36k worth of customers outside of that Microcenter And that's just based of the 21 visible heads I counted in the
That GPU cost me more than damn near a full set of tires
lmao wow
Hahahaha what happened to all the claims on social media I'm good with my 3080 ti or too expensive no one wants this or your greed will cost you Nvidia
man they're gonna get so many frames on fortnite and rocket league
I got one from Newegg Glad that I didn't have to wait in front of a physical store for several hours
Some r pcgaming users No one is going to buy this it won't sell
Isn't this thing so overpowered that the cpu limits its performance
That building is actually the A C plant you need to cool it
Coon pod fanatics at play brace yourself
Hahaha hype mode again on face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
I'm just here to pay a low price for the cards they're discarding
Really George
what the fuck bro
That s not Tustin it s Santa Ana
You're delusional if you think launch wouldnt be like this I'm more interested in long term demand If it sticks then the baseline has moved and next gen will be even more stupid I would have bought one if I needed it but overwatch runs perfectly fine so pass until I play a game that my 3080 cant handle
Look i love micro center but the tustin one has absolutely got to be the worst shopping experience out of all the stores i went to Went to this location about 6 times only to have my online orders with wrong parts and wait literally an hour to get them to fix their own order Crazy long wait times to get something behind the counter and the website is never up to date for the most basic stock info Not even taking about gpus but fittings cases hard drives
All sold out in MC NY
Lol I live next to one and saw the line this am So dumb
There are lines for IPhones it's the same type of
But just imagine how much money these early adopters will make mining cyrpto Ha ha ha ha ha
MCs in Ohio showing in stock as of right now Can't imagine they had much of a line
just to play rocket league
In ebay 3300 for one I am buying a new motorcycle for this money lol
I'm more curious to know what card were these guys using before this one Are they the guys upgrading from the latest and greatest or were these guys running a 1080 2080 series or even less If it's a major upgrade for these guys then good for them and they definitely waited for the right card to wait on it was well worth the wait If it's even a guy that upgrades from the next best card than good for them too If that's what they enjoy doing and it's honestly the people that keep these cards pumping out with the Newest tech to improve it I held my 1080 and then upgraded to the 3080ti These guys will feel the same way we all felt when the next card comes out better and the same price as what they bought I just wonder what new tech the 5k or 6k will have to outpace this 4090 with its performance boost
I don't see how these people have the time or energy to do this shit Let alone have the extra money throw at overpriced cards
I built my first PC here and also my first tire blow out on the freeway and pulled into this parking lot too Fond times
And here i am trying to save up for a 2060
1 in every 2 is a scalper
They only have 10 lol It would be sad and funny if true
Never seen such hype for the release of the new space heaters
Holy hell
4090 is 10k in my country thats what a high end PC would have costed so im just gonna sit back and laugh in gtx 680
wow clowns still on ebay buying them for up to 4k
Can I get a cheap 3090TI that wasn't used in a mining rig
Take my kidney
Without Big A whats even the point
ITT over a thousand people flipping out over a photo of count them a whole 18 people who were going to buy anything Nvidia put out no matter what Wait for the sales figures before you declare the gaming industry doomed at the hands of consumers my god face with rolling eyes
You'd think with this entire thread being about making fun of the inevitable finally got it postsad nauseum they'd have the foresight to maybe idk not post it Then again people still posted the same shit at the worse points of the pandemic lol
The gpu is not expensive im just way too poor for it
Are ya winning son
RTX 4090 What's that And all that line for wha Free stuff
wow and that micro center is usually dead i ve never seen it like that
Here in the Netherlands its sold for 2500 and all out of stock
Hi I have never been apart of this subreddit it just randomly got recommended to me I one hundred percent thought this was an NXIVM subreddit and had to look up nvidia to make sure it wasn t haha
May the scalping begin thanks to nvidia this is possible even without high demand I rather get a new kitchen to bake me a 4090 for that price
This is what I was thinking don t forget they will have it buckled too
It ain't much but it's mine
Time to delete reddit app and block website on dns lvl for a week so I don't get in depression
and people bitching about not getting the card
You forget about the hundreds of Look at my new PC with an 4090 in it about the hit the sub PC reddits Thinking they have made the best decision of there lives until next generation comes along
Can we just preemptively ban this shit It s low effort nonsense I don t give a shit about what the box looks like or that you re upgrading
And tomorrow people asking how they can avoid tripping their home circuit breakers
Thankfully you can filter those flairs with RES
Can I print my order confirmation at bestbuy put it on a car seat post it here for karma then make a follow up post in 2 days when they cancel my order for even MORE karma
Next gen they'll be on a trailer
Or tied down on the roof it's too big to fit in the car
Just got a 4090 and pairing it with a 12900k Is this enough for 1080p I play on a 24 inch monitor
Thanks for reminding me to unsub from all PC subreddits for at least a year
I saved all the wooden nickels from my lemonade stand for 3 years to buy my dying brother this video card story posts coming to a subreddit near you
Car on GPU seat
Wow a box wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
on the back of pickup trucks I don t think it ll fit on a car seat
They cost about the same as children these days
Buckle up buckeroo D
NVIDIA's AI already informed Jensen that the card will sell well with that price
It turns out redditors are out of touch with reality once again Imagine actually thinking this card wasn t gonna sell like hot cakes
Probably scalpers thinking they'll make a profit
Meanwhile me YES get those 4090 tigers You don t need a 3080 or 3090 That s for loser like me
That s literally a handful of hardcore nerds and or scalpers
Jenseng won again
looks like they got at least 24 people to buy one
It's also the only microcenter in a large urban area One of the most populated in the country in fact Get that type of line at a store in central Missouri and then we're talking
Ive said it before and ill say it again the 4090 isnt a bad deal The rebranded 4060 and 4070 cards will be shit value tho
These cards always sell out at launch it s the sustained sales that matter
Who d have thunk that a new generation of cards with immense performance gains would sell well grinning face with sweat
those same mfers are right there they say that to make it seem nobody is buying it so they can get it easier
Dont worry They are gonna have like 5 of them max if ots anything like last time
I didnt see many people complain about the 4090 though The 4080 is the real issue here
California is not representative of the rest of the planet
Nvidia knows that people who can't afford their card will shit on it And people who wants the 4090 do the same as Nvidia they ignore this people
Exactly This is exactly what they where hoping to see Come on people Corpos go us by the curlys
It's Orange County in Tustin I techy people
It'll sell out at launch for the diehards I'm curious if they'll sit on the shelves after restocks
Yeah my first thought seeing this picture was oh great here are the jackasses who are teaching Nvidia that what they re doing is okay So don t crow too hard about it or be too proud of yourselves these people are the problem and this was always going to happen
Bold of you to assume Nvidia gives a shit about social media posts and comments x200B The business moves have been closely calculated probably months ago They expected this even if the 4090 was 50 of what it is today The simple fact that the 4090 is this powerful is simply going to assure them more people will join team green And to be honest why wouldn't you If you got this kind of budget going with AMD is a literal shot in the foot I doubt AMD has a proper response for this The 6900XT and 6950XT were called the Nvidia killers but all I read about was driver issues and stuttering in a lot of games even with an overclocked CPU Nah fuck that
To be fair anyone that is completely in on buying a 4090 is probably here in line After the initial rush I doubt we will see much after that The vast majority of people aren't looking to spend 1600 on a GPU
I don t think anyone was too surprised with the 4090 msrp It was the 4080 and masked 4070 that was surprising
It could be 2600 and this picture would look exactly the same That doesn t mean it s going to sell well
Considering I got one the are not there I felt like I was not fighting bots may be they exist also but it still felt like I am competing against people but not that high I was able to get to checkout multiple times unsuccessful and eventually got in
Dude people still line up for iphone too It's a fetish I think Regardless of course people were going to buy it
I mean yall can over pay ill wait a couple more years when the price is somewhat reasonable my 3070 does just fine
Welp this just confirms that I won't be able to afford to buy any recent gen GPU in my lifetime I guess there's always dumb people that will but shit at any price
Modern Warfare 2 boycott moment
Bro I paid 1900 for my 3090 direct from Evga Never found one much cheaper People are easily going to buy these Those people are dreaming if they think it's going to have a hard time selling
And when you see the prices in Europe that are between 2000 2500 minimum We are just back at prices from crypto
Before taxes as far as I know
I think that s all of them
Guy at the front has been here since yesterday
I thought putting my name on a list with a down payment was excessive Not even having to wait in line
To be fair I waisted 4 hours of my life waiting in line for Star Wars Phantom Menace At least they are getting a good product
Also a former micro center employee Not Tustin though early launches were always terrible
That's why you allow preorders
If it helps I for one enjoy seeing lines of clowns waiting to be scammed
Fry's closing down did you guys dirty There are two Microcenter stores in SoCal You'd need two more just to equal one Fry's there were 5 At one time in SoCal
I bought a laptop from microcenter online and tried to exchange in a microcenter physical store The employee was suspicious of me I heard him tell another employee to keep an eye on me after he asked me to wait at the online pickup counter Do you know if there is some kind of scam going on with people returning online purchases that would cause the employee to be suspicious
except this time theres plenty of good gpus on the market for everyone
Nah I can get atm asus 6900 xt for 700 after Nov 3rd it will go even lower These are just folks that are conditioned to get newest on day one but not nearly enough of them to replace miners or even gamers willing to spend three times more than for 6900xt 3080 Sit tight and watch prices crumble next year once nvidia moves piles of 3000 rotting in warehouses and amd launches their competition Considering amd 1bn target miss you can bet they will push like crazy to sell new gpus Without mining no way to have ludicrously high gpu prices
People in Orange County have a lot more disposable income and 1600 isn't that much to a lot of people around here
St Paul population 300k LA population 4 mil Add another 1 mil for San Diego which is easy driving distance
Also if they were heard rain last night before I went to bed Live about 5 mins from that Microcenter Sucks if anyone did lol
Don't worry that's coming next gen This was their plan to test the waters If day 1 this card had poor sales and nobody lined up for it then maybe there was chance of Nvidia realizing oh shit maybe that was a tad bit too high But clearly its going to sell out day 1 and now Nvidia's going to look at this and go awesome we're definitely raising prices again
Well Europeans pays close to that
Funny cause most of the cards are over 2400cad the strix is 2700 that's about 3000 after taxes guess I'm sticking with my 3080ti I got for 700cad for a couple generations
That's how much some are going for on ebay already some are selling
The AIB prices might be closer to that then you think
The 4090 was never the problem though It s the 4080 that s stupidly expensive for the performance It s barely if any boost over the 3090 The 4090 is actually a beast Granted I wouldn t spend that much money on a GPU unless it was a workhorse But it ain t my money
I wish they would judt because it would at least be funny before it get depressing Just have the first month be somethjng outrageous 3200 for the first 4 weeks See how many still show up lol
It s just California things doubt it s happening to this extent anywhere else
Why is it depressing Inflation has gone up by 25 since 2016 The worshiped 1080 Ti launched at 700 With inflation that would now be 900 The 4090 also has 24 GB of VRAM and the die prices have gotten more expensive to buy and produce from TSMC
Yea I am going to be very sad when we realize that EVGA gutted themselves for nothing
Where are they getting the money from Are they all sitting on that much income to spend 1600 on a gpu
im thinking about building my own computer this time instead of a prebuilt but idk if its a good idea to be doing that on a computer thats gonna be 3000 4000 in parts
California salaries are always higher to keep up with cost of living but rtx 4090 prices do not go up based on cost of living
U gonna say no on that one
This was also in California where the average person can't even afford to live there There's no lines at any tech stores where I'm at In Pennsylvania
Well that's depressing but not unexpected Guess it depends on who you ask I do vaguely recall some talk about how much excess 4xxx stock there would be sitting around after launch but maybe I dreamed that up
Or heavily in debt lol
This is in Cali Most people living there make a lot more than the rest of us Realistically I can afford 1600 for a gpu but I'm not fucking stupid I got bills to pay plus imo no gpu is worth as much as a used car
Don't assume people who buy all this expensive stuff are rich They could just be bad with money with lots of debt
You're not poor and these people don't in ANY WAY represent a market segment
They are just buying the card to keep their homeless car or tent heated in the winter
Recessions only affect poor people
You think people who can afford this card are affected by recession Only the poors are affected by recesion and inflation
2020 was apparently a recession I legitimately had no idea until someone pointed this out to me that it was an actual recession and people spent more than ever on frivolous crap
Sadly a lot of people will be buying it that really can't afford it with the direction the economy is headed
Some people save their money for things important to them I haven't seen the costs of living change for me one bit And for real life 1600 truly isn't much A mirrorless camera can cost 2000 6000 Travel Thousands
iPhone costs 1000 and many people upgrade every 2 years A graphics card handles everything you throw at them and can last you 5 6 years I don't get it why people keep complaining about the value of RTX 4090 In my opinion they should switch to a renting model and charge their customers 50 a month to shut them up
Lol if 1600 breaks your bank you have more things ro worry than recession
To be fair the card delivers That doesn't mean the price isn't absolute bonkers Edit typo
Had a good laugh
Well the price is a bit ridiculous man
Yes
The true greenlight was a while ago with 2080ti
I And they always get sold out in their first week or two of release
And if it was cheaper it gives 10X the scalpers the green light
Premium products have premium prices I'm not sure why it's such a problem There are more affordable products too
But this basically just gives Nvidia the green light Nvidia makes money and the people who buy it get a great card What makes you think either of those parties aren't happy with the arrangement aren't happy to give the green light or get some green light as it were
It demolishes 4K up to 120 fps This is really not a card for gamers The fact that it's using DP 1 4 is proof of that The biggest gains are in 3d rendering and creative work for which budgets are much higher and people will happily drop thousands to improve their workflow
I think most people here are true nerds but those folks in the tent might be professionals that are waiting for someone else or scalping We are all talking and having a great time
So I don't see a problem with making a 1600 GPU for people who want that I see the problem as not making a new GPU for anyone with less than 900 A lot of people holding out for price drops on Ampere and I don't really know if that's going to work out The sub 700 market isn't being updated anytime soon
I think Redditors are hilarious While I think the pricing is wild this thread is full of people acting like 1600 is a lot of money and only rich people could possibly afford this Some truly funny stuff It s a little over 100 a month for a year If that s a lot you re either a child or living in poverty and shouldn t be looking at a 1600 gpu in the first place Wait til these people buy own a home and have something like their furnace go out in the middle of winter and have to bend over for the plumber when he walks in All it shows is how many entitled children frequent this sub A 4090 is beyond a luxury item for a vast majority of people
Definitely not as bad as 3080 s launch tho I remember driving by there the day before right after their closing time and it was already packed with the line pouring onto the other side of the parking lot
What You don't want to spend almost 2k on a GPU COME ON MY GUY
Word lol
These people are the reason why Nvidia thinks everyone is loaded with cash are loaded with cash
I don't understand this statement Are you saying these people should boycott the card in solidarity to lower the price Or are you saying that Nvidia a 300 billion dollar company doesn't know it's market to the extent that they will be misled by day 1 sales into excessive MSRP Because it doesn't make sense to say people can't afford it clearly there are many who can and are willing to
Yep and they ll resell their 4090 for 800 and continue the cycle of paying 50 per month for a high end gpu wish I was that rich oh wait
Their GPUs aren't their main business anymore Nvidia appears to be an AI company first nowadays
And why Microsoft is betting big on Cloud Gaming
They re already on eBay starting at over 2k I hope all these retards lose so much money out of these These scumbags along with miners are the reason Nvidia thinks everyone is loaded with cash
I think people next to me are Haven t talked to anyone
There won't be scalping this generation I've talked to three retailers who said the supply is more than enough to meet their expected demand Anyone trying to scalp one of these is going to end up returning it in the 14 day window
open offerup tomorrow lmao
Talked to one individual and he is trying to sell his spot for like 500 700
Or Virgins
These people legitimately believe they are putting in a good day's work just for camping outside for hours Self employment my ass
ND ppl will line up In droves to buy at scalped price too We are the only ones to blame the consumer
They have pre orders up on eBay for 5 700 over msrp
All of us in line were really enjoying the negative comments To me its totally worth it I didn t take work off just had to pull a all nighter Didn t have to pay a scalper premium or wait extra time I have it now when I get to enjoy it About double the performance of 3090 for 100 more
Not having DisplayPort 2 0 makes this card already obsolete for 4K gaming
I ve been talking to most folks in the picture about gaming all night But I have a theory the guy in front of line is a scalper I tried to ask him what he was upgrading from or what game is he excited to experience and he seemed confused But he s been here for 36 hours lol But he said he doesn t even have a PC and it s his first
The funny thing is there won t be availability issues on this line after the first couple months I hope the scalpers eat a huge loss on this one
I doubt it but I hope so because they deserve what's coming if they think it's going to be anywhere near as profitable as it was even just 6 months ago Have fun being forced to dump them at a loss by the end of the year
I remember a Youtube video where a guy went an interviewed people camping in front of a Microcenter for the 30 series A bunch of people were there to scalp with wads of cash in hand I hope they get caught holding the bag this time
We aren't scalpers sorry man i got a 3080ti and 3090ti too lol i can just afford the cards
People that obsess over scalpers think they're everywhere They're bots they're in line they're hiding under your bed Recession inflation chip shortages global but people blame all their problems on them Can't get what I want Scalpers Price too high Scalpers Sore leg Scalpers Macarthy was more relaxed about communists than you people and your scalpers Give it a rest
gotta appreciate the hustle
Some folks in here legitimately upgrading graphics on their flagship 6 core Extreme computer from 7 years ago with their 4K60hz monitors
4K 120hz OLED TV is a great reason to own a 4090
They are opening 6AM
Surely the line is only for 4090 buyers right
They're all there for one thing it should clear up pretty fast
Or enough poor idiots
They said they have plenty but who knows Most here are genuine freaks like me
word on the intergalactic news is there's shortages every where and bestbuy site crashed after 5 min of being live
The ceo has flat out stated that they would artificially limit the number of 40 series so they could inflate prices and sell 30 series
The fact that Nvidia tried to cancel their order with TSMC and TSMC told them no should tell you all you need to know about the supply of this generation The card might be sold out for a month or two but I don't expect it to last years like it did with the 3 series cards
Look at Gamer Nexus tests especially the part with RT on I can tell you a lot of people will stick with 1440p and finally get decent fps and be very happy with it
I use 1440p but use dldsr so it s 1920p Makes a huge difference
Most here at front are FPS whores Can t wait I am not satisfied with performance on a 3090 on halo infinite elden ring and read dead 2 That will be fixed shortly
We have nothing here on the scale of Microcenter and Fry's RIP in the Bay Area Central Computer is the largest supplier available
RTX 4090 3k What a STEAL Scalper on Ebay
Even though the guy at the front has been here since yesterday I actually have a theory that he s a scalper
Why sorry Smaller size means better
What are stocks looking like
I got mine at Mayfield Heights as well Same model I d rather have the FE model 1799 is kind of steep for an OC model IMO Best Buy never showed them available though
Some got more money than sense im one of those Hope my 4090 beats the shit outta my 4K 120HZ C1 OLED P
They didn't There are still cards in Newegg as I type this Wasn't anywhere close to the 3000 series selling out in seconds Yes they will sell out today like any electronic these days but not the same
Me and the adjacent people are true nerds Been talking about games and what we are going to play since 4PM It s been a good time
I literally just did the same ASUS TUF OC 4090 from Micro Center Just left the store lol Not many people there though I am here about 2 hours after opening though
That's different than my microcenter for sure They had 700 people lined up and the guy said you won't be able to reliably get your hands on this card for months
Most of those people are scalpers Go check eBay and see what they re selling them for
You can still get it soon from scalper at over 3 2k USD
Link
Lots here with their wife and girlfriends
They are going out and meeting people I specifically enjoy product launches just to meet people
Did someone appoint you to be the arbiter of acceptable hobbies or is this something you just started doing
I can t focus on anything in my life until I get my hands on this I care about this more than my friends family SO
I met some people standing a microcenter in the dark thanks for the advice
Just fyi some people legitimately use this hardware to make a living and something like 30 reduced time in rendering directly translates to more productivity for their profession Same reason lots of people spent ridiculous amounts on Quadros and Titans Not everyone just uses it for pure entertainment like you might
People who have deep pockets with most of their pleasure comes from getting the fastest and latest tech in the market
It's not really a whim people save And it's also literally double the performance from a 3080 to a 4090
There s a huge difference between being able to afford something and being willing to pay for it Could I take 1600 out of my bank account right now and go buy a 4090 Yes Am I going to Fuck no lmao that s more than I spent on my entire PC
Pretty sure crypto stuff should have been the headline there There shouldn't be a supply issue because the average person shouldn't be buying this damn thing at launch Very impressive card but come on guys please don't encourage Nvidia after everything unless you actually need it The industry is facing a bit of a rough ride for the next year or so which means we're likely going to see some great deals in the process That said rising inflation is not going to be fun for anyone and many of you working long hours to pay for this thing may seriously wish you'd saved the money That's at least half a tank of gas in CA right now
Msrp Maybe cheaper by New Years It ll be hot for like a month then spazz out
This is just sad fools waiting in a capitalist line I mean you're not wrong but look at this picture half these people have never touched a gaming pc they're part of a scalper community out here doing what they'd call hustling
Pretty soon you ll be paying over 1k for a low end basic mid tier card You think the prices are high now Just wait Nvidia is getting greedier and greedier by the day They think everyone is rich and can easily afford a 1600 card
Seriously its socal most of us have plenty of disposable income for a 2k card
I don t think they truly care just pointing out how ridiculous it is to camp in line for an overpriced GPU in a recession no less
I worry that people lining up to spend this kind of cash on new GPUs will eventually price a lot of people out of the hobby and push them back to gaming on consoles so I can understand why some people are bothered
Personally I'm not laughing at buyers but I do laugh at people who value their own time so little that they sit this one out for hours one has been here since yesterday I love my job and I could bill a client 75 of the price of the 4090 for 8 hours of work If I were to just work and have fun in doing so about 16 hours for the time some of these people sat there on a chair I could buy one and still have money to spare That is what I can't grasp but I guess others don't value their own spare time as precious
Thank you sir may I have another
But how will it s value look compared to the 4080 and lower priced models that release later on If the 4080 offers anywhere near this level of generational improvement you re going to find much better value at that price Edit nvm I forgot they re charging 1200 for the real 4080
Be me Never work Play video games all day Buy top of the line every generation Open more credit cards File for bankruptcy Get freebees from the government Say I am sorry Rinse Repeat s Congrats on finishing your fellowship and getting an awesome PC I am sure you deserve it
Micro center doesn t sell FE
I ve been talking to people and we are all just really excited to play games with high frame rates We are too OCD to play on our 3090s knowing we are missing out Pretty sad LOL
People were buying 3080 for 2000 3090 for 3000 when this card was being developed This is an expensive card but also gives two or more generations of improvement in a single generation You're right in that they gave us exactly what we wanted 1 year ago
Not counting interest
It won't happen though
Could have saved another 200 and not got the oc version
I still play kotor from 2003 on my 3090 face with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughing
seethe more
You re the one that s an absolute moron
What insane power consumption It s the same as the 3090ti it s actually a lot more efficient therm nightmares From the reviews today I haven t seen one go above 70 C at like 90 utilization and that s with the smol FE cooler Its also the biggest leap in GPU generations ever with above 50 up to like 70 performance gains
At least 50 percent gains Elden ring lame at only 80FPS infinite 60FPS I m a whore for frames A special kind of stupid
Believe me its just these nerds and even we re embarrassed for them
This was an everyday occurrence at Microcenter for almost a year during the GPU crisis
Nothing matters to me more than FPS I d sell my mother right now for a 5090
Americans are overworked underpaid and generally have a much lower quality of life than the other first world countries Let them have their fun
What's MSRP in Germany 1600 21 tax or whatever vat you have there I'd not expect the number to be below 2k euros
I get your point but there's a significant of people that put everything on credit cards and just pay the statement balance every month
Bestbuy did nothing to stop bots
I love other 3090 owners telling me I don t need a 4090 I m getting almost double the performance for 100 more two years later not a bad value
High end VR headsets but yea otherwise there is really nothing pushing graphical limits sure Cyberpunk is demanding but thats because they went overboard with the raytracing otherwise nothing stands out in that game besides the environments MSFS2020 Forza Horizon 5 RDR2 are stunning and demanding but are all already playable max settings with acceptable framerates on 3000 cards We are still in the cross gen phase too so games are still being gimped to run on ancient PS4s One Xs
Hush my child
I want to play my games above 50 or 60 minimum fps where my 3090 already fails in dozens of games So I indeed need the 4090 for my gaming usecase mate
Do people still do what Be a pretentious asshole like you or spend money on a hobby
That turned out to not be true
You know people work different schedules right You made that comment at 3 45 did you take off work or school Lol
You say that but they are already showing out of stock
They're out of stock everywhere man
Not true at all they sold out everywhere in about 3 minutes
Is that Gabe Newell s son
Almost like you are reading replies from different people with differing views
Yes we are retired
Don't be broke don't get married have kids It's very simple to have disposable income
Thankfully Micro Center places a daily purchase limit on your driver's license
There s like 100 more people here behind the people on the right
Point them out so I can harass them
250 all sold out
Yeah but the margins are probably only a few hundred
They were actually in stock for awhile I got a asus Tuf on newegg Bestbuy never had a FE in stock from what I seen Idk if it sold out that fast or what happened
I just left the MC in Mayfield Heights OH and there were a couple people in front of me asking about the 4090s
You can come over when you get cold
I m sitting here with my jaw to the floor benchmarking all my favorite games Love reading all the insults they just put a big smile on my face
They'd need to be since the seatbelt sensor will keep beeping at them if they don't
For the price of
And make sure that their GF looks disappointed in the backseat
Walked into a microcenter for a thumb drive and ended up with this
My first build what do you think Followed by a picture of a 7950k 4090 and full rainbow vomit with custom water
Spends entire savings on a gpu that doesn't even fit in their case or car
Lol yea when my 3080 5900x complete build cost was less then a 4090 alone face with tears of joy
Bruh y'all sound salty as hell x200B What is so wrong about people enjoying their new hardware Didn't you feel accomplished when you bought that 1080 Ti or that 12700K Genuinely asking And also just because you didn't post something online it doesn't mean people shouldn't
These people be camping outside all night Meanwhile Jensen is sleeping soundly wearing his comfy leather jacket
This may look like a joke but it's true
Or any price Jensen might fire AI for low ball predictions
You mean Jensen already informed Nvidia's AI
first batch always sells availability week after launch will show us true demand on this card
I think you might new to this whole GPU thing because pretty much every single major GPU launch sells out no matter what it is been that way for ages We usually know the true demand a week or two later
There are many people to whom money is no issue They spend it on things like hypercars designer clothes gold watches fancy shoes 5 start restaurant dining In this case the fastest gpu possible
The 0 5 that 3090 has on steam after 2 years shows what a small amount such expensive cards move This will sell a few right now at launch but you'd have to be completely delusional to think this will sell like hot cakes Especially when in the rest of the world this is priced between 2000 and close to 3000 euros Mimimum wages in eastern europe are 250 to 350 euros net in a month x200B This generation is simply not feasible for the majority of the planet Im 100 certain nvidia will have its lowest quarters just like they did with Turing when they had the worst profits in history
I get the impression that broke ass teenagers represent a dis propionate number of reddit users Hence your answer
2080ti and 3090 instantly sold out at a way worse perf per dollar 4090 is gonna cruise
I mean I can absolutely easily afford a 4090 or any 4 series for that matter but it's a garbage value so I'm not going to buy one Sure the first couple weeks will be sold out but the demand drop off will be staggering
Redditors hate anything other people like particularly when it's expensive Also anyone with more money than them is a millionaire Republican ghoul
If 3060's and 3070's sold close to 1K for 2 years a 4090 will do just fine
It's more the copium speaking when cards are out of their price range I was getting some negs when I posted the 3080 I got at
People think that because they make shit money everyone does
Wait what I ve been reading this sub often enough and I don t think ive seen any redditors saying it wont be hard to get when it launched If you seen a couple it probably wasn t many lets be honest
Those 20 people in the photo would be there even if the card was 5000 and there's a lot more of those but they are dwarfed by the amount of people that would be there if the card was 800
The bots were out in force hyping this
Maybe a lot of them are there to meat and greet Austin Evans
Redditors are out of touch because we think Reddit is the whole world During the 2000 series times if you looked at Reddit alone you would think they were a huge success but the reality is that nVidia had to decrease prices The 4000 series is just another nonsense but here on Reddit there are users with more money than sense that can always make up an excuse However Reddit and especially this sub is far from representing the reality
This one will But I am not so sure about 4080s
There s like 27 fucking people in the photo calm down champ I ve seen bigger crowds than that for toilet paper s
Plot Twist Everyone in line thinking the same thing I hope I can sell this for a good profit on Ebay for waiting out here all night long After all I'm doing all the hard work here in getting these cards in hand
People said it would sell out here because there are a lot of doors with too much money
This is an overstatement I doubt their sales performance is going to be that good
I have a really good feeling that these are not going to sell well at all and we are going to see price cuts very soon after
Oh yeah I knew it would Sure maybe 20 of gamers are pissed about the price The ones who line up for new gear don t give a fuck Typically I might get a 4090 but not day 1 I don t think I want to plan a full upgrade and find an atx 3 PSU too
I literally haven't seen anyone saying 's even ironically the best value card compared to last gen It's a complete beast and only 100 more than 3090 MSRP was something enthusiasts are willing to pay It's the 4080s that are going to be a huge flop at these prices Still in this 4 digit sticker shock range but having pathetic performance compared to the 4090 All these enthusiasts willing to spend 4 digits will just go for the 4090 instead And the rest of us just can't afford or don't want to drop a grand after tax aib margin no FEs on a GPU Especially one that should be named a 4070 and cost
People really don't understand the spending power of others
These are mostly dumb scalpers Quote me
I think it will sell but I also know it s a poorly engineered card and overpriced
All those people in line are probably redditors lol I bet half of em were part of the group complaining
You don t need a 3080 or 3090 That s for loser like me Meanwhile I'm just gutter trash with my 3070 lmao s
21 people Doesn't seem like a lot
ive been to both the tustin microcenter and also the one in st louis
Which is completely the opposite of most GPU card generations All these new Nvidia GPUs are too expensive but usually the xx60 xx70 and xx80 cards have relatively good performance per dollar and the xx90 and Titan class cards have poor performance per dollar It's the opposite this time The RTX 4090 will sell out instantly
They just increased price and performance linearly If you need more performence sure you might want it But after 2 years it's definitely not a good deal if price perf stays the same or even gets worse
You have to look at it like this too the 4090 starts at 2100 euro in Europe the rog STRIX is 2700 euro In Australia 4090 starts at 3000 For Americans the 1600 price tag was never that bad
It's a worse deal than the 3080 or 3070 were Sounds like a pretty bad deal to me
It's baffling how much these people are willing to spend to have that performance What's the point You can play any game you like on 30 series and for much less money
The issue is moving the value proposition to the enthusiast 1500 end
I'm both amazed and terrified about equal parts
How do these people have so much free time and disposable income
Daaaang I have to work until 4 30am and was going to head down there from LA The guy I talked to on the phone today said they anticipate having enough to meet demand but looking at this photo IDK
I genuinely feel sad for people like this Being such a slave to physical items must be a difficult life
I would so go with that option if that were available I'm a Canuck and I'm bracing for half a year or so wait time
In tears 11 10 It got worse still lol
There are two Microcenter stores in SoCal No there isn't There's 1 in the whole west coast
RIP Fry s
X Doubt
Yeah unless Nvidia just keeps them to slowly trickle out to inflate the price
Or they just want the best GPU and it's in budget Not everyone who has the money and wants the best GPU is conditioned to get the newest on day one I have a 1080ti I want to upgrade and the 4090 is in budget It's hilarious seeing people cope by calling me conditioned or stupid
You have to include the whole population of the LA basin which are the counties of LA Orange and San Bernandino since that s the only MC store in all of SoCal So think of 10 million people
Within a 30 min drive of the microcenter there are 3 million people I acknowledge there is a different population amount but just wanted to add some info
The whole LA metro area has something like 18 million people
They can sell out day one and still slump overall sales Day 1 is not always a good indicator
It's 100 more than the 3090 launch People need to stop acting like this was some huge shock
Their plan is to not sell physical cards except to Enterprise and Enthusiasts They want to lease you processing power via a subscription for gaming and workloads The prices will continue to creep for the highest end and when they finally have their hyperscalers data centers built out adequately among the other infrastructure they'll begin moving away from physical cards for normal consumers
You're typing this like the 4090 is an incremental upgrade over what the 3090 Ti is currently x200B Remember how AMD matched prices Do you seriously think AMD wouldn't do it again if the 7000 series could magically perform similarly
Fuck me you got a steal on that thing Love it tender and love it true for a long time
I went to AMD this last gen but EVGA was the only AIB I ever trusted on the Nvidia side Going to be painful if AMD's driver woes end up sending me back over the fence Guess the FE models aren't too bad Everything else either too big ugly or both Nevermind build quality and customer service
I mean it s a hobby and as far as things go it s still a cheaper hobby For example I m into cars a decent set of coilovers is 2000 and that s just one component of the suspension my project rx7 has a budget set aside of 15m just to get suspension chassis work and paint over the next 4 or so years that doesn t even get me an engine and turbo etc Or a set of good tyres for my daily driver could be 1000 for some rubber that ll last a year before being thrown away
From the last time I looked 60 of people there make over 75k year I found this out when California announced their stimulus for people making 75k year
If you're choosing between bills and this GPU then you can't really afford it Yeah a GPU isn't worth 1600 to most people but that doesn't mean the people who can afford it and want it are stupid
If they re selling used cars 1600 I don t want it Those things are probably junk if they re selling for that cheap
Rich people don't wait in lines
It affects rich people too except for them it s merely an inconvenience
Do you really think obly rich people are buying this Tons of people live way over budget and buy useless expensive shit just to feel good
Stimulus checks and expanded unemployment was definitely not a recession What you're seeing now and near future will be though So 2020 definitely fed into it
Recession is not something that come and disappear in a blink You will see soon enough what a recession actually is There is a huge difference between a technical recession which is the one you refer to and the recession even your local bus driver will refer to
This might be harsh but I imagine a large proportion of people there are spending above their means For many who can truly afford a 4090 they can't afford to sit outside of a store for two days A 1600 item isn't worth the opportunity cost of two days when you view your time as an hourly rate of your income The reality is a lot of people struggle with personal finance and don't understand the distinction between savings and disposable income when they look at their take home pay can vs should It's also not unlikely that a subset of people there don't actually even have that and the GPU is going straight into their credit card debt I don't believe that applies to everyone there of course but it will for some to many
I haven't seen the costs of living change for me one bit You mean to say your lifestyle has not changed neither has mine but I still see price increases and money that is missing compared to last year
Yes and most people don't buy 2k cameras or spend thousands traveling
I haven't seen the costs of living change for me one bit B
85 of the world lives on 800 wages a month come back to reality please
The card could come with a free handjob for all I care At what point does anyone put their foot down and tell NVIDIA to shove it There's so many controversies and bs from them that I can't even keep count
iPhone comes out every year btw Not even 2 years D
You're right I know some really simplistic folks that would get by just fine with a basic spec phone from 5 years ago upgrade to the latest and greatest iphone I'd probably still be using my Galaxy S8 but found a brand new galaxy S20FE for 100 canadian and couldn't say no to that
Iphone cut its production back this year There are limits it seems
Yes but there's no saving those people Plus the iPhone is basically a fashion accessory they can show off all day in their bubble For some reason people think it's weird walking around with a graphics card but make no mistake all the chicks know what having a 4 5 slot card
Every phone manufacturer releases a new flagship every year This isn t unique to apple
I get people wanna make money but they could at least try not to be scumbags about it
THIS The 30 series cards are still plenty fast They didn't magically slow down Plus for the average joe they are literally good enough for most use cases
I hate to break it to you but people aren't lining up at 11PM in tents to improve their workflow lol
Is there any kind of limit on the card purchase per customer Scalping is disgusting and I'd like to see hear more about its prevention
My 3070 is running just fine Don't need to upgrade for awhile
Yeah but isn't it normal to launch the top 2 or 3 cards ahead of the mid tier cards There's no reason to think they won't release sub 900 40 series cards right
Whatever you think the problem is people not only buying but camping outside stores to get overpriced hardware onlu encourages overpricing Imagine if you were an employee at Nvidia looking at this photo I guarantee you your first thought would be maybe we should've gone for 1800
Knock knock
I don't think anyone is saying 1600 is loterry prize winner money What we're saying is 2 generations ago you could get the same tier card for a lot less money Each generation the prices increase for the same tier product And plz don't tell me it's faster Of course it is Its newer it's not costing more to make it It's faster because technology allows it to be faster I guess some people will only understand when they can no longer afford to buy the same tier card they easily bought 4 years ago
Agreed You get that sense around here that Nvidia is personally insulting people by catering to a different market if they even know what market means
1 Australian Dollar equals 0 63 United States Dollar 1 United States Dollar equals 1 60 Australian Dollar
Wow that s insane
Just because your currency has the word dollars in it doesn t mean it s worth the same as USD Dumb comment
We don t have insane high taxes already added to our products like you guys do Do some research before you open your mouth on taxes in the U S
That's 1895 19 USD Retail here is 1600 USD Add sales tax and you get to 1750 depending on the state Not that big of a difference You have universal healthcare I'd pay that 150 dollar difference for a video card if I didn't have to pay 50 000 for surgery Oh 't want facts you wanted sympathy My bad Oh you poor thing mean old company charging you so much moneys for video game hardware
That represents a price premium of around 300 US from US prices You're definitely paying more but not as much as it seems
That's actually exactly how it works If the product doesn't sell near projected sales goals prices will have to fall It doesn't matter how much a company is worth and it's not just about Nvidia They have AIBs and retailers relying on sales and investors to answer to If they don't start selling well until they're significantly dropped in price obviously that will affect decisions next launch While you'd be right in saying what happens in the next few days means fuck all in the grand scheme of things the next couple of months will absolutely affect decisions moving forward The rise in MSRP from the 20 30 series is testing the waters to see what people will really accept while dumping shelves of old stock It's a win win Either people still buy at this huge margin because they're used to the mining boom or they simply cut prices towards the end of the quarter as needed Then the 4080 Ti releases next year around the initial 4080 16 GB price which was the plan all along
95 sure at least half or more of the people in the photo are dumb scalpers
Hahaha they re already on eBay for 2000 already
I think people next to me are Haven t talked to anyone We are all talking and having a great time huh
Stay safe out there and thank you for your service
good point but I still feel like you're underestimating the power of human greed
Yeah but probably half the people in the line 'think' they are going to scalp it There are already 30 posts on eBay
What a scumbag
5 over MSRP is fair tbh
yes of course they do that just doesn't mean shit they've had cards sitting in a warehouse for months and the amount of people who want a card this generation comparably is not as much as the last for several reasons
I can make a listing for 50 000 over MSRP So what
Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate amIRight Life is short if you can afford it buy the best toys IMO
yeah most of them are probably trying to not give away the fact that they are a scalper after all they would probably get some people pissed off in line if they said they were Scalpers tend to keep on the down low and stay out of sight
Dude totally a scalper 100
This guy scalps
Well they gonna get caught holding the bag Ethereum went proof of stake No point in buying these anymore en masse
It's not a hustle to force yourself as a middleman between two parties
Plot twist they are all waiting for Intel 750 770 cards
LOL Good luck man Chill and smoke a bowl I'm sure you'll nab one
I'm confused sorry Couldn't they be cancelling their order to create scarcity
4080 will be able do to that for way cheaper than the 4090 is way too overkill for 1440p
Still overkill and stupid to get a 4090 for that 4K with 1 75X DLDSR would make sense tho But its your money so do it if you want
Fucking hell what settings are you using for a 3090 to struggle
Elden Ring It's max 60 and I get that consistently at 4k ultra on my 3080
Halo infinite isnt worth playing let alone buying a new GPU
Go with God king
Im sorry that they have to put up with customers I m not talking about graphics card size lol
I m in a podunk little city compared to the other cities that have micro centers so that s the context when I say we re doing just fine on stock levels of the 4090 Back stock is currently sitting on little movable racks called bakers racks and all of the 4090 baker racks are currently parked in front of the Apple back stock and they re in my god damn way Lol back stock is great atm is my point lol
Agreed unfortunately they only had 3 of the TUF 4090s They made us spend money lol I'm good with ASUS because I wanted those 2 x HDMI I can't afford 3 DP displays I have 3 HDMI TVs I plan to use it with and lose 1 of the TVs GSYNC DP to HDMI adapter for now
I don t think people that buying 4090 are idiots I am buying it too but people that sleep upfront of a store is a different story
Yeah they opened early today here I think 9am Usually it's 10am I got there around 9 40am Microcenter is the best and I'm lucky to have had them near me for as long as they've been around here in NY
man i hate scalpers
MSI too They are now going in and out of stock but it was quite awhile before sold out x200B isPreview 1 isSlp 1 asins B0BG94PS2F B0BG959RCF B0BG94BM2G isPreview 1 isSlp 1 asins B0BG94PS2F B0BG959RCF B0BG94BM2G x200B x200B Keep checking back I'm waiting for Aorus Waterforce 360mm cards since EVGA is out of the game
They brought both their wife and girlfriend
Don t let people shame you for doing what you like If you have the disposable income availability to do this more power to you Even more so when you get to meet and network with other enthusiasts like yourself Hope you snag a card
The 21 million American millionaires agree
Having the money in your bank account isn t the same as being able to afford something There s plenty of people who make the money to pay for a 4090 in a few hours I ll pay for mine with a night s work and use it for the next 5 years
Lol i use my pc to make money and game so im getting it man shruggingman shrugging
Bro you can buy a 3060TI for like 450 right now There are decent options for normal gamers
There are plenty of cheaper options from Nvidia on the market This is a top of the line GPU It s going to be expensive and this isn t marketed toward the average gamer
Thats like a week and a half of rent here
Ain t a recession for everybody lol
The opportunity cost of time is different for people If you are a scalper making 18 hr on your day job then flipping a card for 400 profit for sitting around overnight may be worth it Especially if you are underemployed or not getting enough hours at work Bringing along your spouse multiplies your returns If you make 250 hr then camping obliviously doesn t make sense Hell the inconvenience of online buying may not be worth it if you have to spend several hours spamming F5 vs just buying something off ebay You can have capitalist class individuals making 50 100k mo passively who decide to camp out just for the camaraderie playing some epic DND tailgating experience There are lots of reasons people will camp out so I don t judge But I do agree these may be scalpers doesn t look like many people are out there having fun from the looks of this one picture except the front of the line someone needs to bring a 30 pack and get the party started
Camping out might be some form of social activity for some of them to hang out sith fellow gamers but definitely i would rather spend the hours working to buy one instead of waiting in line
If the 4080 16GB obviously offers same level of generational improvement it's still going to be terrible value because it's literally 50 more expensive than the 3080 The reason why the 4090 looks like great value is because it offers 40 60 better performance at the same price point as the 3090 was launched at
Yes they had random allotments of 30 series from time to time I know people all over that got them there No one knows whether or not they will have them or if Best Buy is an exclusive partner
holy shit really They did in the past I think they stopped though and now only Worst Buy carries them
That's honestly sad Maybe go to therapy
True lol
Just because it s more efficient than a 3090Ti doesn t mean it s not insane power consumption lmao 450 w is ridiculous whether more efficient gen vs gen or not Also smol FE cooler In what reality does one exist or how much crack must one smoke to call that cooler smol
I remember not too long ago Linus put out a video about these clowncakes physically fighting each other for GPUs in Micro Center parking lots
I've been a PC gamer since just after the NES days I'm no stranger to spending silly money on GPUs especially since they're more expensive here in Europe But camping outside a store Come on fam neutral face I dunno I find this image deeply depressing In fact it's quite worthy of r aboringdystopia
Tax here is 19 MSRP is 1949
Did they give up their queue system this time or has that already been bypassed long ago I remember they did the Best Buy geek squad power enhanced platinum edition membership that burned a lot of people that gate go away too
I'm just trying to explain how I didn't need a 3090 when I thought I did We're in some kind of gaming dark age of cheap remasters and lack of
I'm running ALL games at 90 FPS on ultra settings with a 3090 Methinks it's not your GPU that's the issue The one exception being Star C
I check reddit when I'm sitting at the shitter That's where I read your comment also I almost flushed it away with the rest
Wow such an original take
Interesting Did they have any
Underweighted comment
They look disappointed in bed all the time don't need to see it the backseat also thought that may have been the initialization spot of the disappointed face at one point in time
Am I the only one left on the planet that actually seeks out parts with no RGB
When I believe that their foolish spending is going to lead to an increasing spiral of GPU prices that is not healthy in the long run for a hobby that I enjoy You damn right I'm salty
In all honesty no I never have It's money out of my pocket for a purchase I wanted I don't see a reason to flaunt it online because who the fuck cares I mean I'm sure you'll say you care because that's the default response to the questions though Not sure why disliking something salty but people overuse that word like crazy
Felt pretty good buying my 3080 FE brand new for 700 direct from nvidia Everyone else is getting robbed in my eyes
Nah not salty far from it the opposite 4090 is a great card terrible price but a good card means when I get a 5000 series card it should be even better As for your question did I feel accomplished when I brought my new hardware yes and no When I was younger yes thought it was the best thing since sliced bread However when you get older you realise there is far more better things in life than GPUs and hardware the wow factor goes
Why would I feel accomplished buying a PC component I was proud of myself when I was 15 and bought an Xbox 360 but that's because I worked part time at Burger King lol Investing 1600 into a GPU is just stupid unless you need it for work imo In which case most companies will set you up Its a great card but just insanely overpriced
and also
Making money while sleeping
Now that you mentioned he is always wearing black leather jacket whenever I see him
That leather jacket is cool tho
That's what I am most interested in seeing as well Every major GPU launch sells out Also a good amount are probably scalpers I imagine
Still will sell because people like me are waiting to be able to walk in walk right out I dont do the line bs
Or availability after launch will show us how many cards are actually produced For all we know RTX 3XXX was more or less paper launch due to silicon shortage They may have a lot more stock now We don't know
Bingo No one said people won't buy it Lots of people said VERY FEW people would There are always cu with more money than sense
I literally went to Micro Center yesterday and bought a 3070 for 560 and they still had 16 of the same card I think a lot of people will realize the GPU shortage is a thing of the past and more people will be buying 20 and 30 series
I honestly think the 4090 will sell well even after launch The 4080 16GB is too expensive at 1200 and the performance gap appears large enough that if you've got the budget there's really no reason not to go for the 4090
This assumes we haven't been nuked a week from now of course
Very common misconception that only rich people will be buying this card You don't have to be rich to be an enthusiast You just have to plan I've been saving for this card since I put my 2080ti into my case four years ago Nearly anyone can save 1700 over the course of four years and it becomes even easier if you sell your old card
0 5 of all steam users That's incredibly high for any Halo card ever The Titan and the Titan X and the Titan XP to my knowledge just barely even made it onto the steam hardware survey at the 0 16 breakpoint at the bottom of the chart 0 5 is actually selling like hot cakes for the halo tier card
0 5 is huge because as you say for lots of the world's population a 3090 is a few months salary so amongst the people who actually have a chance of affording one it seems to be quite popular If Steam has 120 million active users that means 600 000 people have 3090s
Idk where did you get those Numbers but in eastern Europe people is not that poor
I wouldn't be so sure People don't upgrade every year In fact the recent shortage and crypto boom put a lot of people off from upgrading their computer parts particularly GPU for a long time which gave them more of an excuse to extend that wait Many of those folks are itching to upgrade especially with such a hefty performance boost this generation If Nvidia's going to have any kind of financial gap it'll be because the 4080 16 GB and 4080 12 GB are a month behind in release And they won't because aside from all the 4090s which won't have a problem selling Nvidia can still offload tons of 3000 series cards to distributors Nvidia like Wizards of the Coast can get away with selling their products for a premium just like the recent MTG 1000 30th anniversary reveal and people will pay for it
The 3090 was seriously just a bad card in terms of performance to dollar when compared to the 3080 The 3090 would have basically been a rounding error in my finances at the time and I didn t even consider a 3090 NVIDIA spent the money to push the tech and made a product out of it to recoup their costs This time around the 4090 is a great upgrade and it s performance to dollar value is also objectively better than the 4080
Like others have said 0 5 for such expensive products is insane You're the one delusional here And no one on minimum wage buys this stuff or any gpus for that matter regardless where they live But even in eastern europe there are people who can pretty easily afford this I e a software engineer makes 2 4k euros a month The fact is that despite the whining in this sub anything above a xx60 models have never been feasible for the majority of the planet And lol you're completely delusional about nvidias profits too Anyone who cant afford a 40 series will just buy the 30 one instead which is exactly nvidias plan
0 5 out of 120 million users is A LOT tho
This generation is simply not feasible for the majority of the planet so are super cars but they still make and sell them its such a stupid analogy
The 0 5 that 3090 has on steam after 2 years shows what a small amount such expensive cards move That s very high for a non gaming top end card Probably the highest it s ever been compared to similar past gen models like the Titan But using gaming metrics to project sales of a non gaming card doesn t make a whole lot sense Mimimum wages in eastern europe are 250 to 350 euros net in a month Pretty sure that s not the target market of a 4090
I could afford it but over 2300 just isn't rational for a GPU I will keep my 3080 and put that 2300 towards some nice extras on my next car If I was still on 10xx or 20xx I'd be prepared to dish out 900 1300 The problem isn't so much the 4090 pricing but probably the 4080 and fake 4080 being overpriced in comparison Maybe by the time the 50xx comes out I may or may not require an upgrade Considering 1440p and the games I play 3080 is yet to meet it's downfall Also don't want my GPU to make my room uncomfortably hot
I don't think you understand how economics work if Nvidia can sell a 1600 dollar card that has a 60 profit margin that gives them a profit of 960 per card If they only sold 250 3050s at a 60 profit margin they are only making 150 per card They have to sell over 7 cards just to equal one 4090 Sure not everyone is going to buy a 4090 but if you can sell a couple thousand of those 4090s in a batch or two then you have stupid profit to work with Selling 3 000 4090s will give them almost 3 million dollars to work with Even if we quadruple those sales and sell 12 000 3050s for 150 profit we only made 180k You see the difference now You have to 7X your sales of your lower cards just to keep the profits of the higher end cards It becomes exponentially harder to supply that many cards as well to meet the profits of the new 4090 Granted Nvidia will sell a lot more of the lower end cards but they simply only have to put in minimal work to make huge gains off their XX80 XX90 tier cards
Yeah the gaming target audience for this card are 25 40 yr olds that moved to 4k gaming in the past 5 yrs Not a product marketed at teens
I mean I used to work in a factory and 1500 dollars was 3 weeks of pay So dismissing people that can't buy what is essentially a luxury item as broke teenagers really lacks perspective
Hot take but I predict the 4090 to be the best price to performance card this generation The 4070 and 4080 will be rather weak in comparison but still command enthusiast pricing forcing you to think well if I just spend a few hundred dollars more I get way more performance I strongly believe this is strategic from Nvidia
Mate you will be surprised at how many sensible people out there thinking the same Many could afford it if they want to but sensible people would not simply throw away their hard earned money at garbage valued product just to stroke their egos for couple of more fps which is negligible after 144fps
Also anyone with more money than them is a millionaire Republican ghoul I lol'd because it's true People with low disposable income greatly exaggerate the impact of the cost of things like this on people with high disposable income or wealth This card is literally aimed at the bleeding edge PC gaming crowd and they are people with the money to afford this stuff without any issue and who buy the best card of every generation 1650 every 2 years on a new GPU is objectively chump change to many people and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that A high end GPU is no worse value than many other luxuries in life and if you game a lot then it's probably good value
I dunno I can afford a 4090 easily but I'm voting with my wallet because Nvidia are turning in to a garbage company Waiting to see what the AMD offering is like
I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fun cars the last few years People here acting like a 4090 will bankrupt me face with tears of joyface with tears of joy The wage slave mentality is programmed in early on in school Most people can't seen to break out of it
Nice generalisation you have there
Ferrari dealerships would be swarmed if they sold their cars for 10000 what's your point Nice things have value People are willing to pay for that
Must be comforting living your life thinking only bots ever disagree with you Kind of like religion for zoomers
I've also been to the one in Tustin They have a good microcontroller section mid way to the back on the left side behind the drones
Yeah Im glad i ONLY Play Dota2 my 2080 is more than enough for that game running 120fps in 4k So i dont worry about buying expensive shit
Not in 4k with ray tracing on high settings which is the point of this card
Well I mean it's at least an actual item they are there for Which will have a somewhat limited supply We've had a few lately in my city which have left me mind boggled A bunch of people camped out for days to get the chance to be first to meet some tik tok only fans chick Same thing at a Billie Eilish concert they had tickets and all yet people camped for 3 days to just get a slightly better spot at the gig
Because they don t You would be surprised how much people simply can t help it but to buy this card even if they realistically can t It has been the same for so much stuff for years now
I mean I have vacation days up the wazoo same for all of my friends and we all have pretty standard post college jobs It wouldn't be hard for me to take a day for this if I really wanted to for that matter I could probably just work remote off a hotspot though Zooms might be a bit dicey
Y 2000 extra bucks to throw around and a few days off work I feel so bad for them Poor
Yes I too feel awful for the person who can drop 2k on something he's passionate about and take two days off in the middle of the week to do it Wait a
I'm betting at least half the people there are looking to turn a profit by reselling the cards They see it as putting in day's work for self employment waiting in line for hours overnight
Memory Express let's you get your name on a list for whichever AIB you want
Oh damn haha It's Micro Computer Center in LA Wow How far we've fallen
Damn I totally missed that it died Of course it was kind of junk for the last decade or so they needed to modernize like micro center but damn some good memories
Ppl should really consider 3090 700
Yes and buying on day one after waiting 5 years makes perfect sense If Nvidia launched it 10 days later world would crumble Sorry but no logic whatsoever in waiting in line for GPU after waiting for years to upgrade when it will be steadily available and most probably see nice deals to tackle and launch by the end of the year
launch day is never an indicator There's always gonna be fanboys well off ppl that buy a product no matter what
I would say day one is largely an unimportant metric Sustained sales over a quarter would be more determinant of popularity
The 3090 also launched during peak crypto mining hype demand which isn t really much of a thing anymore I makes me wonder when it will stop Just a few generations ago we had the 1080 Ti launch at 699 Top of the line GPUs have gone from 700 to 1600 rather quickly
Let's not normalise the 3090s price It was ridiculous in 2020 and 1600 is ridiculous now
WTF 4090 is 300 more coins than the 3090 at launch where I am
The problem is that the 3080 was half the price and got you 90 percent of the performance The 4080 is barely and upgrade over the 3080 and costs way more The 40 competes with the 30 when every other gen replaced the one prior
Cost of entertainment per hour is cheaper than a movie ticket
Rich people pay someone else to wait in line
It's more of an opportunity for the rich to buy on the cheap from the struggling middle class
I was just thinking Look at all those dumb fucks lining up to finance a GPU
x200B It was most definitely a recorded recession lol
A 1600 item isn't worth the opportunity cost of two days when you view your time as an hourly rate of your income Y and in tech
That's just pointlessly making shit up about nothing Even if what you say is true it'd be no less true if these items cost like 400 Someone who cant handle their finances cant handle them either way
This is true but those was never remotely the target audience of this nvidia product
How does that change the statement lol Living paycheck to paycheck is a thing but also living above your means is definitely a thing
Had my 3080 for a little over 2 years now Still a stellar card running plenty of very nice games at 3440x1440 Even if someone offered me a 4090 at MSRP without this lining up BS I still wouldn't spend the money Anyone that doesn't want to fork out for a 4000 series just get a 3070ti or 3080 3080ti and enjoy it They're a great card
People in this thread are 100 acting like anyone buying this card is some sort of wealthy person Go through and read it
I agree with the general tone of your comment but I think you underestimate the number of people who will buy this card who can t buy this card You and I are the minority and realistically we don t constitute the market
Still cheaper than a lot of hobbies
Yes however there are way more people who don t have that much money to spend If NVidia were also selling decent budget cards I don t think anybody would be mad about ridiculous high end offerings The real problem is that NVidia is signaling that they want to make gaming as a whole into a hobby that s rich people only
Most people have families and so things outside of the pc They have bills to pay that is a higher priority than for you
Not to mention not everyone who buys one is a gamer For full time content creators the boost this can give on productivity over the next buncha years makes it a very logical purchase
a lot of people don t understand that the 3090 and 4090 are more for workstation use It s extremely easy and fast to make your money back within a month
I don t care That's the problem I really hope you don't get caught complaining about anything NVIDIA is doing because you are part of the problem I guess EVGA's message means nothing to you
Hahaha ok Enjoy your non existent health care I guess
Hahaha that guy thinks that a professional person is gonna have time to go out and wait for a gaming gpu Nvidia has the quadro series for them Maybe one out of those guys is actually buying it to game on and not scalping it
There s a group of friends next to me that came with their wives so they can buy multiple cards
Greed is powerful but people don't want to lose money
Lmao
I want one of those actually seems like a fun tinkerer's challenge But honestly the madness of the 4090 launch is going to keep me away tomorrow
I was agreeing with your assessment I think Nvidia tried to cancel the order to create scarcity but ultimately TSMC refused and said the order would be filled So I don't expect the 4 series to be as scarce as the 3 series was Now that doesn't prevent Nvidia from sitting on warehouses full of chips but that would eat into their profits as well
It s funny that you re calling it stupid yet you re the lameness who doesn t have the card I get to play Elden ring butter smooth 120FPS now not 80 Read dead redemption 2 everything maxed Starfield will be great Dead space remake Get rekd
I am convinced people find problems that don't exist I am pretty sure the human eye can only see up to a certain fps point I think 60 is the most extreme a human can realistically see I am certain people run benchmarks or the counters and see the numbers and have the need to match or beat a number than what the actual visual quality is
What It's well known that AAA games like those listed make any pre 4090 card crumble at 4K
You can uncap it with a mod
Oh my bad
Oh ok Yeah Tustin is my Mc Hard to tell if worth it to drive there now
Yea well some people are impatient as hell again im one of them I was thinking of heading down there around 4am but from the photo seems i wont stand a chance Online is gonna be my next front
It can also be looked at as a fun gathering of like minded individuals Some might call it a party
Mine is 40 minutes away from me in Mayfield Heights Ohio I haven t come here very often but it s convenient not having to wait for shipping and the employees don t seem too pushy with the service replacement plans
Damn I didn t realize the 4090 released today Did you go to Westchester or Long Island
Thanks fellow person I'd rather have SuprimX or Strix
No luck here on those
Yeah gonna need them both to help pay
Having 1600 in disposable income isn't exactly out of reach for many working adults myself included But in terms of making that kind of cash in a few hours that would put your salary at over a million a year which is nowhere close to reality for most people I know we all like to pretend we're millionaires on Reddit but come on now
You get paid 200 an hour You hiring
I use my PC for work too but none of my workloads require this kind of power and I'm happy with the level of performance my current GPU provides for the games I play on it My decision to not purchase a 4090 has nothing to do with me being able to afford it
450 for a low end card is honestly hilarious compared to what the x60 cards were in the past
You honestly think only the high ends are gonna expensive Nvidia wants to raise prices in EVERY THING Why do think EVGA left the market There won t be any other seller besides Nvidia and they will sell the cars at whatever they want
Exactly And people speaking as if it is fact like they have no money or that they skipped work Who is to say these people have lots of money and took time off It s a product launch people do the same for iPhones GTA or a new console This thread is shitting on people for enjoying their hobby and the whole thing comes across as sheer jealousy
Oh shit I forgot they re asking 1200 for the 16GB model yeah that s fucked
Yeah I will thanks to your comment
Yeah I guess that s fair But this thing is kinda revolutionary for 4K gaming I might get it in a few weeks
Lol I heard about that Hilarious
God damn that's brutal If you don't mind how much are you paying for natural gas with all the armageddon shenanigans going on
Yes they had several of the models in stock I picked up an ASUS TUF OC 4090
It's pretty
I don't look specifically for non rgb however I definitely prefer non rbg in the tower only rgb I want is a little on my mouse and some form of back lighting on the keyboard
Agreed As much as I want and can buy a 4090 I'm going to sit this one out in hopes that sales are considerably lower which will drive prices down Building a PC used to be cost effective and fun Now it's scary I don't offer to build friends and family PCs anymore because you're practically forced into the used market which can be a gamble and also overpriced as well
Blaming consumers for GPU prices and expecting them to boycott is very easy when you already have a card If they re spending foolishly buy their used 3XXX for cheap At some point it is what it is bro I don t preorder games either but I m not salty that hardcore fans do Less salt is good for you let people spend their money Also buying parts is not your hobby maybe gaming or building PC s is and you don t need cheap 4090 for that
I spent that amount in euros on a 3080 12G a few days ago x200B But the prices in my country are wild This card cost like 1800 1900 euros half a year ago
Yeah but that's a bit of a philosophical take I'm 28 years old and while I'm not as crazy excited about hardware as I was when I was 15 I'm still quite happy about it and thinking about it x200B Yesterday I sold my old 144Hz monitor to a guy who was 65 years old His wife drove him to my location and after a few details were spoken I said Your nephew will love his new toy The guy replied with I'm the one who is going to love this new toy And after chatting a bit more with him and his wife I found out he loves playing world of warcraft and racing games and he does it on the daily for multiple hours Imagine my surprise when I realized this old guy is a legitimate gamer and he's passionate enough about it to do upgrades like this
Or you can be able to afford a nice life and GPU You guys are salty as hell To some people 2k on a GPU is hardly anything
I mean hey you live life in your own way Not everyone does it So good for you in that regard x200B But let me remind you people there are people who spend money on this and they feel like their fashion life peaked and they are all smiles Do you still think spending 1600 on a GPU is stupid A GPU which you can enjoy in many ways and that can help you use some complex software as well
I'd sleep great as well
thats how you get rich
I don t think you understand Jensen is the leather jacket the guy attached to it is just some random dude
Let's hope them scalpers are left holding the bag
there is limited number of customers which can afford that expense so no unless there is very limited supply of cards but I doubt its less than ampere ampere sales were boosted by miners mining is gone so my best guess is high availability next week or two from release I just hope people wont fall for nvidia 40780 scam and buy 12G version thinking its full power 4080
Source This was debunked if I recall correctly It was more of the function of mining demand plus people awash with cash while staying at home Supply was at least as much as usual
Upgrading to this wouldnt imply that you also have to upgrade cpu not to be bottlenecked Which means new motherboard pherhaps new ram for DDR5 Also new PSU pherhaps Damn at this point might as well just get a new case for how cheap it is compared to the rest This is a whole new system
Biased by the crypto market Many would have bought it to mine and kept it because it's good at gaming
It's the lowest number of every Ampere card while being on the market the longest And the number hasnt changed in the 6 months since steam's shows the older data at least That means the card that was the longest on the market sold the least and nobody bought more in at least half a year What im saying is that cards this expensive simply dont sell Regardless of pics like this where a handful of people are waiting for this card in the wealthiest country in the world where an average salary allows you to buy 2 cards
Your points are sound But then we also look at Turing where the 2080TI was the only card with a sensible raster uplift And it was still the worst generation for nvidia sales wise Current evidence just points to the fact that a 1600 dollar gpu is just too expensive
Some of you guys are really hard on copium for some reason You are offered the lowest and most stagnating number of all Ampere cards and the conclusion some of you draw is how amazing it is Yes trully amazing that there's zero increase in users for at least 6 months No 0 5 of any number is not insane nor amazing nor big It's 0 5 And the number hasn't increased in at least half a year It's the most ignored and poorly sold sku out of the entire lineup
Except gpus are not supercars We already have precedent with Turing They were the most expensive consumer gpus and they were the worst selling cards in nvidia's history
Silently cuts into line at micro centre
I mean I guess I also have the money but I also find it dumb to spend that amount on a GPU Like I have some of the best PC comps that you can buy easily at least but all of that still comes out to around half of that gpu's starting price
This is great but I also have a vested interest in hating on you because people like you make it harder for me to afford to get decent price to performance as Nvidia realizes they can get away with fucking us in the mid range As a xx60 class buyer these past few years have not been fun
Commenter above you is probably thinking he's exaggerating with that statement but there are a lot of rich folks in the US alone Over 21 million people are millionaires at least on paper and that million is the minimum And he's probably correct that most of them vote Republican
Hmm am i out of touch No it must be the people that cant afford all this expensive shit
Not that easy if you get stopped in customs you get fucked Anything above 800 ish has to be declared and with 25 vat that makes it a bad deal
Not enough support for raytracing in games to justify spending that much You can play in 4K on a 1080 if you want 20 and 30 series can easily do it with the support of DLSS
Imho the gig thing is sheer lunacy I get the limited item bit I just truly cannot imagine lining up through the night what about washroom safety weather etc Three days
I mean it s practically the same thing They probably looked at those ppl camping out the same way At this point there shouldn t be any judging if people are campion for an actual item
When home doesn't feel like home and you have nothing better in life to do these actions begin to make sense We all have to care about something to keep ourselves busy be it work hobbies or getting a better spot to have a sense of achievement
Yeah you gotta wonder how many even have the CPU and or display to really take advantage of it Or case dimensions lol
No doubt Cushy well paying remote jobs with a lot of flexibility are out there
Do not underestimate the power of borrowed money
These people are maxing out cards when they shouldn't don't kid yourself
Oh wow I had no idea wish I knew sooner
I ll miss their wall of motherboards weird cafe and hentai
If that deal existed I imagine people would
I don't think people who are looking to buy the 4090 want to buy a used gpu that's half as fast and lacks dlss3
But I don't want last gen parts A 3090 can't even handle 4K 120Hz on ultra with ray tracing Hell the 4090 barely can And I don't have the patience to wait for the 4090ti So I don't really have any other choice
I didn't say the world would crumble I said it's in my budget and I want it Why should I wait because you told me to person facepalming
I even hate this mentality 1080 Ti were never 700 at launch Founders was 800 All OEM variants were 800 And that was before tax 1080 Ti was 1000 in most places over the world at launch
Is this not supoosed to be the equivalent to previous Titan cards Which were always 1000 I think it's just a big deal because Nvidia is marketing the 4090 way more than any others as we normally recieve the 80 cards first and now we got the 90 first This card isn't made for the average consumer nor were the titan cards The renaming of the titan cards and the increase of marketing was really smart by Nvidia to get these cards to be more mainstream
September 2020 absolutely was not peak mining hype demand lol not even close
It's been my experience they don't do that either They already have 3090Tis and are happy with that They don't see the problem waiting a week till they can just walk into the store and walk out with one on their own time
yeah this thread is showing how privileged PC gaming is now a days lots of money poor shaming here
Main model is every September Like clockwork Which one are you thinking of SE
Huh it s literally every year to the month
Not really they always come out in September Unless you re going to classify the S models as an incomplete model which is incorrect
I love when pc bros think they know everything about technology and show their intellectual mediocrity in front of the world
its exactly 1y
Have a 3090TI at that resolution There s literally 1 game that isn t over 120fps at absolutely maxed out settings Cyberpunk And I find the game boring The 30 series is still insane Never mind the fact that the vast majority of people are still rocking a 150 27 1080p monitor You basically get a 3060TI for that and you ll be 150 fps in every single game
Considering price hr of entertainment it still blows most things out of the water I mean how many people bitching about this card s price spend 40 every weekend on alcohol etc That s 2 000 a year Not saying spending time with friends and having a good time isn t great but everyone has their cost benefit analysis opportunity cost etc and some may find a 1 600 gpu purchase worth it
As an engine building enthusiast I agree
Like what A lot of people like to say Magic but I played Magic hardcore and it's a lot cheaper than this
How is it rich people only If they weren t going to release a 50 60 70 series maybe you could argue that but they will be launching affordable gpus soon This is like saying Jeep is only for rich people because they released a 100 000 Grand Wagoneer
Man you're dumb Learn some basic economics Currency strength and cost of living varies greatly between countries Like if you went to the US would you really expect to get 3000 USD for 3000 AUD
When you ve made it abundantly clear to everyone that you re too dumb to even understand exchange ratios deflecting may indeed be your only next step
I bet the wives are impressed
Isn t micro center limit 1 per household tho So the wife thing wouldn t work altho I m sure it s pretty easy to surpass don t know haven t tried
Well just nabbed a OC Gigabyte on Newegg So guess you were right
3090ti can already do that for twice as less i'm not jelous of your overkill GPU because i don't have a 4K120hz display and a 12900K 5800x to properly use it
It s ok you can just admit you ve never seen a 144hz or above monitor
That is a myth The USAF RAF and CAF have all verified that the human eye can perceive images in the timeframe of 1 220th of a second meaning that the effective limit for the human eye is 220fps for each individual frame to be seen and 240 for the absolute highest your brain can work to perceive the imagery TL DR Human eye limit is 240fps
You can but people generally don't it can mess things up and there's the potential to get banned from multiplayer features
The best thing about the Microcenters me is the employees are all computer nerds They are all into this stuff and most of them know what they're talking about Sometimes I just hangout and talk tech shit with them They are cool at the Microcenters here in NY especially Westbury NY
Westbury NY Long Island
Wouldn't mind a strix hybrid
Yea they were in stock for quite some time before finally going OOS though I really don't expect there to be a real stock shortage Manufactured shortage by trying to balance the overstock of 3000 possibly though
I don t make that money every day of the week and don t make over a million a year but it s going to take me a single evening to pay for my 4090
Don t make a million a year but can easily make 1600 in a day at my job Easy decision for something that will provide me with 2 years of entertainment
250 an hour on weekends
And your a waste of dna yet ya momma let you live Shame
calling 3060ti low end though is sort of ridiculous it can play 99 of games out right now at max settings 1080 or 1440p at 120fps or better Even 1080ti's still crush most games at 1080p that are out including lots of new games Only an extremely small of high end games fully utilize even something like a 3080 and that's if you want to have all sorts of extra features like raytracing
Since the 1st of October it is 11 cent per kilowatt hour gas That's roughly 60 more than before Gas prices vary a lot by region and supplier in Germany and I know some people who got a 300 increase But just last week the government put together an aid package that will limit the gas price to 12 cent per kilowatt hour for the consumer To keep the gas suppliers alive the government will then cover their losses For me personally it's not the biggest of deals i make decent money and don't pay a lot of rent but for families who recently bought houses and calculated very tightly or people who lived paycheck to paycheck even before the war it's very rough right now
Nice They're still showing in stock in ohio
3090 for 869 and 3090ti for 999 new on Amazon right now for prime day so don't even need to buy used
It is what it is is what got us to this point where 2000 video cards are considered normal And if you refuse to see the consequences of that on PC gaming well I can't help you
lol my mum plays world of warcraft and shes 70 years old and she has a friend they play together for the last 15 years and hes older As for myself im 49 and yes im a gamer but ive chilled out alot since i was younger I dont get super hyped for new tech anymore or game as much Age does that for me Its getting harder to enjoy gaming and stuff like that as ive been playing games since i was about 7 years old Thats a long time
Most people are shit with money and are in crushing debt The average American barely has any savings based on recent studies But hey its not my money Id consider getting one if I was single and without kids
Everyone has there own opinions even if they don't no shit or is just plain wrong
Hey man that's true Everyone values things differently Id never tell someone what to buy in real life Who am I to judge anyways I had a 2080 Ti for 999 back in 2018 before I got married lol Though I did sell it for 1200 during the pandemic My 6800XT was 550 but very nearly bought an RTX 3090 for 999 instead
Hopefully Anthony at LTT speculated these may have been sitting in storage for a while being they only have display port 1 4 which makes no sense for the 4090 being it could use the extra display bandwidth
Reports show Nvidia has tons of silicon for the 40 series It s a matter of time before these cards go to people s hands
It was mainly miners buying gpus for double market price because price didn't matter Scalpers will probably try again but I doubt they'll sell anywhere close like last time
Who the hell would buy from scalpers now It ain't miners They're done If you really want one of these that bad wait a week for the day 1 artificially limited supplies to get restocked and pay the egular price
Dont buy em scalped and they have to sell at a loss but also we tell people dont preorder shit and they go and do both anyways
What I am curious is what the official 4070 will end up being in the end will it be worth it or will it be too
How do you know the supply Everything is more or less anecdotal No one has the source on numbers for overall GPUs except nvidia
I mean I'm upgrading from a 970 and a i5 6600k to the 4090 if I can actually get one and a 7800x 13700k You're forgetting that a lot of people didnt want to buy 30 series due to paying at least in europe 100 euros over MSRP for 2 year old cards
For sure This card is far from a standalone card The CPU is cheap just get a 5800x3D at 350 or however much it costs nowadays The monitor is worse you need a 4K 144 Hz like the Gigabyte M32U Ultrawide is okay too but I find it fishy
Exactly this one of my mates has only ever bought midrange AMD cards but bought a 3090 cos he could make money when he wasn't gaming and paid it off
it might make a difference that 3090 vs 3080 was a small bump at a high price while every indication so far makes it seem like 4090 vs 4080 is going to be a large bump with a smaller price premium
Good value for money card if your using it to increase work productivity with gaming on the side but that was about the only scenario
I think Turing suffered from the greatness of the previous generation along with the poor rasterization uplift and rtx being irrelevant for the most part Basically it was more a one off oddball than the norm
No 0 5 of any number is not insane nor amazing nor big Haha so if I told you 0 5 of the world's population bought a 3090 you'd think that number is not insane nor big Just take a second to look at the nonsense you're spewing
Why would sales of the 3090 increase a few months before the 4090 launch Consumers aren t idiots Mostly they are comparing previous titan level cards to the 3090 and the 3090 had 5x the number of steam users compared to previous titan level cards They aren t comparing the nominal numbers but the change
I don't understand your points the card isn't aimed at Mimimum wage workers eastern europe on 250 to 350 euros net in a month If the card doesn't sell and people think they're too highly priced then I don't see why you care so 't what does it have to do with anything Just buy a cheaper card if this one is too expensive for you or buy an AMD or Intel card Or an older used card Many people can afford the top tier premium card and that's fine if they're willing to pay Nvidia for it
I also have the money but I also find it dumb to spend that amount on a GPU That is your own subjective opinion that no one other than you give a rats crap about To people who want the best performance especially those who games at 4k or are VR gamers then it is worth every cent to them Reviews confirm the performanace of this part is insane and significantly better value in relative price performance terms than the 3090 was
Like I have some of the best PC comps that you can buy easily at least but all of that still comes out to around half of that gpu's starting price I don't even get what you're trying to say here You think an 800 PC is some of the best PC comps that you can buy Bottom line is a 4090 is pretty good value for someone upper middle class who games a lot and wants to do it at 4K high FPS
It literally IS the people who cant afford this shit People here are just entitled and pretending that they have some god given right to have access to incredibly luxury and entirely unnecessary products on their mid low salaries
Anything imported in Norway over 800 has to be declared So If they catch you You have to pay and you get fined a hefty sum for trying to import something illegally However I can always buy it from my cousin Or maybe it's a gift
I have a 3080 and am trying to buy a 4090 this morning I assure you the 3080 is mediocre at 4k with ray tracing Need to turn down tons of settings use DLSS performance and still get fps dips Constant fiddling with settings Whether the price is worth it to you doesn t really affect me It s a small amount of money for me Worth it is always up to the individual
Tech bros who were nerds in the 90s growing up are now google engineers with multiple thousands of take home disposable income dollars per month to spend on toys
Having camped out for GPUs before and as someone who always arrives at concerts 3 5 hours early to stand in line I buy GA General Admission tickets to concerts which is standing pit near the stage and first arrivals in line get closest standing spots barring VIP GA being sold the key here is that those of us that do it often don't dislike the experience Assuming you're the type that can hold bathroom needs for a long time it can actually be fun to pack some snacks a chair and whatever the correct clothing for comfort is depending on the season and just sit and watch netflix or read a book and of course chat with other line waiters Because you know what That line is often populated with people who are as interested in the thing you're waiting for as you are I just waited for like 4 5 hours to enter with General Admission pit tickets at a The Killers concert this past friday and I spent the entire wait chatting with fellow fans It was great And while VIP spots were sold that let people in 30 minutes early I still ended up in essentially 2nd row from the front and I actually got to the rail barricade after some people left before the band came back for the 3 encore songs Altogether it was one of the best show experiences of my life If the only way to get that was to camp out over night I'd do it Plus for lines lasting longer than several hours all the people who get there crazy early usually make friends and keep track of the line and let people take quick bathroom trips to nearby restaurants and such At the concert line we had a guy literally numbering people on the hand with sharpie marker lol When I had to leave the line to get my ticket physically printed due to a scanner error at the venue the line let me back in at my spot near the front right before gates opened Basically the long waits are an experience often shared with people you can relate to and so while it can be a little rough depending on weather it can actually be a lot of fun Oh and at the GPU camp out at a bestbuy there was an entire Smash Bros tourney on a flat screen in the back of a pickup truck If that doesn't show the kind of vibe lines can have I don't know what does
I camped out for concert tickets back in the 90s as a teen 24 hours One of the best nights of my life The concert was ok too
Exactly It s the same thing
If you happen to be in Alberta you can have my spot I signed up for a TUF 4090 on the first day and then decided I'm going to keep the 3080 for a
729 for a 3090 ti was on buildapcsales recently OOS now but yah it is possible
3090s are like 750 900 on eBay right now
In Hong Kong a rather expensive place they are even selling under this
Lol dlss3 they are literally adding fake frames
I just wanted to say that the 4090 is the same price as my rent and i live in hong kong which has the most expensive housing in the world Thats really saying something
Of course not but you noticed topic is folks waiting in line for GPU We can't discuss it because it triggered you for some reason
The only thing they have in common is being over 1000
They didn t rename the Titan cards Titans are professional class GPUs with ECC memory and licensing for professional applications The 3090 and 4090 lack either of these They are gaming GPUs
40 every weekend on alcohol This is the extreme low end of that hobby for anyone I know Mixed drinks between 15 20 seems to be the norm in most cities Pretty easy to blow through 100 200 in a night if you pick up a friend's tab or order any food Not to mention Uber
Cars bicycling watches shoes clothes guns and many more not coming to mind right now Hell a full day dyno tune costs almost as much as this gpu or more depending on the car tuner Pc gaming is a cheap hobby in the grand scheme of things
Motorcycles golf cars art should I keep going
Go troll somewhere else I ve seen your post and you love trolling people
They'll have a funny story to tell their boyfriends
Nice congrats
That is a myth The USAF RAF and CAF have all verified that the human eye can perceive images in the timeframe of 1 220th of a second meaning that the effective limit for the human eye is 220fps for each individual frame to be seen and 240 for the absolute highest your brain can work to perceive the imagery TL DR Human eye limit is 240fps Yeah I went from a 144hz monitor to a flagship G7 odyssey 240Hz and the difference was easily noticeable to me Can't understand how people say they can't see the difference after 60hz lol
It's not only about FPS For me I doubt there will be a difference in image between 120 144 or 240hZ but there is definitely a difference between running a game at 240fps and 100fps even on my 144hZ panel The game feels significantly more responsive because of the lower frametimes Is this 'feel' worth 1600 That's up to you
I might do some further deep diving into that later tonight I always got the impression from stuff I read on average it was much lower But back to my other point surely you would agree OP has got to be pedantic about some graph or stat chasing target unless they have some outlandish multiple 8k monitor setup or their system is that poorly configured and are running god knows how many applications when trying to game at such resolutions
Links to those I'm not doubting you I'm just curious
That s awesome man enjoy I should have paid more attention to the release
All the same i'd like to secure one and stop worrying over it Guess its time to spam refresh
That s great I m sure if you can make that much discretionary income in a single day you can purchase a 4090 without thinking much about it But it would take most of us just a little bit more work than that to make an extra 1600 so I tend to think more about value when I m spending that kind of cash on a luxury good
Legit curious In what field do you work in where you can make 1600 not even in a whole day of work but in a single evening
That would still put you somewhere within the top 5 in terms of income so yea I am sure you can afford it without having to think too hard about it lol I personally got more than 4 years out of my last GPU for a lot less money
That's 200 an hour if it's an 8 hour shift You selling drugs
Wtf do you do Thats insane
ahaha so you agree to being a fat incel face with tears of joy if i was you i would ve spent the money on escorts to take away my virginity lil bro
Damn well glad to hear it's not as bad as I'd been hearing but hopefully it doesn't get any worse going into winter Average gasoline price is getting rough there as well right I'd heard it's up there with the nonsense we're currently paying in California 7 00 g which I imagine would impact some families harder than the natural gas
Its getting harder to enjoy period with prices increasing every gen The money I make hasn't gone significantly up every generation and its getting harder to keep up which sucks the joy out of it
And a lot aren t even the top 10 is 30 million If you work in tech you are making 200k a year many engineers are making 500k at 30
There are basically no monitors I want to say actually none but there might be a few I don t know about that have DP 2 0 connections so there s not much incentive for them to put it on now They could add it as a revision or just straight up hold it for 5000 series
This Exactly this The 4090 drives games at more than 120 fps at 4K Using DisplayPort 1 4a makes no sense To display more than 120Hz at 4K on DP1 4a it has to use DSC which makes everything look bad They should quickly revise this and put DP2 0 on new cards to drive 120Hz 4K screen without DSC
Yet ebay is already full with them face with tears of joyrolling on the floor laughingface with tears of joy
Nvidia made record profits over the shortage Miners and scalpers using bots made it very difficult for the average consumer to buy them from retailers Demand was unprecedented
The other post aside Steam hardware survey was also showing relatively significant numbers dwarfing AMD too
Yeah I agree with you My point was just that for most people this upgrade is not just 1700 dollars or 2500 It involves many other components and not cheap ones
4090 vs 4080 is going to be a large bump with a smaller price premium Until a year from now when the 3000 stock is down to acceptable levels where Nvidia feels confident to remove the artificial hyperinflated prices on the 4080 and 4080 The 4080 prices were set so abysmally to be able to drive sales of other cards in Nvidia's lineup
Maybe relax for a second and say it out loud that you're arguing on reddit that 5 represents a big number Say it out loud maybe it will come to you
I was responding to a comment claiming this will sell like hot cakes by pointing out that it will most definitely not sell like hot cakes There's nothing more indepth Its a card thats simply too expensive for it to sell large quantities In any country you live in
I meant the cost of the components of the PC other than the GPU I should have said that tbh But like paying that much for a GPU seems ridiculous I play a bunch of flight sims and even then it seems excessive
This post wouldnt exist if the 90 series would just be an extreme outlier and all the other GPUs would have affordable prices But the 90 series pricing is indicative of the entire line up GPU prices are extremely high And sure none of us have to buy them and a lot of people in this thread wont be it because they cant afford it or they dislike the pricing policy in general But thats just customers voicing their opinion If nvidia raising prices on their GPUs is fine its just as fine for all of us to complain about it and discourage others from participating Thats literally just basic ways of expressing supply and demand
I guess you're right Nevertheless as a google engineer you can spend that money on better things I personally like playing with new tech but after a while the enthusiasm goes away and you end up with a huge power hungry graphics card Not to mention uber high power bills that are coming this winter
Oh I totally see your view I was merely sharing my take on the affairs I both understand and share your view that if personality fits the wait can be a fantastic experience Mine does not
Hah I did the same Slept rough with a mate outside a ticket seller to be first in line for tickets to a secret Sepultura gig No one else turned up until an hour before the shop opened so was largely a wasted endeavour but it was fun as hell just drinking talking laughing and buying teas for the real rough sleepers in the area
You camped for a ticket a thing which has a limited number of sales These people bought tickets 2 years ago
Reddit moment when you get 10 for stating facts lmao
Okay but that's neither the price the previous poster listed or a deal for a new card so doesn't really make sense any way you look at it I'm not saying people shouldn't do it but you can barely get a new 3080 for 700 so it's just a bit of a disingenuous post
Eww used cards gross
Lmao I can see you're struggling to cope with people buying the 4090 Don't worry I ordered mine this morning smiling face with sunglasses
I was calling out your presumptuous claim about how people were conditioned to buy the newest day one It's okay to recognize that people may just want the card but are not somehow conditioned to always buy the newest day one person facepalming
Actually it has ECC apparently
Yes they want to push the prosumers to the ex quadro now RTX A gpus to not only take 1000 out of there pocket but 5 grand
Yes I was being generous
True Especially because we only buy an expensive GPU every 2 years whereas some of those hobbies I'm guessing many people buy something new a lot more frequently
This is basically a Desert Eagle
And travel
Thank you sir
But back to my other point surely you would agree OP has got to be pedantic about some graph or stat chasing target N
I tried to get the FE online but I never saw the ad to cart on bestbuy So I decided to try Microcenter I walked in with no hope They said they had plenty Im upgrading from a 2080TI so its a nice upgrade
Music weekends and in law during the week
Music on weekends law during the week
Dont you have something better to do than to pretend like you know me lol been married for 5 years now but aye your free to think whatever you want at the end of the day i dont care about you or your existence face with tears of joy you mean nothing to me thanks for the laugh tho
That's actually pretty much what we pay for too Depending on the time of the day and where the gas station it's somewhere better 1 80 and 2 2 per liter Before the war it was like 1 4 litre or so Luckily I get to work by bus and grocery stores are nearby but if you drive a lot it adds up Especially with pretty much everything getting more expensive Well everything except 3000 series GPUs
True Have to save up and skip a few generations of hardware which saves you money in the long term Even if you do have the money its better skipping a few generations but some people dont think like that and think replacing a full PC every year is considered a good investment not really like
I'd bet there are going to be some in the market soon Sony already has a 4k 144hz monitor it's 1 4 though I think he also mentioned rdna 3 is supposed to have it could be wrong on that Pretty much guaranteed to be a thing before 5090 exists and this card easily pushes 4k hard enough to need it Edit I may have been thinking of pcie 5 on rdna 3 which he also pointed out could be a big deal because it allows the card to use less lanes and leave more for fast storage
DSC is visually lossless You don t know what you re talking about
Found the one who has never looked at DSC
There's definitely not a shortage of absolute fucking morons with more money than brains who are willing to waste a few extra hundred bucks on something they could easily get on their own by waiting a week
That's mostly an AMD problem AMD has several SKUs where they sold so few that they don't even show up on the Steam surveys And last I checked you only needed like 100k cards to show up on the list AMD didn't sell even that much of many models
True true I just hope they arent scalped out the ass Dont want to be paying 3000 euro for a GPU
It's a good point but I was due a generational system upgrade from my 8700k anyway The rest of the system cost me 1600 with a 5800x3d Aorus x570S pro ax motherboard EVGA 1200W supernova P3 etc
Yeah man 350 million people is such a small number thanks for clarifying that where would I be without you
of course it will sell like hot cakes Nvidia makes billions from gaming video cards you can do the math to work out how much project they need to shift to make BILLIONS
All depends on your definition of large quantities Will it sell more units than the 60 series Of course not Will it sell more units than the 3090 or 2080ti or 1080ti That s debatable and the question a lot of people are asking
I would wager that you are pulling that statement out of your rear Of course some may do that same as with any luxury purchasing market segment but a lot Highly doubtful considering this GPU will require also buying a new case and PSU for many people A couple of guys I spoke to today with 3090's said it would not fit in their case
Ahh fair enough Yeah the best gaming CPU is pretty cheap at 350 Monitor is a bit dicey You can get a good 4K 144 Hz monitor for 650 but mine cost 1000 And there are some for 2k if you wanna go balls to the wall There are 800 motherboards too but they're a huge waste of money A 200 board will perform just as well
Ehhhh If I game hard 20 hours a week every week even a heavily overclocked 4090 would only cost me 90 year in electricity Mostly a rounding error on a 2000 purchase
Does sleeping rough or rough sleeping just mean homeless or a vagrant
The fact that Jensen came out and said falling GPU prices are a thing of the past makes me want to give money to a second hand market instead Buying their new cards at MSRP only reinforces that message
750 900 was the easy find I m sure you can find a 700 if you look hard enough What s wrong with a used card It s it works just as well for 300 less I would 100 take it Used 3080s are about 500
Probably still dirty from all that
Yeah we can get electronics cheaper as we have no sales tax or import fees shipping is usually free or almost nothing
So it does I know that the 3090 Ti did as well but not the base 3090 It s weird I never heard anyone talking about it but I suppose most people buying the cards don t really need it The licensing issue is still a problem though
Don't forget you have to feed that Eagle each time you use it
Oh that is another good one This gpu cost 1 set of round trip tickets to a far location
Welcome to the block list troll Got no time for trolls with no life
I have several 4K oled tvs LG WOLED and Samsung qd oled Alienware beats both with 175hz and ultra wide Don t render 3440 by 1440 It s 4587 by 1920 More pixels than native 4K Do you even know what DLDSR is It s a big difference
You sound like my boss
That dope I'm gonna go cry in a corner
Yeah sounds pretty much identical to LA and we don't even have a war in our backyard Unless you count the people running things Outside the big cities I just filled up at the cheapest place around 6 40 1 7 so not quite as bad With a 20 tax I imagine people try to get friends family somewhere like the US to purchases items like this for them then just mail it or is it tough to get around
Doesn't the card FE also have HDMI 2 1 And if so doesn't that support 4k 144 without DSC
The values were OK even by comparing to older Nvidia cards I recall it took 6 months or so for the 3080 to overtake the 1080ti
Yes the entirety of earth's population has much to do with the subject at hand Not realising how braindead you are for the sake of some inane arguing online
I explicitly said I'm not saying people shouldn't do it because there's nothing wrong with a used card
Thanks for telling me your life story with your wife Feel better now Now get out ya bed and get ya ass to work face with tears of joy
That would technically be illegal unless it's a gift but I'm sure many people do it that way
No 0 5 of any number is not insane nor amazing nor big Those are your words
There is nothing wrong with some used cards
Then I have no idea what we re arguing about your original point was that a 3090 for 700 didn t exist which is literally not true
Once you factor everything in it's probably not enough savings to be worth all the trouble anyway
This is added to Megathread This post is actually a re post from Facebook The actual user with this issue is He has created a video for his issue The real owner's Facebook Post mibextid HsNCOg mibextid HsNCOg
Really thought it was just the adapters this is not promising Is Cablemod and others gonna show the same issue when enough are in the wild Damn man
The original post is here he says he didn t use adapter but with native ATX 3 0 PSU MSI MEG Ai1300P Confirmed that cable didn t bent hard connection is tight
Just read the original post Luckily the card and Power supply are from the same brand MSI and the same distributor Card owner got new card and new supply replace at the same time
UPDATE MSI has contacted the OP to take the new the new PSU and Card at Monday
pay 1800 to worry it will get burnt or not every single day that's just awful
I have a thermaltake ATX 3 0 PSU Never used the adapter I have had my 4090 a couple of weeks Been doing gaming and benchmarking I checked it a few days ago and so far so good but this has me worried
Card still works for anyone wonder he just dont wanna risk it Owner is my friend
Perhaps not a good timing buying anything ATX 3 0 display cards
Just wow This whole nonsense really lowers my motivation to upgrade my pc I guess i will just sell the still unopened 4090 for msrp and call it a day
Unrelated but I can t imagine owning a phone camera that watermarks its own insecurities on every single photo taken
This might be why EVGA hasn t released any PCIe 5 power supplies yet
Buy an ATX 3 0 PSU they
I have the MSI ATX 3 MPG A1000G PCI5 0 PSU with an MSI Gaming Trio Can confirm there is an audible click when inserting and it is a solid connection Been running for a week now with no issue Curious to see what NVIDIA's findings are
Don t forget to send this to gamers nexus too for more data
EVGA is sipping Mai Tais and enjoying the beach
Drove 2 hrs to my nearest microcenter to buy an ATX 3 0 PSU fuck me face with tears of joy
Do you recall when connecting the connector to the gpu if it clicked in or not
I'm more and more convinced that NVIDIA will cap the power draw to a maximum of 400W or less in a future driver release If you see on a graph what you get from 70 power draw to 100 it's usually what you'd get from overclocking
OP has update a new post He bought 4090 and MSI Ai1300p on 10 22 installed them with native ATX3 0 cable Also make sure that connector has been installed correctly and tightly After knowing the bending cable will make the connector burnt he double checked that his cable isn t over bend Yesterday 11 4 his rog heilos case has been arrived and will be installed by the experienced computer store When installing the store found that cable has been burnt and the card works normally before that After burnt been found he temporarily uses adapter to test the card till the next Monday to reach out MSI to get the new card and psu He said after testing found that card still can run he had store the card back to box
F cking hell As I already said since the adapters are garbage there should be similar errors with the cables which are based on the same specifications We should wait for a gen 2 or be lucky
So Is not the adapters
at least for msi users there is VBIOS update for the 4090 series that should optimize the power draw however msi decided to lower the power overhead on my Liquid X it was 125 with shipped bios and after updating the VBIOS it is reduced to 117
Imagine how crazy it would have been if miners were still using GPUs
Am I the only one thinking that the issue might not be the cables or adapters but something on the cards themselves
Oh shit here we go
Uh oh is this FUEL FOR THE FIRE
Just told myself wait for the new psu atx 3 0 dont rush to buy yet the 4090 The new psu will be great And now after see this dont know even if to buy 4090 and psu 3 0 or just leave it and wait for 5090 Why is nvidia so quite They sell us somthing that dont completed or what What gonna be safe for 100 to use with 4090
Hmm well that's not great The prevailing theory seemed to be that this was a batch of bad adapter cables that just slipped into distribution and everything else was fine That's obviously burnt so there goes the prevailing theory If this is a problem with the connector on the board even if the problem is just bad mating giggity it becomes much more likely that Nvidia has to actually recall cards rather than send out new adapters I think we'll hear from Nvidia next week as at least in the US I believe they're approaching the legal limit of how long they have to notify customers of a problem Hopefully they have some idea what's happening at this point because tech journalists haven't really come up with a satisfactory explanation and this case raises serious doubts about the idea that it was just a limited number of defective adapters
Maybe putting 600 watts through 12 dinky little wires just isn't a good idea
This make me start to think about if the card itself randomly draws over 100W maybe up to 450 600W base on the power limit of the bios from a single or a few of pins instead of sharing the loading evenly across all 6 pins then whatever an adapter or a native cable may show the same melting symptom
Is it just me or do the metal contacts in the terminals that are melted look like they are further back than the ones that aren t melted This would point to a contact issue with the metal terminals that would affect any cable
Oh ffs
Very disturbing there's clearly multiple issues and even more unknowns hope too many early adopters aren't burnt pun intended
i still dont get the phone camera having a fucking watermark
When you installed the cable did you plug it in correctly and did it make a nice click
7900xtx it is then
It's one thing for nVidia to lose on price with the 4090 vs AMD 's something else if they have to issue a literal recall And for those thinking this don't happen to Halo products for it's time the Galaxy Note 7 was the Best Phone ever and it was still the best phone I had 's gonna hurt
Ahh yes the roller coaster hell just keeps on going downhill But it's a nothingburger right guys Heh sweats
I'm out man This is too much of a risk to take on a 1700 2200 GPU AMD's cards look like they will be more than enough for gaming for the next 2 3 years Not worth burning down my desktop or house
Damn this is was my question about a week back if we would see the 12v cable to GPU and still melting It s going to be awhile before they figure this out 7900 XTX look like it might be my card this build both on price and safety
Dude I also got the Xiaomi redmi note 11 pro 5g global
we are discussing right now to stop selling those native ATX 3 0 cables till this has been resolved if we decide to pause selling those then we will make an announcement BTW this does NOT affect our very SAFE 3x8PIN 4x8PIN to 12 4PIN cable solutions but ONLY native ATX 3 0 16to16pin cables
Not suprising considering the plug is basically the same on native cables and adapters
Im starting to think it is the connector or something else in the GPU PCB that causes the issue in some units This means every 4090 is either a lottery ticket or a time bomb Either one Nvidia and AIBs are royally fucked Gigabytes come with 4 year warranty imagine other AIBs also have long warranty
Damm I really thought I was safe using a native cable with my new MSI PSU I really don't want to stress about burning my house down and risking my family If I knew about this before purchasing the card I wouldn't have bought it until everything was resolved
We need Gamers Nexus to see this
Wow I m so glad I didn t spend 50 on a cable mod cable before the actual issue is discovered and the manufacturer comments The amount of panic and sales generated for cable mod was absurd
Absolutely not related but your phone makes a watermark on photos i don't know if you noticed already
If we get more occurances of native cables melting that shit will officially hit the fan I assumed this was an adapter issue as everything pointed to it making the solution fairly simple once the underlying cause was identified send new adapters If however this is an actual 12VHPWR issue then things might reach full recall scale
NVIDIA out here like We dont need to do QA they will buy it and then do it for us
Man I'm sitting here reading you guys debate what could be the real problem when all I'm thinking is why did nvidia launch this card with this problem to begin with
Nvidia should just pull the entire 4000 series holy
This PSU has been delisted on Newegg It was up last night
I was aiming for the exact same PSU to buy now this is even more discouraging I'm even afraid to disconnect my msi 4090 Liquid X and to check out the state of my 12VHPWE adapter Worse of all I sold my previous msi 3090 Gaming Trio X I should have kept it longer
This may be why Corsair has held off on refreshing stock of their cable
Extremely appreciate you posting the melted cable connector and the power supply Do you have any pictures to the connection of the GPU and how it was set up in your case And what case you were using would be helpful as well Were you overclocking or was it at stock settings I'm not going to lie it would be extremely hard for me not to avoid my warranty and slice that Cable open Sorry for the s situation keep people updated hope things get resolved in a favorable fashion
Contact Gamer's Nexus and see if they'll investigate
I m so happy I got my first ever Pc with a 3080 I really feel like it was a perfect generation Even had bizarrely cheap prices all things considered
So even the new pcie 5 0 psu dosent work with that devil cable port This is fire hazard Eu price
S 'll be waiting to get a new GPU AMD looks promising but we'll dammit
Anyone power limiting their 4090 to 70 80 for awhile until we know what s up
I'm not an expert but I think there is something wrong with the RTX 4090 itself bad implementation of the base model some wrong component etc There are a lot of cables adapters and all are prone to be melt Maybe the problem is the graphics card any bad design causing that damages All the videos I've seen trying to replicate the problem are far to be a real life usage as they use expert equipment open air benchs and other stuff that no one of us use daily I wish NVIDIA to be more communicative with us
As a counterpoint I also have the MSI MEG Ai1300P and an ASUS TUF 4090 w a mild OC since launch and my connector is since it appears to be high quality
I think I'm going to sell my unboxed 4090 how long until the xtx comes out
This make me think it might actually not be a cable issue Maybe it s a issue on the gpu end
found evidence of this a week ago but mods hid removed it
Holy shit This is dangerous as fuck
imagine spending like 1k on a phone and the camera just has some shitty watermark on it lmao
Damn i have the 1000w one of the same psu should i be worried
You may be the first but you won't be the last
Geez what a nightmare Sticking to my trusty 3080ti
Thats it im gona skip this 4090 Which i need badly
gif giphy Keuz3JGkCbMUE downsized This is where the problem is When was the last time someone checked if they have constant power
I don't know why but the closed fisted method to hold the two cables just cracks me up
Also for the anyone who suspects OP s faking the cable here s the evidence You can found that is truly atx3 0 cable with burnt And he s wearing a pants not undies
This is insane that this is happening with such an expensive item
This is wild and clearly weakens the theory that it's just the adapters that are at fault here It may be something to do with the cards themselves I smell a recall in the future
These are poop gpus
this settles the question for me I'm simply not going to buy any hardware that uses the 16pin garbage I really hope some versions of RTX 4080 come out with 8 pins instead
Well that s discouraging
I'm having flashbacks to brittle SATA data connectors that I used to have to secure with epoxy
In no computer expert but that seems like a fire hazard and I would recommend going back to something that won't burn your house down
Yeah I don t know if MSI is my go too for power supplies
Mark my words they are going to power limit that sucker with a driver bios update
You know what I think that would fit nicely on my Dreadnaught I've always thought his 6x bolter wasn't enough menacing
Let's assume the problem is not the adapter connector but its the video card It would explain why testers cant replicate the problem of the the melting of the connection even Because the tester would be using the same video card or two
class action soon
Why did Intel and the PCI SIG even design the 12vhpwr standard How did it even make it to ratification
Un oh I'm thinking 'Zoid was more on point than people realized
I give up I bought the same PSU to avoid this issue and now I'm out 200
OP I think you should get your friend to give a picture verifying that it's the native adapter because lots of people think this is fake Imo the position that it's fake is ridiculous but it is what it is
Not gonna lie i'm legit afraid to make a purchase
Side and bottom pins only Looks like a bad connection to me not adapter one
I'm never gonna change my 1050Ti
I specifically have not installed my 4090 as I have been waiting for my ATX3 0 power supply to arrive as I don't want to use the Nvidia extension cable Worrying to see that native cables could also be impacted
If you have read the original post the GPU and cable were installed by a computer company with lots of experience installing 12vhpwr and they are fully aware of the 4090 incidents It was not done by a 1st time PC builder The chance of user error is very small
The very notion that no one has been able to recreate these failures in testing Gives me alot of pause when looking at these posts So many factors can be attributed to why an individual cable does this Very reputable people have thoroughly and rogoursly tested and tried to recreate these burn cables and were not able to As well if you think about the sheer number of cards that are out there we would really need to see what the real numbers really are
Oh damn this is
Oh no the shilltubers shaking rn
That's it it's too much I'm out Really does Quality Control is this hard Really looking forward for the competition this year 2 8pin legacy cable never looked so sexy
Imagine being a 4090 owner and having that looming deep down constant fear of whether or not todays gonna be the day the card decides to melt the pins and possibly burn down your house I imagine that every 4090 owner is not going to leave their computers on when they aren't at home after seeing all this No more overnight downloads or leaving the PC on to finish an important system update Oh Windows 10's gotta install a vital system update and you cant shut down Gotta stay at home and let it finish or else I leave and risk coming back to my entire PC or worse my house being burnt to the ground
Not to be rude but this looks fake The native cable I have looks nothing like this neither do the cables look like his on the product page This is pure bait
Uh oh
this should be first burnt connector with native ATX3 0 cable report by my client camera
Uh oh
maybe too much power in a really small conector wasn't such a great idea
Well that's what happens when you try to squeeze 600W through thin metal crimps
Has anyone who experienced this filed a complaint with the CPSC to start an investigation and potentially stop sale force a recall I find it hard to believe no one has but why are people trying to figure this out online
IDK Im running an aftermarket adapter on my watercooled 3090ti with an unlimited watt BIOS Im pulling way more than these 4090 cards and Im
Keeping my 3090 for this gen feels so much better every single day
Actually taking my money to AMD as a rationale human being I want a bit better 4K performance than I have with my 3080 ti the 7900xtx I believe will be faster and I can use my 8 pin on my Corsair Ax1600i without the fear of a 2000 scalped graphics brick I have 2300 in my PayPal as I type this I could stockx a 4090 right now but even as a fan boy I rationalized selling my 700 psu to buy a pcie5 0 psu to be safe and for 3 days I've debated this seeing this pushed me over the personal edge I could just get a 3090 ti and wait but it's ridiculous man I may have the cash but I legitimately can't AFFORD a 2K brick I was willing to burn money on my electrical bill but not with the actual hardware Damn man what is going on with Nvidia AMD feels like the Twilight Zone
Glad I am waiting to see ALL the competition before pulling the trigger
What a cluster fuck Thank you everyone who is beta testing this new connection type
I have the exact same 1 000W MSI PSU arriving Monday and I ve had an unboxed MSI 4090 Gaming Trio sitting on my table for over a week I even bought a new Corsair iCUE 7000X RGB chassis just to fit this monster What do you guys think Return all 3 items and wait till nextgen
You know I was a little concerned that I should ve waited like a month or two to buy a 4090 but I m very much happy with my 3090 at this pointface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
Oooo The plot
The very notion that no one has been able to recreate these failures in testing Gives me alot of pause when looking at these posts So many factors can be attributed to why an individual cable does this Very reputable people have thoroughly and rogoursly tested and tried to recreate these burn cables and were not able to As well if you think about the sheer number of cards that are out there we would really need to see what the real numbers really are
Not saying it is fake this cable does not look like the ones on msi's product photos Those don't have any fabric But product photos are not always correct
I really ask myself how is it allowed to sell a product that is a hazard can t it catch fire if you don t notice it and leave it running while not being close
Well this is worrying wondering whether I should cancel my preorder of the thermaltake gf3 and wait until we know more
Ok I m beginning to feel like this whole story is just a bit fishy We have 5 posts a day about it for a weekend Every single tech YouTuber and even legends of the power supply industry like Jonny rigorously begin testing insane conditions for these cables People swinging their PSU s around by the cable cutting wires running double loads in 100 degree rooms for 48 hours intentional poor contact etc Yet nobody at all including Tech Jesus can recreate the issue Then we get this story out of nowhere with a conveniently vague cable photo after the story seemed to have disappeared Everything about this whole story is just super fishy
I have this PSU and 4090 and have had zero issues
And the pci e connector had the proper terminators as well not the double slit ones that Buildzoid talked about so another theory down the drain then by the experts
I m going to go with it wasn t fully plugged in or seated correctly
Surprise kids don't know how to plug in native or adapter cables
rolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughing
width 3024 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 66f561517d7481e84ac6a53bf89af5a22891dd6d I wanna add something to all this without being pro nor contra Hooked my Suprim X 4090 up to the new asus rog strix Loki 1000w via the nativ 12pin cable that comes in the box I actually find it pretty good looking and mine has a steep bend because else it won t fit in the lian li 011d with the side panel on I have no problems nor melting on either end for now and tested a lot for me atleast D some benchmarks and about 47 hours in MW2 still everything fine I really don t know if it s just my luck or we only hear about the people with problems Before my Loki arrived I had it connected via the Nvidia adapter though did not close the side panel because I was afraid but also no problems for about 3 weeks
I come from a car audio background 600 watts at 100 efficiency and 12v is 60 amps of current That's an awful lot of current for those small pins Any non perfect connection is going to heat up too much Will most likely heat up with perfect connectivity because of the resistance that small pin is putting on the current
Could the be an issue with transient power If the 4090 is demanding unlimited power enough times could that be causing things to slowly melt
Well if this is true and the problem wasn't just a batch of low quality adapters I think that we are going to see a recall of all the 4090 We have a new Galaxy Note 7 situation
OH NO If this isn't a one off then this is a huge deal
Why all the downvoting
What an absolute shitshow lol
Wow this cable is fiasco Terrible
Now shit is hitting the fan
I'd like to see a Megathread of picures from just how the cables are plugged in I bet all these melts are caused by not plugging it in all the way
I can t see completely the whole cable yall should take better pictures or videos cable is always covered by his hand and this picture looks like he s using the showing the Nvidia s adapter width 828 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s d7a6d7115cf8870676d3dfbe7f152d2c2b3b1c07
Could nvidia be looking at a class action lawsuit I can t imagine this issue hadn t appeared in testing
Uh ohhhh nvidia did a bad
How did you have it plugged in
im starting to regret selling my unopened 3080ti at a loss when i got a 4090 order in at launch day
Dun dun dun
Fack no one can repro this shit wtf is going on
This connector is a disaster
It's a burned Nvidia Adapter in his hand Look the tape of the cable The native MSI cable doesn't have that He also never shows the cable itself only the plug Most likely fake or misleading at best
thanks for beta testing 2500 gpu
Damn you holding those cables like you're holding
This is going to end up with all the 20 and 30 series owners getting dlss 3 0 support early when nvidia is forced to recall all the 40 series cards and delay their release by months
As buildzoid mentioned in his videos the new 12 pin connectors are inherently worse than the regular 8 pin connectors Just imagine instead of 3 x 8 pins now you only have 12 pins which is half of the total number of pins This makes the overheating and then melting of connectors much more likely for a 450w of power or more Based on just this simple fact all of these 12pin connectors are much more likely to fail compared to the multiple 8 pins for power delivery We can expect overall much higher failure rate compared to the old pins and this could add up by time
And here we
Garbage ass pos 2000 dollar fire hazard anyone
Something doesn t seem right about this post I don t believe it
Not to stir the pot here but I believe the vast majority of the cards and adapters are completely fine Are we actually sure that the image above is melting damage and not another problem Could there be a defect further on down the cable that is causing this particular issue if it's confirmed melting I've seen dozens of pics of early stage melting which seem to be entirely scuffing from inserting the connector It's a scary problem to worry about absolutely More than it should be for such an expensive card Fire hazards are never okay But we also need to keep the numbers in context here I've been running a GB 4090 Gaming OC card for a few weeks now with the original NVIDIA adapter bent the wrong way and no issues with continuous 400 power draws for hours on end Yes my comment is N 1 but so are most of these None of the popular testers techvangelists and YouTubers have ever been able to replicate a melting incident There's a ton of speculation and noise but no hard replicated information So there's a lot we don't know Engineers all over the planet are soon to be working on this It'd be great to keep the speculation to a minimum until repeatable actual information and conclusions can be drawn Yes I know we're on reddit 90 of the entire site is speculation and derived discussion But I'm going to go out on a limb that MOST people that get a card like this will not experience a failure just like most people who go and buy a car will not encounter a defect with a failing braking system Both happen both are catastrophic but both are generally well contained in their occurrences
I'm gonna switch to the 7900XTX faster than I can say Hi
Using Intel Arc A770 make me feel safe No need to worry about the 12vhpwr adaptor issues
This is what happens when you don't plug things in properly
That's worse than a lot of the ones I have seen although I don't know if it's better to have more pins melted like yours or just be a lot of heat in one or two pins
Awh fuck me as my shiny new a1000g sits in a box on my table still in shrink wrap I have been using the adapter with no issues gonna press my luck a second time and continue with the build this afternoon
So its not the pins
The plot thickens
Turn off the watermark on your camera
Why is op in his undies
EVGA Save US We are all sinners lol We are all burning in hell for root of evil money EVGA take it all empty our pockets
Amd gonna fuck this quarter
And so it
So this just became a whole lot more of an issue than just some bad adapters
The burned terminals seem to be slightly recessed compared to the others could this just be a case of the terminals not being properly set in the plug like we've seen from some be quiet cables
MSI isn't a great company when it comes to quality so I am not
Johnny Guru already did a shit load of testing probably more than anyone we know of that does reviews and testing Johnny could not replicate the problem What if the problem is actually the way the boards are designed themselves What if some small component fails and it causes a pin to ask and draw for more power over the other pins This is the only thing I can think of after all the test many others have done lately
Noooooo Could it be that the atx3 0 soldering points are made the same that in the NVIDIA adapters
You know what I am so happy that I never pulled the trigger on 4090 or tried to This is just stressful for the 4090 owners
At this point I'm just gonna power limit my 4090 to 50 percent to not even melt
A good chance for people to take a hard look at their chassis airflow finally People should start considering something like the Fractal Torrent
shoulda got a dark power pro power supply best power supply and they have the custom pcie5 cable
the 5th pic shows the burn connector has fabric tape like the adapter that comes with 4090 Native connector don't have this fabric tape if this is really the native cable then its concerning nk950357 are you able to share a video of the actual connector and the cable
LMFAO
Meanwhile ocd 6950xt rips 550watts with zero complaints all day
Damn Nvidia they really need to do a massive recall of these cards like asap and just scrap the 40 series all together The power these cards draw is just too crazy
It could have been worse it could have been a Gigabyte PSU On a technical level the 300W combi 600W cables are good so once again I'm guessing this is down to user error
does he say if the cable was bent or despite following recomendations still got burnt
Week ago I mentioned how AIB partners messed up actually PCB How come FE models do NOT burn There is problem somewhere with PCB
Everybody wants the fastest most powerful GPU As it turn out there is a limit to it all
REDMI NOTE 11 PRO 5G
So good
Occam s razor states that a large portion of these incidents are due to a loose connection More capacitance high wattage heat ATX connectors are very finicky ESPECIALLY when the cable and or card are on the edge of their tolerance limits and many people are scared to plug them in with too much force I would be willing to bet this person had a loose connection either from a tolerance issue making it difficult to fully seat or a shitty cable The idea that the cards or ATX spec itself are flawed is highly unlikely
Haha That's all I can say now Sorry
Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G
The pics don't show that is a native ATX3 0 cable
Wait wait wait this might not be because of the adapters after all Could it be bad power delivery Something to do with electric provider's bad voltage spikes Or aging psu capacitors maybe
Am I the only one who doesn't give a fuck about the cable burning I still got a warranty and I made sure I pressed this mf cable in hard enough Even a MB cable is easier to put in tough I got the 16pin to 3 8 pin adapter Gainward 4090 I can only recommend it
Yea i dont feel sorry for him Pay 1600usd for a card and fuck the market up and keep this shit show going only to be burned this is why we cant have nice things
Great news
Fucking androids with their stupid watermarks on photos
I suspect it is the plastic material they are using that is melting Some can handle the heat and some can't
I wonder if this will happen to the MSI mpg a1000g too I know a few people on here have that model with 4090's
The thing is the same company in china that made the adapter maybe did this one since it's pretty new they aren't many supplier for it Question still rise why 3090ti adaptor don't burn up i know it's a different manifacturer so I mean Gigabyte did have exploding PSU
Any materials science engineers out there What kind of contamination would need to be in the board pins before they started to provide enough resistance to provide a voltage drop and dissipate heat
Def looks more like a bad connection than anything else but either way sucks to see
I returned my 4090 to best buy the other day and could not be happier with that decision Damn 1600 fire hazard
I thought this was a known issue with the rushed 3 0 power supplies
This is the first MSI PSU one when did that thermaltake one with a native cable come out
Here we go
Same supplier maybe I wonder how many suppliers are making 12VHPW cables adapters included
Of course this gets posted 2 days after I finally buy this power supply and order the cable mod Kit FUCK
W What a Fucking PREPARE FOR NEXT GEN GRAPHICS CARD SAFETY The native 16 pin PCIe 5 0 connector helps ready the power supplies for Nvidiaregistered GeForce RTXregistered 40 Series graphics cards
Do Redmi phones usually watermark the photos you take
I'm waiting for the 4080ti
Yikes gif giphy TK3rGWsMITCAQ5iNEX This is me with my beloved 6900 XT watching along with curiosity on where this goes from here
Hey dose this have 2 or 4 sense wires on the cable Iv saw two types of 12vhp cables out
is this a 600w or 450w card what were the other burnt
Anybody not wondering why even one Founders edition card hasn't had these issues yet
This is starting to worry me I have a 4090 and initially I was thinking that of course there would be a couple of people that would do things that are unsafe and would cause strange issues but this really is starting to become widespread I hate having to think about the what if scenario of my computer catching fire
The 12vhpwr cable that came with the PSU
I've honestly come to the conclusion that we have reached a wall now in terms of how to move forward with power draw I don't think these native cords can truly support the conditions a 4090 requires at optimal workload Nvidia IMO needs to do a major recall and redesign theit method of drawing power
Who makes these PSUs Msi is not the first brand I'd pick for a PSU
I have a 1000w GF3 with no issues Everything is fully plugged though
ah yes dropping 3 wires and increasing the gauge and increasing the current never would have guessed this was gonna be a problem
I hate to go this route but couldn t this be someone just looking to start shit Who s to say that the burnt connector he s showing IS from the PSU cable and not the adapter There s quite a few of us with ATX 3 0 PSUs and zero issues This whole deal has been quieting down and a day after AMD announces their cheap cards we get this Great timing
Ah damnit I just upgraded to an ATX 3 0 power supply in anticipation of getting an RTX 4090 I was hoping that would save me from the issue
Yea I am going red for the first time I couldn't handle the stress of my 2000 euros GPU bursting into flames D
It's getting hot in here so take off all your sleeves
I have to assume engineering wise the smaller cable design made sense but practically how did this get past QA checks Seems like if Intel wanted to push the 12V PSU standard now would be a good time seeing how hard it is going for this power connector
L 20
Look at the construction It is essentially a bus bar with tapped outputs Any loss by one is a total loss under full power The result is a cascading failure
Can we just switch to AS150 connectors and be done with this issue already grimacing face
Fuck
Nvidia and I
So the problem is isn't in the cable Buying expensive Cablemods and new PSU won't solve the problem 4090 is very costly
There is some good in this outcome as we can start ruling out the whole solder joint theory on the adapters as what is causing the problem Whatever it is now is present on the adapters and a properly crimp pinned cable One cable I would say isn't enough data but team solder joint should start packing their shit up to get ready to sit in the corner What makes this very concerning is that this is the first known case of it happening on the 3 0 cable which means the problem is no longer limited to just the adapters anymore
Yet another reason to stick with AMD with the standard connectors I'm making the upgrade from a 5700XT to a 7900XT or XTX when it comes out
Also how long has it been in your computer pics of the inside of your case what wattage you were at temperatures etc What were you doing and for how long How did you notice it Not making excuses but you've provided no details whatsoever
At this point I'm shocked So wtf is causing it because this one has oem crimped terminals and light ribbon type cable that bends easily So basically not so Very High PoWeR connector after all eh
Sue Intel
Damn I really wanted that power supply too smh Whered you buy it though Can't find it anywhere
It has the same number of pins as 2x 8 Pin PCIe connectors while also having smaller pins than PCIe Looks like the connector itself just can't reliably handle 450 W
Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G
How much time it took to melt Hours days minutes
So at this point aren t we better of using the adapter so if something happens we are at least covered by the warranty
What's the wire gauge in the 12VHPWR cable that ships with this Ai1300P PSU If not 16 could it be the cause for the melting connector
3x 8pin has 9 power lines with the same current capability per power line as on 12vhpwr 8pin can carry 300w or more we could have stayed at 3x 8pin and it would have been fine better actually
What power supply D of the time indicate a problem in power distribution No one is investigating this
How did you realized the problem Just checking or was there a symptom during use
Things just keep getting better for Nvidia And all of this nonsense just so cable management would look prettier rolling on the floor laughing
Is ok to switch to europlug I don t know
fuck gutted i am worrying about my card now seeing all these burnt cards and cables
In the picture it looks like the bottom left metal connector in pushed in a bit which could make more resistance
They should have gone with 4 pcie instead of one 12vhpwr cable which is flawed by design
Id like it if people could also start posting a picture of the side of their adapter that they insert into the GPU so we can see where they inserted it and if it was fully inserted correctly based on burn lines
Too bad it s not the first

I said this the other day For all we know it could also simply be a problem with the actual 12VHPWR connector in general not just the stupid adapter NVIDIA's pushed out Not many people own ATX 3 0 power supplies so it might look like an adapter problem for now simply down to more people having ATX 2 0 power supplies versus 3 0 ones There's so many variables at play here that it's too hard to put into perspective what the true issue is Seems it may be coming to fruition I hope this isn't the case We need more evidence and cases
Thing is we don't know May be the adapter AND the MSI 12vhpwr cable see what I mean We can't say it's the standard we can't say it's the card we can't say for sure it's just the
Yeah this is a big turning point now I wonder long term how these connections are gonna
I wondered about this because I saw someone speculating that because it was the end of the plastic and not the entire pin length that it meant the problem was the pins on the card Really crazy NVIDIA could have a recall on their hands for all we know
Damn the other brand is looking better to be honest I don't think I have the courage to buy an almost 2k videocard to be worried about that kind of issue Scary stuff specially for someone like me that changes builds every 5 years or
Everyone was jumping on the adapter theory since those were more likely to break due to shit quality control of the adapters and 99 still using their old PSU If those cablemod cables or native adapters are more durable they might simply take a while longer to break too We'll only find out in a few months what the real problem is If the connector generally can't handle the watts then the easiest solution would be to slightly power limit the GPUs with a software firmware update Most people already do that actually and the performance drops are small Highly recommended anyway if you have high electricity prices in your area
They are ok until they are not obviously they won t say it s not ok to use as they have a product to sell We may not accurately pin point what s really wrong but it s clear that the problem are those new 12VHPWR regardless if it s from the cable side or the gpu side man shrugging light skin toneto say otherwise is copium at this point
It is one out of however many I think saying this is not promising is hugely jumping the gun
Nvidia is basically one of the largest companies composed of the best electrical engineers in the world If this was a simple adapter problem Nvidia would've figured it out and had a solution within 12 hours of this becoming a known thing Every hour that goes by that they don't react dramatically increases the chances of something really bad happening and then being sued into the ground It was never reasonable to assume it was a simple adapter problem
Dont know why people are speculating when some of us have info straight from Nvidia and PCI SIG on how to connect the cable It was said on day one to avoid issues like this
Everyone needs to be careful with any connector to these cards Nvidia is running the connector at near its maximum current capacity Folks need to make sure connectors are fully seated and supported so there is no tension on the wires And it looks like we need to periodically check them which is problematic thanks to the low rated number of mating disconnect cycles Cables could become a consumable item Also anyone who has a connector melt may need to RMA the whole card High heat can also compromise the surface finish on the pins and set the male pins up to be the source of resistive heating
I checked my cablemod cable this morning I ve been using my card for close to 2 weeks extensively and there s no signs of damage
It is just the adapters
Im betting its a seating issue on the card itself
We've been selling these cables before the GPUs were up for sale even and have shipped a lot of 12VHPWR cables already around the world in fact You're safe with us
We've already sold and shipped loads of these cables we were selling them prior to the cards being available even All good with us
All it takes is one bad crimp Maybe it is time to move on from Molex connectors to a better design
Is Cablemod and others gonna show the same issue when enough are in the wild First time ive seen their name be mentioned and them not show up in a reply pimping their cables Nobody knows if it will happen but if someone does show off a burned cablemod cable a lot of their statements and sales pitches are going to age like milk
Read the JohnnyGuru write up It is just an educated opinion Do not take it as fact But the connector is probably not the only issue
Zero adapters have melted where the solder joints are All of them fail at the friction cable coupling
Shit that s the PSU I wanted Also where the hell did you manage to get this one It s not sold anywhere
Meanwhile Jensen is still silent on
Chinese user Likely using knockoff products I m not concerned
Confirmed that cable didn t bent hard But didnt take a screenshot of how it was plugged in A little sus on that one
The photos are intentionally misleading It looks like he s holding the adapter in the photo with both connectors in it The burned one looks like it has the same heatshrink material on it that the adapters have The native cable doesn t have that same construction I call bullshit Post unambiguous photos
Oh sweet guess it's a good thing both of my fire hazards are from MSI as well At least i know if my shit burns up MSI will want it ASAP i'll hold it ransom until new components are in my hand though
yes
That's actually great They better have an expedited new card in the mail and cover any damages to other components This is the game they choose to play for both parties involved
To only remain silent on the matter like Nvidia lmao
yeah im gonna hold off on this generations cards for sure Might even look into the AMD lineup come december
Paying that much for a GPU is already rewarding very anti consumer business practices and with the way Nvidia has been handling it there is no reason to expect anything better from
Or don't buy 4090
In this case 1800 whatever the cost to get the PSU I saw a lot of people commenting on previous burned adapter threads that they were willing to dump their perfectly fine existing PSU to get an ATX 3 0 PSU to work around the issue I hope those folks reconsider and wait to see how this plays out before ordering a new PSU
I paid AU 3300 for my 4090 and after checking there was no sign of problems all I ve had to worry about is whether my insanely high frames and graphics details makes me an unfair opponent online I swear my k d ratio in my fave shooters is through the roof since I got the 4090
People that blindly fork out that much money for a product with a new power connector rated at max 640 watts whereas the product pulls 600 should have done their due diligence before purchase
My Thermaltake GF3 1650W came with one defective 12VHPWR cable two pins on one end popped out similar to the right photo at the end of JG's article Though TT offered a return and a full refund since they don't have another one in stock but the other 12VHPWR cable worked fine so I decided to keep it This post really make me worried I just checked mine and it's still fine however
What cable are you using
I got the same PSU as you though I'm still on a 3080 Hopefully it holds when I eventually get the RTX 4090
Did your grammar overheat the same way the connector did
So it was also linked to the nvidia adapter over the original 16 pin original MSI connector from the power supply I mean videocard adapter MSI power cord bundle
Good you shouldn't compromise after spending almost 2000
He should contact Gamers Nexus
and perhaps get an RX7900XTX on December 13 for half the price and with standard connectors
It makes me feel not so bad about buying a 3070 Ti for nearly 1000 usd mid shortage
I was about to buy card and upgrade from 3090ti and now by looking at this post I will not buy this to burn my house I have kids and wife and they are more important to me than anything Maybe when they fix problem 6 month from now
Which 4090 model is it I'd potentially buy if you'd potentially sell
Return it to seller with the reason explained so Nvidia know that users are taking this seriously Selling on a potential fire hazard is unethical
15 social credit
You can turn it off in settings so this is question to owner
I doubt you'll see any Cablemod cases anytime soon The amount of people who will use those cables is going to be miniscule relative to the total sales of the 4090
There's only one gap in the metal contact area unlike Nvidia having two gaps So that's a factor saying this is better quality But there are other factors such as wire gauge and rated voltage which are not shown in the pictures
I received my 4x8 CableMod cable a few days ago I ll be monitoring it but yeah I bet those that purchased are fringe cases if ours burn up Also props to Cablemod the ModFlex is a pretty nice cable I could almost shut my case with it on but will wait for the 90 adapter
Given that this PSU is the absolutely top tier that s unlikely
Evga hasnt released anything 12vhpwr Seems they knew and pulled out lol
Yeah They released new ones recently but not the new spec
I think some people are not connecting these connectors properly that s why we re seeing those cases
I got an audible click at both ends too and there is no visible gap at all with the connections
At least you can get your hands on one lol
Exactly Mine clicks into place when it s properly seated and you can t wiggle or move it at all It s very secure
Nvidia would have to offer full refunds first Selling the card on its performance then limiting it after sales would not go down well
I think it doesn't matter few days ago someone mentioned his was undervolted and still burnt
The tolerances with the new connector are just a lot lot lower than with 8 pin and 6 pin connectors we used before Those were overengineered and the 12VPHWR ist the exact opposite It s more like running on the edge
Most likely its due to the type of plastic used might be some vendors took the 70C rating too literally its not difficult for the connector to reach and goes beyond 70C with pcb temp bad connection or other factor like hot ambient etc combined
My Strix is by default set to 90 Got it yesterday and first thing i noticed
Ye but what about performance
Mine came stock at 93 I can manually set it to 100 is AB but after a system reboot it reverts to 93
What is vbios you mean updating the mobo bios Doesnt that introduce its own complications
I hadn't heard anything about the vbios update Can you share some more details about it I'd love to push my 4090 to 600 watts if possible My limit is currently 450watts on the msi gaming trio
New tokens BTM Bitmelt and BTF and Bitfire
Only if the cards are drawing obscene loads The heat is concentrated in the cable side plug which implies that s where the problem is or at least the weakest link in the chain
At this point anything is possible man shrugging light skin tone won t be surprise if the card itself has issue like any other nvidia gpu release
Or not plugging in the connector properly as people have been literally shouting at everyone for the past week and everyone still wants to go FUD FUD FUD FUD
5090 will come with 2 12vhpwr connector haha
Hopefully it's not too late for AIBs to use the old connectors for 4070 and below next years
What makes this issue weird is that Gamers Nexus Igor Jay Jonnyguru all tried their hardest to make it fail but it didn't It makes me thing the real issue is people are not plugging their cables all the way in The connector needs to be forced into the socket to the point where it feels like it will break
Being a generation or two behind is a feature of AMD Enjoy your Ampere level RT performance A lot of angry fanboys hitting downvotes or just people angry at 4090 pricing
LOL I love when people say shit out of their ass as if it is fact Approaching the legal limit just no this doesn t exist
Should have tested that before launch
400 watts isn't that much especially spread among 12 wires The wires are really thick on this PSU The issue is the pins coming loose it appears Keep in mind 6 8 pin cables have been frying for years too this isn't a new thing
spoken like somebody who never ran 2 000 watts through two dinky wires to a subwoofer in the audio world they routinely run far far more wattage through much less you guys really don't know anything about anything do you
MSI cards are 450w
This is a good point If that is the case how to they solve this issue Can a vbios upgrade fix this
Asian thing they have weird phones lol face with tears of joy
Sure if you don't want the best Everyone knew the 4090 was going to be the performance champion 7900xtx is you're ok with 2nd or maybe 3rd place
Yup mainly safety lol face with tears of joy
You are as much in the dark as everyone else to the root cause Please don t tout your SAFE cables as a solution to an unknown problem No wonder we ve seen cablemod EVERYWHERE on NVIDIA Reddit recently
Confusing why wouldn't you just make 12vhpwr to 12vhpwr safer like you did with the OK 4x8 to 12vhpwr and 3x8 12vhpwr If its the 12vhpwr pcie 5 0 spec EVERYTHING is affected Also it's the first case and the pic can't even prove its the msi native cable It's wierd how no one can recreate any of these cables melting its like they are just not plugged in correctly and set to draw more power
Here we fucking go again my order's gonna arrive in 2024 Please man I know you guys wanna shield yourselves from that 1 out of 15 000 cases that will end up on reddit but come on I'm not blaming you I get it I totally do but this fear mongering is out of control
I have an order for a custom 16 to 16 If you decided to stop selling them temporarily will my order be automatically canceled I'd prefer not to have an expensive cable that is not guaranteed to be safe I'm contemplating just canceling my order regardless if possible
But why Because 1 shady post saying so Doesn t make any sense unless you know something more Native ATX 3 0s are supposed to be way more safe than the nvidia adapters
I was thinking the same thing We need 1 1 ratio cable wire to terminals and not this hodgepodge soldering job at the ends That in itself seems like a recipe for disaster with higher voltage and amps
I m in the same boat Just installed the 4080 with the msi mpg a1000g last night I heard audible clicks on both psu and at the card
They will And funny enough GN has tested tons of adapters and can t get a single one to melt
Yes please someone send this to tech Jesus
Yet we haven't seen any failures with our cables and we were selling them before the cards dropped and have sold a very large amount of them
Some Chinese phones have the feature with watermark such as Xiaomi OPPO etc
Yep thumbs up light skin tone some people may deny it cuz nothing has happened to them but that doesn t change the fact that it did happened regardless of where the fault is Luckily my card and psu from same brand hasn t arrive yet so I m just hitting the cancel button This shit isn t worth the money anymore and a total failure from nvidia part
They are probably investigating this whole situation right now at least everyone is hoping they are Nobody knows for sure what the problem could be As to why they released these
Yep all they have to do is put back the 8 pins and relaunch the 4090 and go back to the drawing board with intel and re design those new 16 pin cables
By delisted you mean sold out Big big difference
Take a leap of faith and check it you ll feel better I did Just make sure you hear a click once you plug it back in
Exactly the same as me I don t want to check in case it s going to go bad after that it seems to be ok now as in I don t smell anything burning lol So I follow the rule if it ain t broken don t fix it and hope for the best Not much else I can do now since my 3090 is gone already
Pull down the power limit until the situation is resolved Maybe good for peace of mind
I got my cable from Corsair 3 days ago It was immediately out of stock once I bought it in Singapore I've asked their team whether they have stress test it They said they did The cable is damn bloody stiff Hah
What It's been in stock many times since the 4090 released it sells out very fast
Yep that's what I've been thinking too
In stock now just ordered one Sold out
I m not the OP I m sorry I m not able to do that But in the original post someone has already recommended him to do that
I am honestly shocked they haven't If someone gets physically injured or hurt over this issue they are going to be in for a world of hurt and bad publicity
It can t be the 4090 it s self or thousands of units would have had this issue it must be a defective batch that went out Humans make errors and machines can mess up and it managed to slip by the processing line
It s only in stores on 13th Dec Seems like I ll hold off on the 4090 till at least then
The fact that I am even considering just ditching my 4090 at this stage is crazy This new connector is BS I know some are using it weeks and no issue but it kinda feels like its just a matter of time And how messed up is it when your thinking I hope my cable melts inside the warranty period
exactly what i am going to do
100 holding off to see the real World benchmarks for the XTX If they're anywhere near the AMD claims I'm jumping ship
I don t think NVIDIA s developer team will be that shitty More like the cable issue now I m more curious about how the MSI s ATX3 0 cable soldering point like in the connector
I honestly can t believe how often I see this shit now Are people trying to brag about what phone they have or are they ok with having stupid watermarks on all their photos
You can turn it off if you want to Also the phone cost only around 400USD
at least concerned
Depends on what GPU you have IMO Gamer's nexus and Jay2cents Both tried everything to burn cables adapters But they couldn't They were BOTH using FE cards
Or u could go amd if ur wanting for an upgrade man shrugging light skin tone
Why because 1 post This native PSU cable post hasn t even been confirmed People stop over reacting Thousands of us have 4090s now I have this exact PSU and the native 16 pin cable snaps locks into the 4090 making it very secure I literally just checked after 2 weeks of heavy gpu use and not a single issue
If the PSU mainly and GPU can't handle some minor variation in the wall outlet that's their fault not the GPU Power from the wall is never perfect
Finally a certain audience will shut up about it being fishy
Some renders has been out Unfortunately 4080 uses 16Pin too Maybe you can hoping 4070 i think there s a high hope not using 16Pin
You might as well call this your last gen of buying a GPU then It isn't an Nvidia connector It's the new ATX standard power connector
Very and it s not looking good for nvidia
Same I m usually evga or Corsair but this situation isn t an Msi issue only In fact Thais tells us that All 12VHPWR are possibly at risk and not just the adapters
Possible and it s the easiest and cheapest solution and if it works then all is good
Not a chance Most people aren't even raising the power limit or bought a crappy AIB card that doesn't even allow it This means 450W minus 20 30W over PCIE only pulls 35A across what's supposed to be a 50A connector Even with raised limits it isn't even powerful enough to draw much more than 40A If Nvidia's solution was to just lower it below even the advertised TDP they'd have a lot of explaining to do and a class action lawsuit to deal with They'd also have to explain the 450W 3090ti using the same connector
It s a possibility thinking face if the pins on the connector of the gpu are getting hotter than usual but wouldn t that also affect the card itself so people would notice if it is getting a bit hotter than usual
Nah Not until nvidia founds the real issue
Ever so baffling
They didn t expect it to have a issues lol
I would like so but truth is I really didn t know him XD I found the post in the group Also I don t think that msi will give him all the new thing if it was fake MSI has already prepared the new PSU and card for him picking them up next Monday editing the comment with less tautology
One person One
yeah who's to say some funny guys didnt decide to run a bic lighter over their pins lmao
Waiting for the posts saying my ATX 3 0 cable going strong nothing burnt here
Bye
Probably 3 for AIB but yeah amd has never look so shiny to me before I m probably out too for the entire 40 series if they keep using the same connectors It s not right to pay 1000 dollars on a 40 series card just so u can worry every time that it may melt
Yea not a very good feeling honestly face with diagonal mouthnvidia did a very good job making amd looks good
Don t be that full of doom it can t burn down a house But it can melt just the connector
Actually if it was crimped you wouldn't have a problem The issue is the soldered connections
So which one are u getting
looks like it too dangerous to get anything with the 12whpwr
We are on the same
I just bought a 3090 FTW3 for 770 shipped upgraded from a 1080 Ti and I am beyond happy
The review from Taiwan s reviewer wolfsi You can see that there s fabric in the cable
I believe it looks legit I'm using the same MEG Ai1300P and here's my cable for reference The fabric you're seeing is the tape around the end If you zoom in really close into his pictures and look at the terminal it also has 1 split instead of 2 splits like the Nvidia adapters
A poster above tkno SojlrOu above showed a picture of his cable and it has the fabric So the product photos seem inconclusive
I agree furthermore there are no pictures showing the complete cable I also think it could be fake
Well based on my admittedly very limited legal understanding they are not In the US they have 10 business days to conduct their own research then notify the government of a safety problem the reporting is confidential but once they report they can't continue to sell the product if it continues to be a safety hazard I don't know how much flexibility or legal loopholes there are there but we seem to be approaching the point where they've got to issue some guidance Unless they're somehow talking consumer protection agencies into this not being a fire risk
20 people got melted adapters 20 people tested it 20 000 people probably have it running fine The numbers don't lie and they spell disaster for you at Sackerfice
Try it the other way around could all those gurus and testers just be in on the damage control saying they haven t seen anything wrong while they do not show their actual cables letting us take their word for it I ve heard an opinion it was a ruse to lower 4090 sales but come on people are snagging them regardless
It points more to mfg aberrations than to conspiracy or mass hoax to me
so was every 4090 owners connector until it wasn't which is the whole problem no one knows why this is happening is it manufacturing errors it it the standard not being high enough to cater for voltage spikes is it user error is it uranus being under the influence of the moon These are quite expensive pieces of equipment that appear to be failing regularly for reasons as yet to be explained by the manufacturers or the standard setter This is why everyone is concerned don't think because your equipment hasn't failed that others have not or that yours will not in the future it is all a great unknown at the moment and it damn well should not be
I built this computer This is a fact
Check the connector
I bet it s faulty poscaps that couldn t successfully compromise the cards last gen so they succeeded this time around
The fact that this pin is in the middle is interesting
You only hear about the people with problems
It has better controlled transients than ampere according to Nvidia that s something they worked on
Transients are by definition transient Only sustained power causes heat
Transients have been shown to be more stable than the 3090Ti
It s a repost no info no specs and some questionable pics
At least you're not
Just check my comment I d already post the OP s video
If it was a NVIDIA adapter there would be double seams in the connector Instead its a single seamed connector means OEM or third party cable So its NOT an Nvidia adapter
if mine melts im getting a refund and going with amd's new card
Depends on how amd sale goes but I ve been seeing YouTube thumbnail about the new 7900xtx and amd fans seem to be not contented with the card
The million dollar question that half these folks don t want to ask
It is not an Nvidia adapter they have two splits in each terminal the one in the image only has one
It s 1 seam not 2 what are you talking about
So you're saying his adapter actually burned out like the other cases but he took the opportunity to pretend that it was the atx 3 0 native plug Why would someone do that
I agree with you the original msi one does use rubber heat shrinks not tape
I agree completely Smells like bullshit
Taco
We're not just talking about an inconvenience but a potential fire hazard so even a small percentage of shipped products with that kind of an issue is a major problem
ok now say this without cry
Nice You'll make someone happy that there is one less person to compete with to get a 4090
Yeah you feel safe at 10 times less performance
I have the same PSU and all my parts sitting in a closet Was going to put everything together this weekend but now I'm hesitant
Are you saying the GPU or PSU in this case both are MSI This MSI power supply is essentially the best consumer ATX power supply on the planet right now not sure on this MSI 4090 model though
If he couldn t replicate the problem then how do people replicate the problem non stop doing less intense things
no there isn't a solder here at all This is all about the pins
Na not really out of the amount sold and the what 20 30 cases it isn't that big of a deal Think of all the people who don't visit the subreddit and had no issues
If the cable will be melt then it will be melt whether the power is There s few burnt that happens on opening game or low load
How is chassis ventilation going to solve an electrical fault
this is ai1300p s atx3 0 cable and this is the video of entire cable posting by OP fs e s TIeQ9V
People have been running 450w bioses on 3000 series cards for years with out issue It's not the card power draw
Are you a professional shill or just an enthusiastic amateur
You need to swipe to see the other pictures
could it just be what numerous people have stated is a good possibility that people just aren't plugging the wires in fully
The question is what happens to the gpu after melting is it ok to operate with a new cable or not
Yes but it's not because you think you're fool proof or enlightened so it can't happen to 're the only one who doesn't give a fuck because you're an idiot
Nah you're not alone It's an inconvenience to send a gpu back but I have a spare so not fussed The internet sure does love its drama and pitchforks
Doesn't matter The PCB is the flaw causing the heat JohnnyGuru here shows the 2 reasons why they are melting 1 is the connector 2 is the pcb density being too thin Maybe a combination of the two things are amplifying the fact that it is settings cables on fires But 2 can never be fixed for cards that have been released already
And they would most certainly call out Nvidia if it indeed is a overall architecture issue Holding on to my EVGA 3080 for quite a while Side Note EVGA s queue was the only way I was able to cop a 3080 for retail Huge blow to the gaming industry smh
Are you going to omit that evga was the only manufacturer that had issues with vrms for the 10 series They did handle the situation well by sending out thermals pads to people but c'mon Let's not act like EVGA was some invincible Saint that wasn't prone to flaws
Johnny Guru said in his thread that he thought all of the adapters came from India due to tariffs
Breathe read all the comments This entire post is extremely questionable and has NOT been verified Check the mega thread Hundreds of us here have ATX 3 0 psu s and the native 16 pin cable is perfectly fine No need for a cablemod adapter either
That isn t my phone I m the reposter But what i can tell u is they usually have a option to enable watermark in settings seems those Chinese manufacturers all enable them by default
6900XT gif giphy 1BdJd24oEwvuSvXYb0
MSI 4090 Gaming x trio must be a 450w card According to OP only the connector of card and card side connector been burnt
Actually seems there s a burnt in Taiwan and it might be the first FE burnt v kUSl1hzR8L0 feature According to the user he bought from Nvidia then shipped to Taiwan Nvidia replied him rapidly and told him they need to check the card and adapter also they told him will return a new card or refund his money Yep he s using stock adapter He said that he s too nervous then he forgot to take a photo with cable
It s made by Channel Well Tech same with TT GF3
Go to check my comment had posted the evidence already
Maybe QC passed by checking whether if cable works or not
The power of the sun In the case of my pc
Could be other issues with the cable that came with that PSU or the PSU itself
And yet intel doesn t use the same cables lol face with tears of joy intel played nvidia
I mean I'm really not sure why this is surprising when the original PCI SIG leaked memo detailed the 12VHPWR connectors failing on the PSU end This is something that should have been expected if the issues the testing revealed were valid I think it's also important to note that these native cables have the exact same 12VHPWR connectors at both ends and if it's the connectors that are problematic you'll have double the failure points with native cables That means the native cables might end up being even more unsafe than the adapters
Except the connector has been tested with real loads from non GPUs for months at this point I'm suspecting something wrong in firmware or bios causing uneven loading on pins we don't really know how the 12v plane is wired on the cards and it could be that certain pins are drawing too much power under certain circumstances For example is all 600w of power is only coming in over half the pins and the other half are idle then you are over double what is expected There have been power loading issues with partner cards in the past EVGA had an issue with early 30 series PCBs and power load imbalance that resulted in lower than expected power draw overall so a failure in a safe way This might just be an extreme case of that
Not that many variables honestly This should have been caught in testing They don t understand their customers That s a big red flag
I criticised star forge pc selling company for jumping the gun in customer care and changing their pc line up with cable mod cables and bigger cases We don't know what's happening we can't jump on solutions yet The adapter theory was sketchy from start Buildzoid clearly said pins are melting not adapter joining area Anyway pins are in parallel so higher resistance means lower heat generated because current is reduced But people assumed fixed current value and kept jumping to conclusions Jayz was the worst one He read one igorslab article and made big videos about finding the issue just like last time they blamed capacitor choice for stability issues in 3080 It was fixed with drivers not hardware fix
All in all I hope nvidia is going to honor all of the returns
The constant variable are the cards themselves
So its just a matter of time and the cablemod cable will burn too
Not an nVidia product owner but you might be right I've read around from other folks on Reddit and tech youtubers that the new connector requires a non insignificant amount of force to be plugged in properly I wouldn't be surprised if this fault leads to poor connection between the pins because the connector isn't seated properly leading to very high thermals less surface to transmit all the power to the point of melting outright the connector
I said the same thing a week ago and got downvoted for contradicting the holy YouTuber papal authorities
I had evidence of this being the case a week ago but the mods deleted hid it
I think what may contributing is people not applying enough pressure to push the cable all the way in It requires some force Much more than normal pcie cables and the click is also faint I know because I got a 4090 myself and thought it required quite a bit of force but since I work with electricity for a living I made sure the plug was fully in I haven't had any issues personally Still using the adapter and have been gaming a ton The plug doesn't get hot or anything either Just speculation on my part
How could they have predicted that transmitting the same amount of power down a 12 pin 3 0mm pitch connector that would normally be sent through 4 8 pin 4 2mm pitch connectors would create problems Seems pretty unpredictable
Exactly So all we have to go on is Reddit and the evidence that is presented Since we don't 100 know anything for sure all we know is the adapters are definitely burning and a cable has now made its way to the list If we extrapolate this out It just doesn't look good as there are many many more people using adapters than native cables or even 3rd party adapters One burnt cable is hardly a statistic but in this context it's looking very likely Like you said we don't know But we have 4090 so we have to try to do something right So we try to pick the best option we have available with the evidence we're given Edit spelling Also edit man I love my 4090 Seriously it's amazing and really efficient under 350 watts BUT they need to say something about this soon tell us something Anything I don't leave my computer on when I'm not home anymore because of this And this means I can't stream to my steam deck without fear of something happening when I'm not home If it comes to it I will return this to micro center and get an AMD card because having a awesome GPU isn't worth much if I can't use it normally Thank God for micro center's warranty I don't want to do that and I really want to keep this card so I hope something gets presented soon because I really want to get back to streaming to my deck when away
Very badly Specially if you see signs of failure with a card that is being out for less than 3 months Can you picture what will happen in 2 years
Just the melting connectors makes it a good bet that a recall is coming and will be forced on Nvidia if they don t act on their own I have to wonder how many are out there now where owners are oblivious to the danger have melting issues already and don t know it and have no clue there could be a problem
If u change every 5 years then u may as well go the safer route and change to amd this time as they are still using the old connectors with better cards
Realistically you should be fine if you switch to AMD a 4090 is definite overkill
AMD 7900XT and 7900XTX went with the old 2 x PCIe 8 pin connector And we know for sure those connectors WILL NEVER fail
But that's the whole point This new standard is so tight Smaller junction smaller pins smaller contact area smaller retention mechanism That anything that could somehow fail in the build quality could make it fail big time On the other hand the old PCIe 8pin connector is so sturdy and build with so many safeguards than even if a connector is not built perfectly it is very difficult to make it fail
People needs a way to cope by blaming something and feeling safe by using something else hence the adapter theory But this rate I m not surprise if the problem is on the gpu side and it s only a matter of time before 3rd party cable or native cables starts melting
I don t know what your background is but I can easily see how this happened First there have been references to subcontractor s making the cables and not Nvidia Somebody didn t do their homework or make sure the cables were built properly When a product launch is looming people are trying just to make sure there is a product to launch and fine points can be missed The Nvidia adapter is a bad design from the get go They used a connector with virtually no headroom or margin for error so that just makes everything else more critical Then they used textbook bad construction techniques Solder is a soft metal alloy that can crystallize when flexed and fracture Solder is all that holds Nvidia s cables to the connector They also soldered all the connector tabs together Those pin sockets are supposed to float in the plastic housing Soldering prevents that won t let the pin sockets adjust as connectors are mated etc A whole host of real issues in the Nvidia connector When CPSC is done with Nvidia I bet there is a recall on the Nvidia adapters at a minimum You don t have to trust anything I say but electronics in one way or another was my entire career It s easy for things to get lost and to assume someone else made sure the connectors were good But how they let a connector get by that was pushed to near max capacity is a good question Somebody made a hugely consequential bad decision at that point and a design review should have caught it The connector choice itself may have been ok but it made everything else critical even with proper cables adapters it now seems assuming the cable shown here was top quality but it may not have been There should have been two connector bodies used for these cards The HOF card apparently needed two but the 4090s do too
Then why is this happening in the first place Just because they are the best in your opinion doesn't mean much your whole point is kinda invalidated by the fact this is happening at all We don't know anything for sure yet Could ba an adapter problem and one faulty cable Idt that's it but it's reasonable to think that Edit I agree with most of what you said except it was never reasonable to think it was an adapter problem That was is a very reasonable thing to think until they say something Yes as time goes on it looks worse and worse
And yet issue are coming up even with the people taking extra precaution
I bet you the guidance on being careful with bends and such is because Nvidia knew there were issues It was a hail Mary in hope that there wouldn t be these drumbeat reports of failures in people s computers It may point to advance knowledge of the issue and if it is that could compound Nvidia s liability if anyone gets hurt or killed because of this
I got called an idiot and downvoted to all hell just for considering that as an option down this comment thread
I've got one on the way from you guys I hope this is the solution and it's not a fundamental flaw with the 12vhpwr connections on the GPUs themselves Each day that passes while Nvidia says nothing causes more speculation about exactly how bad this situation is
I m not the OP I just repost it Also there s some country available right now Taiwan costs around USD 308
I got my Ai1300P the first day it went up on newegg and haven't seen it go back in stock since I have it powering a strix 4090 After all the videos started popping up I checked my cable ends everything has been fine so far even with multiple hours of gaming Have checked everything a few times with a thermal gun and haven't seen any high temps Hoping this one was just a one off
don't buy MSI power supplies
This is the PSU I m looking for as well not good
I just bought one at MicroCenter yesterday
Got this exact PSU delivered yesterday grinning squinting face
Really hoping Nvidia addresses 's
Hard to talk when you got your mouth stuffed full of 100s
Peasant problems are beneath Jensen
He won't respond until the stock price drops which seems really unlikely
If they were just checking to see and expecting to find nothing why would they take a picture But yeah they could have not seated it properly damaged the GPU and cable due to their own negligence and are trying to get the warranty to cover
We have plenty of proof the regular nvidia adapters had issue but with this native 12vhpwr for all we know it wasnt plugged in all the way We would need more examples preferably with pictures of the setup before it burned
You can literally see that these don't have the double slit connectors that are charateristic of Nvidia's adapters Not sure why you're trying to stir shit
Most PSU's are made by the same manufacturers the AIB's just slap their own logo's on them There's very few PSU hardware manufacturers So if you switch to say Corsair chances are you are getting the exact same brand just with a different AIB logo case design It's kind of like system memory where there's a million different brands but all of the memory chips are made by just three companies Samsung SK Hynix and Micron so it's more of an illusion of choice
OP mentioned it's their friend's card in Taiwan MSI is based there so they really can do door to door pickup
Tbh MSI if the issue is a standard that MSI must implement then Nvidia and PCI SIG need to speak about it not MSI
Give them time to investigate Normally companies and investigative agencies don't make public statements until they finish their investigations Nvidia will probably finish their investigation sometime in December
7900 XTX Looks impressive especially for 999
Please do This fear is good It will hopefully affect stock so that anyone with half a brain will buy one Objectively non arguable speaking this is worst case scenario a 0 5 incidence rate which is still huge but really really small Keep the fear mongering up stock's gonna hopefully be good and instead of these cards landing in the hands of idiots they'll go to people with some brain cells
I paid AU 3300 for my 4090 and after checking there was no sign of problems Yet all I ve had to worry about is whether my insanely high frames and graphics details makes me an unfair opponent online Low settings are better from a competitive standpoint Fancy graphics don't help that's why pros play on medium low most of the time You don't need dramatic lens flare and lush grass when picking out an opponent You just need high frame rate high draw distance and the minimum effective setting to allow for things like shadows etc I swear my k d ratio in my fave shooters is through the roof since I got the 4090 Doubt
Have an upvote
The product is speced for 450W Just because some make it possible to overpower it by 33 and some users think that is a selling point doesn't mean those who blindly buy a product from a company they have trusted for many years are the dumb ones
Your PSU came with 2 12vhpwr cables I have the 1000w version and mine didn t
I've just had my GF3 1650W delivered yesterday I can't use it yet because it only contained a Euro power lead Which GPU are you using
holy what a waifu case
I think the cable just burned up from pure shame at being used in this case
someone really likes hoshino from blue archive
They're both Chinese neither are Native speakers Nice one dumbass
It is an Asus 4090 OC bought for msrp in the Asus Webshop
I honestly doubt that Asus is going to take the card back i am outside of the return period sadly If someone buys it i will make sure he has heard about the problems and knows what he is buying though the person will most likely know about the adapter
Wire gauge doesn't matter here If the wire gauge was the issue the wire would have melted not the connector
Oh fuck I really hope MSI didn't cheap out on the god damn wire size I have the a1000g sitting on my counter at home any way to tell the gauge without ripping up the sheathing
Thank you for your support happy to hear you're enjoying the ModFlex as well 3
Top tier does not have to be good cables or soldering job The 4090 has a top tier price and still shipped with faulty adapter
Based on what Seasonic and EVGA don t have any 3 0 units out yet There s probably a reason for that
A 4090 is top tier
No They re in the process of making 12vhpwr to 4x 8 pin cables Straight from Jacob freeman
How often do power cables typically melt And what are the odds this cable melts in the exact same way in the same time period as the Nvidia adapters
There are thousands of these being used for the last few weeks and this one case One failure within a few weeks out of only a few thousand devices is pretty damning It'd be one thing if there were millions of units for months and only then they had a few reports of recurring issues but this is brand new tech and we're already hearing about massive problems
It is also very likely but some already tried not connecting it properly and still failed to replicate the issue The weirdest part of all this melting is that we can t find a consistent pattern and it seems to be all over the place thinking face
This is exactly what is happening One dude on FB claims his ATX 3 0 melted yet didn t provide any additional info Seems a bit sketchy to me
Definitely plausible
Thank you face with tears of joy
It's taking more than a week for NVIDIA to come up with a public announcement By now their accountants are runing the numbers on which feasible option they're left with that avoids lawsuits and a hot burn in their pockets
If it results in 2 people instead of 10 getting a burnt connector every day just as an example I'd argue that it matters I personally keep mine capped at 70 power I lose about 5 of my card's potential within the 100 power draw but under load I'm at 320W Until this issue is 100 solved I'll keep at it as my connector is rock solid in this configuration
Well that happens when you opt in for sleek looking power pin over safety with sense pins nobody asked for
Thats not true either because TecLabs ran 1400w through the connector If you don't plug in the connector on the other hand then thats another story
I mentioned that the plastic used in these adapters could be part of the problem when this situation started Plastics have different heat limits and melting points So I totally agree with what you say My original post mysteriously disappeared We live in Strange times rolling on the floor laughingtumbler glass
From what I can tell these connectors are designed and manufactured by Amphenol They are the ones providing both the male and female versions So all connectors will meet the same spec and be using the same plastic I couldn't find any evidence of other vendors of the connector though some Chinese company could be making inferior knock offs and those could be making their ways into adapters and cables Is there any evidence of that
70c is out of spec although some maybe using it 105c is the PCISIG spec for the adaptor

Video card BIOS or VGA bios or VBIOS update is aromatically available through msi Center I actually use manual vbios update procedure using nvflash
well don't know wich card you have but nvidia designed the 4090 for max POWER of 600W which should be considered short term not sustainable however TDP is set 450W for all On top of that vendors have given some freedom to paly with the Power limits depending on their cooling solution quality of die and so on So its not kind of mandatory that all cards have bios which supports the maximum 600W Now some vendors may limit the max power if they find out the card is not performing as supposed or other risks may be involved Now to my case my card was shipped with 600W BIOS I personally saw short term power draw of 618W however due to the idiotic 12HPWR melting situation msi decided to tone down the card a bit in sense of power consumption I still have mostly the same performance the card sits mostly 2940Mhz tuned by nvidia scanner tuner and even if I don't use the tuner the card is always slightly above what it should be and sits at 2880Mhz while the actually should be on the gaming BIOS 2640Mhz Obviously the card will try to preform maximum performance depending on your overall system Now depending on the card you have bios available by the card vendor maybe they don't allow 600W due to the ongoing situation you may find a 600W bios and force flash the card but you may also destroy your card in process which then wont be warranty valid Best source if you want to risk it but don't hate me if something goes wrong manufacturer NVIDIA model RTX 4090 manufacturer NVIDIA model RTX 4090
Just noticed its a Gaming Trio it is rated 450W as normal so far I don't see anyone actually posting a BIOS so you have to wait Dont even know if you have two bios on your board for example my Suprim Liquid X is rated like this Scilence Bios 450W Gaming Bios 480W
what I find interesting is that the pin burns If it was the current was drawn out of spec we would see more burnt CABLES but we always see the point of failure to be the PINS x200B Maybe the adapters are fine and the problem is wih the card's pins themselves burning up all the adapters
XD true story To connect the gpu for pc you will need a car engine and not psu
The issue may be that manufacturing defect are way more prevalent with 12vhpwr because the margin of error are way smaller We need Nvidia or PCI SIG to step up 's really unfair for people who just want to enjoy their 4090 to have to wonder if it will melt wtf
It makes me thing the real issue is people are not plugging their cables all the way in Even if that's the case the fact that this type of issue can occur is really a fault with the connector As JohnnyGuru said you need to make things idiot proof for consumers at large The whole bending thing is another issue like some person out there is going to try and fit a 4090 into an ITX case eventually 't able to be bent don't release it because some idiot will bend it to fit it in their ITX case
In 99 of cases I d take the extra frames from keeping RT off even on an nvidia card
RT adds zero tto none to my gaming experience I'll take better perf wattage and good old power connectors any time though Been running Nvidia cards since 2006 btw They give 0 fks about their customers
At least they won t burn your house
You can look at the CPSC regulations yourself if you want I stipulated that I'm no expert perhaps Nvidia has a way around these regulations The company s investigation to determine whether to report to the CPSC should not exceed 10 working days unless the firm can demonstrate that a longer time is reasonable under the circumstances Absent such circumstances the Commission will presume that at the end of 10 working days the company has received and considered all information that would have been available to it had it undertaken a reasonable expeditious and diligent investigation Just to clarify this is duty to report to the CPSC not duty to report to the consumer but once they report to the CPSC then they need to begin the voluntary recall process which means they can't keep selling the thing Obviously this is complicated by Nvidia being a global company as I'm sure regulations everywhere are different but unless Nvidia can convince regulators that melting cables are not a fire hazard at some point they need to pull product and then silence is no longer an option
Based NVIDIA damage control
2 or 4 gauge speaker wire is not dinky
I do want the best but I don't want to deal a melting connector on a 2000 euro product I'll settle for 2nd or 3rd place peace of mind power efficiency and keep the difference in price That is if the reviews don't show any issues of course Same reason why I didn't buy the samsung neo g8 with all QC issues even though the specs are amazing
The truth And I am NO fan of nvidia But my 4090 is literally game changing in MSFS MW2 and Cyberpunk Don t have a single ounce of buyer s remorse
as it looks currently a 3x8 4x8 to 12 4PIN connection is the best case scenario until we hear more from MSI what happened here could have been just a random defect which can happen to everyone during mass production
Even the 3x8 Nvidia adapter is affected if you are talking about that one
Jon Gerow suspects exactly what you mentioned
send me a DM I will help you out
We are in discussions if we decide to stop selling those then we will make an announcement Want to mention again that this does NOT affect the 3x 4x8 to 16pin cables can t stress this enough
I don't have one so this is just based on images I've found but the MSI native cable DOES look like it's 1 1 cable to terminal
From a purely scientific standpoint that isn't a good sign It points to the problem being more dynamic if they can't reasonably recreate the issue based on the original adapter assumption I'm starting to believe this may be a deeper problem with the cards themselves
This cable doesn't appear to be an adapter it looks native vhpr which is big news
So what about yours do you believe makes them safer So far we've seen multiple different brands burn up whereas you guys are obviously a more niche brand that sells exclusively to aesthetic modders and those on these subs that are panicking over the fire risk It's clear to say your sample size is dramatically smaller and without knowing why this is all happening I think we both know that it's disingenuous to tell your customers that this will solve the hazard with any real certainty With that said would you say right here that yours will without a doubt not burn up like the others
Have you sold 100 000 of them Because that s how many 4090s are out there Can t wait for the post of a custom cable melted Give it time
Don't all of them have this feature It's just that people usually don't like having it on
Yeah but you can disable it
feature
Please post a link to the product on newegg if you see it When I search for MSI MEG Ai1300P then no results are
No I mean it's delisted As in product page removed edit It is now back up
And yet thousands of us are using our 4090s every single day with no issue at all
So far no FE had the problem Only the reference cards design that NVIDIA provided to the third party companies I also think that all cards are not affected otherwise we would see a lot of people reaching this subreddit But i don't think all the melted connectors reported by users was due a bad insertion
From what I can tell most people only find out by chance when they're trying to redo their cabling or whatever The heat generated isn't enough to make the plastics involved burst into flames so most people likely won't notice a problem with the card running but it does hurt any resale reuse value they might have when it's time to upgrade to a new gpu later on
The connector isn t new 3090 Ti has had it this whole time
Hopefully this bend is fine adapter looks fine till now Just checked
Its an FE card
It's still a fact that this is a potential issue that was not present in previous series Sure it's unlikely it will happen to you but you can't guarantee it won't
Thousands of us have the adapter without issues too People are nuts Just plug it in properly and stop worrying about shit
good it will come with a performance cost
Do you think they care They'll do it if they want
Real issue Customers According to Nvidia
AKA bad engineering
I wouldn't be surprised at all Especially those people who didn't even intend to use the included adapter or cable
Won't know till all cards drop and I can make a proper analysis of performance while factoring in what I have and how much I'm willing to spend for said performance bump I am happy with my current setup as I have the ability to play all my games at a minimum 75fps with reasonably decent graphical fidelity temps and noise on a 1440p monitor I may just wait till next gen but who knows Tbh I'm more excited to pick up the Steam Deck and turn it into an emulation machine This gen of gpus is a bit lackluster
I agree just stay put for now and dont buy anything and see how everything unfolds
and you will lose your warranty if use a diferent adapter to the standard that comes with the card
ok good to know Or bad depending on how you want to spin it
So you want to believe less than 10 verified posts on Reddit versus the gurus and testers who ve tried replicating this over and over and over but could not Makes sense The ATX 3 0 PSU standard is completely safe and the native 16 pin to 16 pin 12VHPWR cable is working fantastic for me Not a single issue
I would think that if it was a few bloggers but not every single one Jayz would ve loved nothing more than to have been able to prove himself right with a test And Steve at GN is as transparent as they get It s just extremely weird is what I m saying Something isn t adding up
Ok there goes that shortly lived theory
Is it am i adopted
good spot
Probably getting paid to be a concern troll Someone clearly wants to perpetuate bad PR for Nvidia
Why would someone do that Why would someone do that Have you literally discovered the internet 5 minutes ago
Fear mongering
Was going to say looks nothing like the cable I used same psu helping a friend with his my thermaltake one doesn t look anything like this either
This without cry
I personally do not trust MSI when it comes to PSU MB or GPU It could be a defective
Think of all the people who don't visit the subreddit and had no issues Think of all the people who haven't checked their connectors and will be waiting till the smoke rises Being a fanboi is not cool it never was just saying
why is this video look so low quality
could be holding two ends to two different cables there
Personally I would RMA such card You have no idea what internal damage has caused by the melted connector so it might be possible that even if you plug in a new cable that you'll have some sort of damage on the cards power connector That could lead to damaging the card and as a worst case scenario to a fire
Johnny Guru But I'm 99 9 positive that the graphics card's PCB is more than adequate for the card's power requirements with normal heat dissipation expectations You assign more fault to item two than the article does because you have an opinion that that you want to legitimize The PCB is the flaw is such a silly primary accusation He didn t actually come to the definitive conclusion you lead with Like he says that is a living document and the findings aren t even concluded yet and you just misconstrue his concerns for proven fault
You re right thanks man Also Not the adapter I bought the cablemod MSI kit The 100 one Im Not getting the right angle adapter
Hundreds of us have the adapters and it s perfectly fine as well The sheer amount of panic this issue has created is stupid
I have a Corsair Air 540 case Direct vision of my PSUs distribution panel is just not possible without moving my case and opening the opposing side panel I don't want to have to worry about that connection becoming faulty over time
Plus the PSU side of cases is often so crammed that they need to be bent right after exiting the PSU At this point I think what may be the best would be to replace all the 12VHPWR adapter cables with solid relatively flat adapter that plugs into the 12VPWR of the video card and splits into four female 6 2 pin PCIe connectors With a solid adapter splitter like that there would be no bending and the connection should be solid
12VHPWR 2 0 incoming face with tears of joy I will say though this issue seems largely limited to AIB boards if you look at the reported melting connectors Really hasn t happened with the FE models and they use the same adapters so I have to wonder whether the higher power limits on AIB models are just pushing this connector too far We re probably going to end up with some absurd solution like boards with a 12VHPWR connector plus an 8 pin lol
Exactly this was known like month ago on the leak pictures
Its a surprise because that test was running a synthetic constant 600W load which no real world card should be doing
Anything is possible I don't rule out anything But honestly it seems that this whole new connector brings little difference over multiple regular 8 pins and we should just go back Aside from having a space advantage this new connector is just a total mess for very little gain I would've preferred if NVIDIA allowed partners to just go back to the long PCB designs and three 8 pins on the next generation cards Why try and fix what's not broken The cooler is so large on something like the 4090 anyway so why does the PCB have to be so small on anything but the FE cards
EVGA had an issue with early 30 series PCBs and power load imbalance Not just early ones my hydrocopper 3080 was one of the later batches of LHR cards and it's pretty damned uneven hwinfo said peaks of 140w on 1 160w on 2 and 71w on 3 I checked with a clamp meter out of curiosity and saw pretty much the same thing the 3rd connector is always significantly lower than the others
This might just be an extreme case of that I mean this makes sense given that every single burned pin I've seen in pictures is in the upper right quadrant of the connector
I suspect I am not engineer or electrician but this is possibly due to load spikes
Maybe microsurges that plagued 3090 already Maybe the card is doing its usual 450W most of the time but surges to 750W for a microsecond from time to time
I thought the 4 pins on top of the connector were supposed to change how the power supply communicates with the GPU for power load I think Jayz had a video on it I'm far from an expert on all this so I could be wrong on how it works
People just forget the 3090ti exists do they lol The connector has been field tested even for GPU loads for months as well
There is 0 load balancing its just physics All the 6 pins go over the same shunt resistors so they cant do any load balancing on the card side Btw the 3090ti had 3 shunt resistors so it was able to do some load balancing But 3 shunt resistors and some additional wiring was to expensive for a 1600 card lmao
Well The sole fact that the new 7900XT and 7900XTX have the good old connector and that Intel ARC also have the old connector tells you something about this new standard
100k units sold and maybe a dozen failures Tech reviewers can't replicate the issue Whatever the problem is it is very uncommon and thus hard to diagnose
Higher resistance will lead to higher heat We don t know how the current usage is broken across the pins yet There are 2 or 3 shunts which means at least 2 or 3 current paths If one path is more resistant that has a high likelihood of meaning higher current on the other paths which means higher temps in addition to the heat due to the resistance
if it was the cable the cable would spoof in the middle not at the mating
Like anyone else I really like Jayz and enjoy his content but he s not original and I doubt he fully understands half the topics he talks about That s not a bad thing btw but he should be a little more careful when parroting unsubstantiated content from other creators
Holy shit that might be it The problem is more common with the adapters because the pins are shorted on both sides of the connector The contact resistance is the only thing in the path so variation between pins causes the largest current imbalance For the native cable case the contact resistance is summed with the wire resistance and the contact resistance at the other end independent manufacturing so any one source of path resistance has a smaller relative effect
Not at all we've shipped many of the adapter style and native 16 pin to 16 pin style cables worldwide already with zero reported issues Shouldn't worry at all with our cables
One burnt cable is hardly a statistic but in this context it's looking very likely Yeah no that's not how this works One cable is not a statistic yeah But nothing about these 5 pictures of context means it's very likely to be the standard itself I spent more than a small piece of my career doing electrical power systems failure analysis so off the top of my head I can think of Manufacturing defect of the cable cold solder joint on the pins bridged solder joints solder balls one of the other near countless types of solder defects broken pin retention clips when pins were first installed allowing them to back off during insertion of the connector reducing surface contact increasing heating crushed wires damaged conductor damaged insulation damaged plastic clip housing User error damaged plastic housing usually from insertion failure to completely engage the retention clip of the connector crushed wires again bend radius at the failed connector being too small for designed strain relief Design flaw not enough strain relieve at the connector unlikely pins too small pins too close together pin retention mechanism design flawed connector retention mechanism design flawed I've seen smaller connectors carry high voltages currents simultaneously so I don't think it's necessarily a design flaw of the connection being too small for the amount of power its intended to carry And all this also assumes that the heating occurred originally on the cable and not the GPU this is MSI's quality control we're talking about here Could it be an issue with the standard Maybe But it's not likely imo If it were an issue with the standard itself we should be seeing a lot more melting cables from those who bought ATX3 0 PSUs
BTW I use a smart switch to toggle my computer on and off when I am away so that I can stream Exactly your use case Maybe you should look into that so that you don't have to run the machine 24x7
yep seriously thinking about that specially as I use my PC for work will have to wait until it gets released
On the other hand the old PCIe 8pin connector is so sturdy and build with so many safeguards than even if a connector is not built perfectly it is very difficult to make it fail Yeah and that's why I prefer the true and tried PCIe 8pin connector for now
Remember that the initial PCI SIG memo you know the one which directly led to the recommendations regarding cable bending and disconnecting your cable too many times detailed failures in testing at the PSU end People just wanted a simple explanation and used the absence of any native cable failing as evidence that it's an adapter issue despite absolutely nothing suggesting that might be the case I mean hell I'd wager that barely anyone is using a native cable at this point He's absolutely right in saying that it was not a reasonable thing to say given the circumstances
I welcome the downvotes They only make me stronger lol
Thank you for your support 3 I'm sure they're trying to gather as much info as they can so they can properly address it themselves though
Yikes 300 usd for a psu Thats the price of a midrange gpu Edit lol
In such case you'll be fine If the problem existed it would have appeared already My only advice is to be careful with the cable when you clean up your case
Lucky haven t seen it anywhere in Europe and Newegg doesn t ship here for whatever reason
I doubt MSI even makes the power supplies Virtually every brand just gets their power supplies from well known Chinese Taiwanese manufacturers like Super Flower and Great Wall and then slaps their own brand name on it The only well known brand that I know which actually manufactures their own PSU's is Seasonic
Their newest line is high end tier A on the cultist list and manufactured by the same OEM CWT that manufactures Corsair s highest end PSUs There s nothing wrong with buying one
Why would you say that
I think yours is Ai1000p not ai1300p MSI s official store says it s 360 USD
Where did you buy it
Won't talk until class action lawsuit happens
Yeah idk Just seems a little weird that they includes so many detailed screenshots but not an example of the one thing that could have caused
Exactly my point The Nvidia adapters shipped with aftermarket cards are the ones having these issues But the issue itself is attributed to the pins being shifted by bending the cables near the connector It just seems a little suspicious that this person only omitted a photo of their setup especially since its the only part of the issue that could involve user error Even the cables that have had no issues reported so far have a disclaimer to not bend them within a certain distance of the connector theyre just not meant to handle that But i guess not imedietely hopping on the Nvidia hate train means im defending them and will be downvoted into oblivion thanks reddit
Also who can ensure you that this particular 12vhpwr psu cable wasn't faulty It's not like there aren't faulty cables as a result of trying to minimize manufacturing prices and maximize profits
So you re insinuating that a failure is solely based on whether or not it has a double slit in terms of the connector construction Lol we don t even know the true cause of these failures I m not trying to stir anything From my point of view this thread is trying to stir up more drama not assuage any of it
Yeah but there s been no warning from MSI neither If a buyer is unaware of potential issues when buying from MSI then it s on MSI in the first place not on Nvidia Nvidia will be the ultimate wrongdoer tho
Nvidia has been investigating for 2 weeks with zero feedback
It will likely humiliate the 4080 but if you want 4090 tier performance you are not going to get it especially in RT
What about it looks impressive They didn t show any head to head comparisons
Also in some games having some objects bad rendered or not rendered at all in the distance offers a huge advantage as you will spot enemies much easier That's why my relationship with competitive games is both pure love and hate
I thought he was making some sort of joke
GF3 1650W is possibly the only GF3 model that has 2 12VHPWR outputs so naturally it come with 2 12VHPWR cables I doubt I'll ever need more than one though
MSI GeForce RTX 4090 Gaming Trio X Though I run my card with PL set to 80 for efficiency
Yeah that card just knew where it was and decided it would try to commit die
I LOLED hard at the Waifu case wtf man D
Each loli adds 5 FPS They're more powerful than RGB
I think you mean 1000 year old dragon
Lmao are they dragons in 9 year old bodies If so that is hilarious Truly obscene
My Chinese friends in college could ve written it correctly but I guess it takes an EE Master s degree Also nice comma splice Are you a native mandarin speaker too I m not going to stalk your comment history like you did with theirs to find out
Oh man that's too long to fit in my case with a fan front mounted and might be impossible even without a fan mounted though I'm not sure Definitely wouldn't be my first choice but beggars choosers
They might considering the risks Especially so after we get something from nvidia to confirm it
It won't as long as you follow our guidelines
Interesting that we now gave proof of a native 12pin cable having damage not an adapter It seemed like some places blamed the solder joins in the adapter while they may have been a problem this cable failing probably shows it is a problem with the pins themselves
Based on third party reviews Seasonic and EVGA can match it but there s a performance ceiling for PSUs
What Seasonic def has an ATX 3 0 PSU
And the 4090 having issues was unlikely not impossible
Now should we initiate a recall Take the number of cards in the field A multiply by the probable rate of failure B multiply by the average out of court settlement C A times B times C equals X If X is less than the cost of a recall we don't do one
Naw that is still unacceptable Especially for an issue that could result in houses burned down and charred bodies Any detectable failure rate for something like this isn't okay
Yes and that happens when you opt for sleek looking cards with mini pcbs to try to be more Apple like Literally nobody asked for that as well
Now that you mention I cant find my reply on Johnny Guru's assuming that OP is legit post also He mention that MiniFit was supposed to be rated at 65C but is doing fine so no reason that 70C should melt I posted that MiniFit connectors are mostly built overspec because older generation PCB runs really hot especially the radeon 290s era which the PCB goes beyond 90C Got downvoted bad and now the post seems to be gone edit found it
That's an insanely smart take Never have i once thought about that A lot of electrical components have heat ratings and i have always assumed that would be the least of my worries
I think they should really be checking plastic quality and at what point it starts melting Gotta rule out plastic before going for crazy tinfoil hat theories
wait thats kinda messed up no You and I paid for a product with an expectation only for the manufacture to later shunt the performance regardless of how little x200B Im going to check this after I make a 12VHPWR connector enabled for 600W for my MSI Gaming Trio Im pretty sure power target is locked via vbios so I dont think this will work the way I think it will
Oh first time I heard of this Is this a pretty neccessary hotfix And cant you just use msi afterburner to limit it
If they are like the 12 pins on the 3080FE they can be very very tight to get on If that's the case it would not surprise me if damage is being done seating them
My panel only hits 165H
What games do you play Why would you expect a GPU company to care about you They make GPUs
What GPU burnt your house Do you refer to the 150W cables mistakingly supplied with some 4090s Or are you referring to the historic reports of 8pin cables melting
I love that you're being downvoted for being honest showing your sources and making reasonable assertions Average reddit user IQ is a shoe size I fuckin' swear
t once they report to the CPSC then they need to begin the voluntary recall process which means they can't keep selling the thing Where do you see this The linked FAQ under does a report mean a recall says CPSC staff will evaluate the report and work with the reporting firm to determine if corrective action is appropriate Many of the reports CPSC receives require no corrective action because CPSC staff concludes that the reported product defect does not create a substantial product hazard
Nvidia didn't create the 12VHPWR cable they just are using it since it's the new ATX standard If you're wondering why there's a new standard it's because PSU's that were rated for the correct amount of voltage failed to supply cards like the 3080 properly which caused crashes and other issues The new standard can easily handle spikes SO who do you get mad at No clue we still have absolutely no idea what's causing these cables to fry and are just guessing at this point Instead of pointing fingers let's wait until it's actually discovered Blaming Nvidia for using a new ATX standard makes no sense My guess Faulty PSU's which are sending huge power spikes Same shit happens with the last gen PSU cables
you think we run 4 gauge wire from the amp to the subwoofer ho boy guess what gauge wire they use for 20 amp circuits in a house
I bought a Cablemod 4x8pin to 12VHPWR native PSU cable for my Corsair HX1000 I havent checked to see if its melted Should I stop using it
yes but its not because it is a 3x8 adapter but rather that there might be some manufacturing defects if you believe what the media is writing
ok so the solution is to put dielectric grease on the connectors
I didn t say it was an adapter This PSU is the same as mine ATX 3 0 compliant and mine is totally fine My point was GN has done tons of tests and can t get anything to melt Everyone s quick to a believe anything on Reddit b quick to blame the card or the PSU when in reality this could easily be user error
We've been doing this for over 8 years and in that time we've learned a lot and improved a lot We have a very tedious QC as well which helps with this MULTIPLE checks on the cables from little things like pull tests to make sure they aren't going to pull out to testing and retesting the cables prior to shipping to ensure everything you receive is fully plug and play I wouldn't say it's fair to say our sample size is smaller though we were selling these cables prior to the GPUs even being announced and we have sold and shipped A LOT of these cables already actually And I am 100 confident ours won't burn up if they're handled correctly you can't obviously say they won't 100 burn up with other factors involved For example if a connector isn't fully seated you can get electrical arcing any cable will burn up if you have that happen doesn't matter who makes it and this could be the issue that some people are experiencing already as well there are still a lot of variables and no exact data on what's causing the Nvidia adapters to fail right now we have to wait for conclusive evidence on that I'm sure Nvidia will share their findings on that at some point once they investigate it further and find conclusive data as well though But we have a guide here on how to properly route manage the cables and a support team that's always there to help anyone if they have any questions as well But yes fully confident in our cables I started as a CableMod customer myself 7 years ago prior to getting this job about 6 years ago in fact always been a believer in the quality
Even if a post like that did happen we have a warranty and would cover it Not gonna leave people hanging
My Samsung has the waternark feature too It's just that it's disabled by default
It's back
So I was correct
Maybe there's a bad batch Anyway a fire hazard is very serious and I believe there will have to be some sort of recall
it s more than likely either a few defective gpu s or cables slipped by the processing part and now having the issues I also don t think it s a user error mostly I suppose a few could have not installed it correctly they should have made the cables idiot proof really but still I highly doubt all cases of melting is due to user error and considering they must have sold 10 s of thousands of the gpu s this isn t many that have had an issue Obviously non should have an issue for the price and it s still concerning but nothing is perfect and mistakes are made I have the thermaltake gf3 1200W for my 4090 and gonna wait about a week to install it and use my 3080 while I keep an eye out on news in case any other native brands fail
Yeah what boggles the mind is that it's happening on the 4090 only The 3090Ti with similar power draw on this connector had no issues and the 30 series FE cards using the 12 pin version were also fine
In my opinion you can use the crappiest cable twist it into a friggin knot You still won't have the issue I still believe it's an AIB issue
Yea but better than melting right And for nvidia if they can fix it by just limiting its power then they will do it regardless of what we think But only if it s the actual problem and something else man shrugging light skin tone
They care about investors and not getting sued for fraudulent practices that don't even make sense to do in the first place
Yup recall is a must right now man shrugging light skin tone
What card is it If your monitor refresh rate isn't even higher than 70 Hz it's really a bit silly to spend this kind of money on any of the newest cards for 1440p
Let them try I can't wait to see the community backlash and lawsuits against Nvidia if people start posting denied warranty claims simply because they told them they used a different power adapter in an attempt to keep their card from melting
Have you actually seen them try this over and over again All most of them did was look at the connector through a thermal camera and test it for a limited time Yet people had their adapters bent in all directions up against the side panel playing for 1 2 weeks and not testing constantly for 10 20 hours If you think you re right what s all the fishiness for Who benefits from these posts And besides you only see Reddit posts while 4090s may melt in other countries who don t speak English or use Reddit
So let me get this straight somebody buys a 4090 it melts and despite being an early adopter he now has such a vested interest in fear mongering he attempts to fake that a different cable melted making the problem seem more severe Keep in mind this guy already had a 1500 dollar on boarding cost and had no way to predict his cable would melt to begin with This theory is dumb If you wanted to come up with something more plausible it'd be that he's confused and used the adapter instead of the native cable but thought he did the opposite seems unlikely but doesn't seem as impossible as this
The concern trolls are out in fucking force
Now stop crying
I m not really sure why it s me who s being downvotes it s like you re trying to make fun of people who got stuff from the same manufacturer as you
Idk may be a fb or phone issue At least i can see the entire cable with burnt connector in the video Saying again im not the OP im the repost
If that was true MSI won t make a all new replacement of PSU and card to OP MSI had already prepared both of them waiting for next Monday
One Australian YouTuber said that he had a regular 8 pin connector melt on his card and the connector got some damage too but he cleaned the connector and continued using the card no problem He used a 3000 series for mining
Then you're fine Some user at CableMod is adding speculation to the ATX 3 0 fire but you literally have nothing to worry about yet This isn't verified check the Megathread which verifies as much as possible The ATX 3 0 standard is by far the safest for the 4090
Well 're right I just saw Nvidia published that they've sold over 100 000 4090s in the past 2 weeks and we're talking about 10 or 11 verified users who have had melted adapters Puts things in perspective NVIDIA Has Shipped 100 000 AD102 Ada GPUs For GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card So Far
Great case in all senses
A man of culture I see
Almost seems to be like what the adaptor should have been
Or just not be modular It doesn't make any sense to for all cables to be modular when the 24pin 8pin 12vCPU at least two 8pin 12vPCIe at capacities beyond 600watts cables will ALWAYS be used in 99 of cases Those 1 ers are miners that should have sprung for a mining specific PSU anyway I remember back when modular was first coming out in the 2000's the pros recommended avoiding them for high power applications due to connector resistance and resulting losses This was before TomsHardware sold out to BestOfMedia in 2007 then sold to TechMedia inc in 2013 then again to Future US inc it was ran by enthusiast with actual engineering backgrounds for enthusiasts I remember them doing a whole in depth expos on modular connectors with detailed testing and results that had convinced me I didn't need or want a more expensive modular unit Toms became pretty shitty after they got bought luckily Anand Lal Shimpi of Anandtech filled the gap until they too got bought out by BestOfMedia Now the closest thing I know of is Igors Lab but it's Polish German and not always translated
You're falling into the exact same trap as the native cables are immune crowd There just really aren't a lot of people with FE cards out there It's just a question of numbers pure and simple
I mean by that logic since cables seemingly aren't failing even after throwing 1500W through it any failure should be surprising
I think the real issue is that most 8 pins now can carry way more than the original spec designed and nvidia just wanted something better that let them get 600w without installing 4 8 pin pci e on a pcb which is a significant amount of space on card I think this connector is a bit more flimsy than it should be though I think 8 power 8 ground with sense pins would have been safer and maybe use a bit thicker of a connector That way you are halfing the footprint from what would currently be required but also being overly safe still
The problem is the number of 8 pins needed For 600w you would need 4 of the 8 pin connectors because they are only rated at 150w Technically with heavy gauge wire you can pull 300 through a cable which is why pigtails exist you shouldn't use them if you can avoid it though We do need a replacement long term for the 8 pin connector but the 12 pin one was just not really well designed for that high of a load
Because that lack of PCB is what allows venting out the back of the card Although it seems many AIBs practically block off that vent which seems silly in a card this long that otherwise will block most airflow from the bottom of the case to the top
Because with 4x8 pins your GPU cable is bigger than your motherboards I don't want to wire manage a 32 pin pcie cable
Yeah mine too 3080 ti It never hits 450w only 425w and the 3rd connector is the one that doesn't get maxed out But I always thought it was because the card didn't need to pull that much power and is voltage limited to 1 09v anyway
Yeah this is because EVGA used a trash fire voltage controller IIRC I saw the same behavior on my EVGA FTW3 3080 Ultra LHR
I think a ton of the issue from what I ve seen Folks jamming them in too small of case because they just spent 2k And the work involved in transferring over components Far outweigh the look of jamming the case shield shut pressing that connector hard to a right angle In labs of course they used proper size cases They will instead of coming out with fix that is costly recommend a huge case to house it in Freeing up the wires to come straight out the card vs right angle
Heat generated is V 2 R Voltage will be common if pins are parallel which is the case was per diagram and buildzoid We can clearly see parallel connection on one side That inevitably means higher resistance in one pin sure to bad contact or damage results in less heat generated at that point not more Also there are many photos of 3 4 pins being melted which means one edge pin being broken is just bullshit theory It can't account for everything Fault lying in adapter is clearly not everything because we have a case of non adapter cable burning pins
I would still say starting point is to find melting temperature of that plastic Long shot tinfoil theory is that pcb component is heating up and warming the wire to the point pins break down But it's complete armchair tinfoil theory since I'm not rich enough to buy 4090 much less test it
He really doesn't do scientific testing right He's good at diy cases but not the journalistic stuff
Okay I take you at your word
Agreed even supposedly skilled tech youtubers are acting like dealing with these high currents and voltages is a new thing or that these things don't undergo tons of testing and review before several companies invest millions into designing manufacturing and selling products which implement the standard many of whom would benefit from finding some sort of flaw in the standard It seems very unlikely to be an issue with the standard and very likely some sort of defect or other design flaw anywhere in the pipeline
broken pin retention clips when pins were first installed allowing them to back off during insertion of the connector reducing surface contact increasing heating Having pushed many many molex pins out this is exactly what came to mind
It also looks like an atypical pin burnt which points to mfr defect or user error
Did we have 100s of pictures of burned cables weeks after launch with the 3090 Haven't seen a single one There's something weird going with this generation and the 4090 is simply to power hungry the connector too small That would be my occams razor guess
Yeah no that's not how this works One cable is not a statistic yeah What one is it buddy What are you trying to prove to me here
Well 600w 12v is 50A of current For reference a single wire rated for 50A looks looks like this t know if I trust 12 tiny bits of copper to carry as much current as that thing
Did you actually tried to connect disconnect this connector on a real GPU and then comparing it to the good old 12V connector It feels CHEAP and it's flimsy as hell I know this is not a technical way of analyzing the issue but man the flimsiness is worrisome I always had trouble unhooking the stadard 8 pin cable because it is so sturdy this on the other hand feels like cheap plastic ready to melt This new standard feels cheap and I can guarantee you they will discontinue it
One quality that a standard is supposed to have is robustness in the face of manufacturing defect and user error
That's a bad idea actually since you won't really know the tmstate of the machine when powering down hard you should look into wake on lan instead It will also allow your PC to wake up for updates etc without bothering your work flow
Got one of those as well but if I'm not home when it starts melting and I'm while gaming I have no way of knowing and that scares me
Been using nvidia and intel all my life and this is the first time I may go full amd build too It s not about who s the best but what s safer to use right now
The one that said they imposed zero failures without doing either 30 plug ins or both 30 plug ins AND bending it Right
If it wasn't reasonable to think a vast amount of ppl wouldn't be thinking it We were hoping a better adapter could have solved this This is not unreasonable just because you don't agree To prove my point go online Look at yt videos How many adapter teardowns are there Why would ALL those ppl tear apart the adapters if it wasn't reasonable
I wish a new mid range gpu was 300 You re dreaming lol
1300w with platinum ATX3 0 smart control via computer I thought it isn t really overpriced seasonic PX1300 s price is also around 300 too
That is what I thought Just built a 4090 system for a friend as well using the A1000G with real 16pin cable as well and looked at connector temps while pulling full power and also did not see any issues I still wonder if these issues are coming from defects in the actual connector on the GPU In some of the pictures some pins look recessed short on the gpu side which would cause smaller contact patch or arcing if far enough apart
I had been watching newegg every day One day the PSU showed up on their site but no stock Next day it had add to cart but when I would view the cart it was empty and gave an error Kept checking back and finally got it to go through that was a day or 2 before the 4090 release It went out of stock in no time and I haven't seen it pop back up since Give it some time and they should be become available especially as more brands start releasing theirs
And FSP
A dutch IT online vendor
Yep some times the pins arent seated all the way in the plug too Even the best cables can fail failure rate is never 0 Even seen a cablemod plug that fried on a 3090 and cable mod is one of the best out It happens
No I'm saying that Nvidia adapters all have double slit connectors Hence this is not an Nvidia adapter Of course if you've seen an Nvidia adapter that didn't come with double slit connectors feel free to post the evidence
Two weeks is barely enough time to collect failed samples from users much less replicate the issue and perform root cause failure analysis As I said Don't expect a statement beyond we're investigating until around December
I can assure you that JenSenpai is directly involved in the matter We ll share more once we are ready but atm we don t owe you Sheeple anything
True but with the added benefit of not risking burning your house down
4090 seemed interesting perf wise but I'd be paying 700 extra for slightly better raster and a nice jump in raytracinng perf I don't think raytracing dlss3 is worth 700 extra Not counting the 4080 cause awful price value
Yeah it feels like you're playing in summer and they're playing in winter when you see how much difference there is in foliage based on setting sometimes
This morning I had someone genuinely tell me that 80 series Nvidia cards were always underpriced and should have been 1200 before because I criticised the 600 markup between 3080 and 4080 I can't even tell the jokers from the fanboys anymore
commit die
Welcome to Asia
Hey man no case shaming face with diagonal mouth we all have a design we like and he just happened to like waifu cases lol face with tears of joy
Excellent user name
Your Chinese friends who live in America attending American colleges can write better than a person who lives in China and likely only learned English for online interactions Wow congratulations make sure you tell the Chinese friends that live in your head that I'm proud of them
Just installed the card it clicked and it is completely flush It is the bad one though with two slits Card barely fit my case though because when taking the measurements i somehow ignored a radiator on the backside thinking it would not interfere If the card was two millimeters longer it would not fit D
Their Vertex series It s not even out yet
There are thousands of these being used for the last few weeks and this one case goes viral and this sub and the internet lose their minds over just 1 thing going wrong out of many thousands Let's wait and see for more evidence before we flip tables Apparently it's damning enough for you to delete your comment u nottoshabbie Lmao I have a atx 3 0 psu hooked up to my 4090 not everyone is using the 're freaking out at the thought that 12VHPWR is just as problematic as the adapter cables At least the adapter cables will only fail where you can see them
Every product ever manufactured has a detectable failure rate
Am no expert but some plastics do have very high melting points so I would expect the power these cards a putting out the plastic used on these adapters would be suitable but if it s substandard in any way then the melting point would be reduced dramatically Only a thought Maybe someone with an understanding of plastics and temperatures could give more knowledge on this tumbler glass
Yes but ultimately part of the issue is why the temperatures are getting there in the first place Most plastics have melting points well above 120 C An electrical connection should not be generating temperatures that high it's above the boiling point of water If the plastic is melting its because of heat and if the connection is that hot it's an electrical issue
Well I suppose you could us AFTERBURNER to limit your power however I never did that to under power my VGA the BIOS is just sort of optimization on the power draw I noticed the OC curve is more gentle and over all power draw is less on different power stages and frequencies However before updating backup your original bios be sure you flash the correct bios you have two SCILENT and GAME or similar witch is more aggressive
I refer to this link
Not from that link just remembering from reading about it a different time iirc they have 20 business days to initiate a voluntary recall after they report If it's important to you I can try and track down where I read that
When I see a single 40 series card blow up using the new standard I ll believe it Daisy chaining is known to be bad the fact that NVIDIA pushed this card with a single 12 pin is gonna get them fucked by AMD this gen They haven t released a statement because you can t take the cat out of the bag
I can see that audio wiring is the ONE thing you know about so you go ahead be this particular Reddit threads expert Congratulations thumbs up
voltages matter You will note the 2 000W amp may have smallish speaker wires but the wires providing them 12v are much larger In the case of computer power wires for gpus it is also 12v power being sent and rather than 0 ga cables like the amp they are making up for it with multiple 16ga
no the cable you bought is totally fine 16pin to 3x8 4x8 are totally fine as stated in my post above only 16to16pin cables are in question not because there is something wrong with the cable but with the standard overall potentially
Do you have any information to spare about the plastic used in these adapter is it a nylon compound PA 18
Oh I don't know what to believe I do not believe the spec itself or the connector is flawed but most likely defective parts here My point was that just because this one failed it doesn't mean 3x8pin adapter is safer either They're just as capable as failing
I think you mean manufacturing defects
The solution here seems to be to plug it all the way in The biggest problem we can t account for in all of these melted cable posts is seeing exactly the way the cable is plugged in when it melts because naturally everyone who sees it or experiences melting smells it is going to immediately take the cord out and then we ll never know for sure if it was actually fully inserted
We ve been doing this a while Unlike MSI and ASUS and NVIDIA right
It was delisted when I posted So the attempt at correcting semantics was incorrect but who cares
Melted Plastic Connector Bursting into Flames Yes I know tech tubers keep saying that and it's fine to pressure Nvidia but it's just not what we need to worry about The problem is 1600 cards with permanently damaged connectors is simply inexcusable
In my mind it s an adapter QC issue But we still don t have concrete answers This post is suspect because he s not showing the complete cable or adapter in the photo In the 3rd or 4th pic you can see a bit of the heat shrink that the adapters use on the burnt one The native MSI cable doesn t look like that Edit 4th photo Look in the gap between the two adapters he s holding Lol and the 5th photo That s a burnt adapter not a native cable
3090Ti had 3x 12v power planes connected to the 12vHPWR connector 4090 only has a single 12v plane this could be the issue of uneven current being pulled through particular pins and melting
Yes it has You are misinformed
If they do that they need to offer a full refund program for customers that bought it at a higher power rating That is like buying a 500hp car and having it detuned because the motor blows up at the rated HP level No thx
They did it before and they will do it again Anyone remember EVGA 9XX WTF series cards They just released bios updates with lowered clocks and power limits so the cards would stop black screening This is how they solved out of spec MOSFIT's problems Or the GTX970's and the 3 5GB fiasco Where 0 5GB was not as the advertised specs
They need to determine the actual problem first It's not flaming up or doing anything dangerous it's just melting connectors
Still a moot point until all the cards from all the companies drop If a monitor upgrade is needed then I would obvs pick that up along side a new card I'm highly doubtful anything coming out is really going to make me actually want to upgrade though as I said I'm pretty stable on every game I play on 1440p at a minimum 75fps steady I am curious to see everything but not hungry to buy anything and probs won't be for a few years yet Instead I'll spend the next 2 4 years enjoying an offline emulation machine that is the steam deck along side my normal at home desktop gaming Almost went Aya Neo but the button layout on the Aya Neo line up seems a bit cramped for larger hands
At least the graphic card maker must approve these changes as they know that the adapter suplied with their cards is not so gif giphy qjBzptUFOCeyY
and you could say that the melting connectors story is all completely fabricated by AMD to take the wind out of Nvidia sales for the 7900xtx release Cablemod to sell people replacement safe cables Youtubers for racking up drama view PSU manufacturers to get you to buy new ATX 3 PSU's etc etc Note Post is in jest as I know some of you won't see it that way
Sorry man not buying your reasoning It s very conspiracy based
GN literally showed their methodology and explained every detail of their testing method There s also PLENTY of people who benefit from this Competitors Cable makers etc
I cannot vouch for the other theory but I can kinda confirm the MSI PSU model does not have the fabric sleeving s the anecdotal shot of my cable I don t know All I know is the sleeving point isn t entirely wrong
What do you mean
I'm making fun of early adopters yes People can do whatever they want with their money but this whole fiasco seems like a safety concern to me
that makes this post very questionable
People fake stuff online to get engagement all the time FYI It's probably best to wait for more evidence before believing it
As I said it can work or it can cause some problems I would RMA it
and nvidia just wanted something better that let them get 600w without installing 4 8 pin pci e on a pcb I mean I've said this before there was always the option of running 2x EPS12V which carry 300W each and basically take up the exact same space as 2 8 pins EPS12V inputs are already used on the A6000s
There's a fairly easy solution that already is in use eps cables for cpu power Those are rated for up to 384w per cable Eps cables are already being used in server cards It baffles me that Nvidia wouldn't have just gone with 2x eps for a 600w card Of course it puts more burden on the consumer for the time being but many psus have eps power and pcie 8 pin power interchangeable on the psu side with the cables terminating in their various plugs
Because that lack of PCB is what allows venting out the back of the card Which is basically totally useless on AIB cards which was my whole so you don't need this for partner cards Look at the Suprim and Strix 4090 PCB's They don't have the same PCB as the FE card They should just have 3 or four 8 pins instead of this stupid new connector and just extend the PCB Although it seems many AIBs practically block off that vent which seems silly in a card this long that otherwise will block most airflow from the bottom of the case to the top Well its because they don't need it They designed their cooler differently The FE card has it simply to cool some heatpipes and redirect warm air towards the CPU cooler to exit out of the case t 168 Your argument is that by not having this design most of the airflow for the GPU is blocked and while this is somewhat true it does prevent most of the hot air from the GPU entering your CPU fan s I personally don't see how cooking your CPU is good or a great feature but 's never been a problem But if you really want a similar effect to the FE cards or possibly better because this way the warm air never touches your CPU fan s you could just put a small exhaust fan under the GPU to push the hot air out of your case with an AIB card A small 92mm or 80mm fan will do it just fine as this guy tested There's even 3D print designs out there available on the web to make it easy to mount a fan to the PCIE Slots You'd probably need a case big enough if you're doing this with a 're buying a 4090 you need a big case anyway since the coolers are astronomically large
We're holding it wrong
We re pushing the same current over a more resistive path We aren t limiting the overall current significantly with this resistance Additionally we are concentrating the heat source
Imo we're looking at a few different immature manufacturing processes Not the same process fault for everyone not necessarily just a bunch of companies all dealing with building more of these than they ever had before you could get these adapters for a couple years now through Mod Right and similar but their uses were limited
While dealing with these currents in this size isn't new this is unusual in its expectation around getting the public to plug it in
And if they're building these with robotics I'd be surprised if they are building them all by hand then it might be pretty difficult for them to dial in the insertion process
I've literally seen tens of kilowatts successfully put through smaller cables The trick is making sure there is enough surface area to support the current draw and enough insulation to provide the necessarily isolation for the voltage differentials If there is an issue it's almost certainly a manufacturing process issue we already know how to make cables like these
But how is the 4090 power hungry 99 of the time it s well under 400w at full load while gaming You re acting like it s pulling 600w constantly and it s not
What are you trying to prove to me here That a sample size of 1 is so insignificant that it's irrelevant You can't say something is very likely of a single sample especially not without doing any kind of root cause determination It sounds like MSI actually took an interest though and is exchanging the PSU for OP so I am betting that they're going to dissect the whole cable to figure out what happened But in my experience failures like these 99 times out of 100 it's a manufacturing defect either from poor processes or a bad batch of material from a vendor not a design flaw
They said that's not how this works so they meant no Is English your second language buddy
600w is the cumulative total wattage Not the wattage of every single line in the new connector So for the 12VHPWR connector pins 1 6 are 12V connections and 7 12 are their returns Pins 1 6 are the supply bus and 7 12 are the return buss The voltage differentials between pins 1 6 should be 0V and the voltage differentials between any pin 1 6 and any pin 7 13 should be 12V So stick a volt meter on pins 2 and 4 and you read 0V Stick the volt meter on 2 and 8 and you read 12V This is because the 12V on pins 1 6 are all coming from the same power rail and it's returning to the same power rail via pins 7 12 Now as for power that 600W for 12V does work out for 50A you're correct on that But you're neglecting that that 50A is spread out over 6 conductors the supply bus pins 1 6 So it's really 8 3A per line which let's be generous and label them critical 3 voltage drop is the max allowed over a 6 foot run means you're using 16AWG wire What you showed presumably was 6AWG and would only be appropriate if you were trying to pump all 50A through the same conductor which they aren't Take a look at a comparison between AWG sizes here Now what is probably happening is that 1 or more of the pins is not inserting all the way This decreases the surface area of the connector and essentially shunts more amperage over to the other 5 lines of its respective bus Now exactly why this is happening is really anyone's guess but I maintain that it's probably a manufacturing defect not a design flaw for all cases
Well first off the quality of the connector is entirely up to the vendor Not even necessarily MSI ASUS Gigabyte vendor but whomever they buy their adapters from It has nothing to do with the standard Second it's a low cycle connector you can get away with cheap because it should only see a couple dozen insert remove cycles over the course of its entire useful life Finally they definitely aren't going to discontinue this standard Standards in this case are basically a written document that basically says which pins will have which voltages and signals what the mechanical tolerances will be and what their keying for each pin will be to ensure that only one connector will fit in its matching receiver and vice versa A higher power connector with feedback to the PSU has been a long time coming to the ATX standard They aren't going to get rid of it The most I can see them doing is releasing a revision to the overall ATX3 0 standard to codify material properties of the plastic shells around the pins And even then they may not do that if the issue is entirely the result of poor manufacturing processes
Standard does not equal manufacturing process To use an analogy the IEEE wifi standards don't specify how a Wi Fi module or router should be made only what frequencies powers channels and similar specs they must have in order to qualify as meeting the standard And no build quality is not one of those specs It's up to the manufacturers to figure out how meet a standard For the 12VHPWR connector in the ATX3 0 standard pretty much only the pin arrangement and physical dimensions tolerances are specified No mention of materials finishes weights or even MTBF All that is left to the manufacturers to figure out on their own as they see fit for their particular business model
Why will I power down hard I shut it down from windows before waiting for 2 minutes to turn the switch off remotely
Good you realize where all these 35mm no bend recommendations are coming from Fact is the failures are happening whether you like it or not
We were hoping a better adapter could have solved this This is not unreasonable just because you don't agree It's unreasonable because nothing in the initial PCI SIG memo which brought this entire problem into the limelight to begin with indicated that it was an adapter problem or something limited to specific types of cables If that memo wasn't leaked we'd just be brushing off these failed cables as mere manufacturing defects and not being worthy of our attention How many adapter teardowns are there Why would ALL those ppl tear apart the adapters if it wasn't reasonable Because they're bandwagoning on Igor's article and practically no one has native 12VHPWR cables anyway
There are some good options in that price bracket like the RX 6600 XT which is now seen for under 300 sr 1 3 crid 28R24VTTU8MJL keywords rx 6600 xt qid 1667568761 qu eyJxc2MiOiI1LjA5IiwicXNhIjoiNC4yNCIsInFzcCI6IjMuODYifQ 3D 3D sprefix rx 6600 xt 2Caps 2C136 sr 8 3 ufe app do 3A And with how well it runs games t 192 I would consider it mid range I can understand how the past couple of years made that seem impossible until now though lol
I ve seen 3070s in the 350 range lately
You know that AMD exists right
No he's not Have you done a Google search of midrange cards today Also to be clear when we say midrange a 3070 is not mid range
Rx6600 goes as low as 200
Yeah it s the PSU I wanted because of the usb connection for telemetry You can t get it here yet though in the US so I got the tier down 1000w version Still has the new connector Sadly it s probably this exact one you have But is going to drive a 3090ti FE so maybe a little less risk Maybe
I was thinking just the same If that's the case we didn't see many issues arise with native cables from either an ATX 2 0 or ATX 3 0 PSU simply because not enough have been available to people with 4090s on their rig I placed an order for the Ai1300p so hopefully my card is fine no matter what I throw at it Based on a review I saw this PSU is supposed to be excellent managing to reach Titanium efficiency at a certain wattage as well as passing on all ATX 3 0 tests without a sweat
That will be totally different series with the Ai1300p At least the 80Plus certificate isn t same means different production line
That was an old post if you're referring to the one I'm thinking of cause of that was unknown but we have a great warranty and support team so we always will take care of any issues like that We ship loads of cables worldwide you don't have to worry with us
Yeah no shit Sherlock I understand perfectly You clearly are having difficulty comprehending what I even said in the comment above
People reproduce the problem within a week or two While I agree that something might take a while but now we re dealing with a failing pc part that will keep failing until the official statement And Nvidia didn t have the courtesy to advise against using the cards at least
You could put the difference into other bits of hardware you've been neglecting like the CPU the 4090 will absolutely bottleneck
They'll unlaunch the 4080 again before doing a price drop
Who the fuck cares about RT It barely makes any difference if it makes a difference at all
AMD is a company and companies like money If it was 4090 performance it would be closer to 4090 price
Even just based on AMD's marketing graphs with their 1 7x etc vague performance improvement numbers it would not match a 4090 in rasterization and definitely not in RT 7900XTX vs 4080 might be interesting especially since AMD still has a big price advantage over the 4080 1199 MSRP
git commit die
What in the fuck is a headmate Also who said I went to college in America You should still fix your comma splice but I bet you don t know where it is
Huh interesting I guess my microcenter was selling them early cuz they were def selling Seasonic ATX 3 0 PSUs on the release of the 4090 They also were selling the TT PSU at that time too
But not all failures are created equal DoA is a much different situation than fire
Or you end up with plastic and cable within spec but at the far end of spec causing the but again on the low end of what is acceptable as far as melting points Combine a low end spec cable low end spec plastic and you get to be an unlucky owner that end up on these posts If you have any other cable or plastic across the spectrum you'll be fine but low low quality and you could face the melting No idea just speculating
Just asking to verify the plastic quality here It's typical to check all assumption when finding problem I'm not saying plastic is definitely the issue or it can be the only issue I'm just saying it's a potential issue that should be checked
And that burnt his house I beleive 8pin melted inside gpu is there an easy way started the great fire of L
It's not important but I am curious Don't put any effort into it
Can't speak to their knowledge of audio wiring but for reference here is an image used for car amplifier wiring sizes based on length and amps 12 is what your gpu is getting The 4090 being a 450w card at 12v it should be about 37 5 amps of draw With that being the case if it were a car amp I would go with 10 gauge wire for a 4 foot run
Thanks Good to hear
What about the adapters though I mean the ones you are selling im about to order a 3x8pin to 16pin adapter should I stop Any plans for making cables for bequiet Seems like you only have for corsair asus seasonic
Which adapter
Thanks for the help
I wonder how bad is the smell of the burned connector I mean could one not notice it A few days after I bought my 4090 and ran some benchmarks I smelled something very faint but I checked the connector and it's still 100 ok It must have been the bouquet of everything else on the card which starts to develop only above 50 C or so funny enough I never noticed that on my 3090 which was at least 10 C hotter than the 4090
Delisted implies taken down because of some massive hazard or the product is bad 't seen a single piece of evidence to show that That's all Wasn't trying to bust your balls but I think there's some unnecessary hysteria going on w the 4090 Nvidia just published they've solved over 100 000 4090s so far and we've seen maybe 8 to 10 people with melted adapters
I have the Ai1300P too but no 4090 to plug into face with tears of joy The tape wrap on the burnt connector does look like mine though Close up of cable PSU end looks like heatshrink due to image quality but it's like the first pic
Well AIBs have always pulled shady crap that but that's a seperate issue Yes both Nvidia and AMD have marketed products incorrectly and it has led to lawsuits Nvidia doing what you're proposing would be beyond anything they've done before Trust me if I thought it was even a viable solution I'd agree with you but it's not
Well yeah that's pretty much what I'm saying If you're happy with your setup then save your money Otherwise getting one of these monster cards without a new monitor would mostly be for the future in which case there's no point in spending top dollar at launch The amount of money you save later could pay for much of the monitor It's amazing to me how many people who can't even take full advantage of it went and spent 1600 on a 4090 Jensen knows how to sell graphics cards I'll give him that
They just aren't going to do anything The adapter is in there for legal protection in case someone does something really stupid but they aren't going to actively look to use that an excuse to deny warranties Not defending Nvidia but for a company that big it's simply not worth even more bad press to try to save a few bucks and I'm not sure it'd even hold up in court since the connector isn't their IP to begin with
As a joke or not I still don t know how these ill willers managed to melt adapters being located in Spain in the US in China and in South Korea while testers on YouTube absolutely couldn t make theirs melt
If you don t buy my reasoning then sell me confidence that this won t happen to my card and we ll call it a day
I don t know dude all I want is to use the GPU as intended and I m on my bundled adapter until I get a Gigabyte PSU yeah I know no alternatives here yet with a native cable By now I ve seen no damage on the adapter and I d love it to stay that way but the point is I m anxious due to these posts and regardless of whether it s an intended attack against Nvidia or not I m nervous And by the way then how do these competitors succeed in melting their cables when testers don t Do they put paper into their connectors Use lighters to melt the adapters
Hi I just received today my new PSU MSI A1000G and my cable has the fabris sleeving and cables are thinner than yours as u jenesuispasbavard has said So yes MSI uses different cables Mine looks exactly the same as the Op's the melted one My PSU wil return to the shop BTW No issues with the adapter with my 4090 I just wanted peace of mind with a direct 12vhpwr cable ATX 3 0 psu but now everything has gone to the hell x200B x200B width 3024 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 3673c974fdcd0e266887b708a0d71c9b5812c3c4
Interesting it may be that MSI is sourcing multiple suppliers for the cables Which MSI PSU is yours I'm using the Ai1300P and mine is like a fabric tape instead
Occam's razor he got a different cable than you got I'm not entirely opposed to the idea that he mixed the cables up somehow but the conspiracy theory seems dicey as hell I mean OP could solve this get a picture of the cable because apparently there are doubters
Now stop crying
The concern that should have not existed
I don t think so If there s any doubt about cable MSI won t contact OP really quick and talk to him about replacing with all new GPU and PSU
Now there s the evidence fs e s TIeQ9V
Ok fair enough
Nvidia has been using eps12v for certain professional cards since at least the 900 series with the Tesla M40
I have to feel like there is a reason why thos obvious solution was not used I mean it could have been used a decade or whenever lomg ago thet switched to two 150W Anyway it's possible there is a good reason why you can't use the CPU EPS as lower delivery for PCIE I know that the internals of the PSU GPU power delivery system is complex
I had an older PSU that was EPS but lacked a PCIe connector for a GPU I found an EPS to PCIe adapter cable and used that to power the GPU until I upgraded the PSU
FE cards actually vent mostly out of the IO panel unlike AIBs which hardly push anything out that way due to the heatsink fins being completely vertical So the AIBs cook the CPU more than the FE as almost all their heat is into the case As for larger PCBs that costs more money The only logical answer here is this was a money saving exercise
Yes Regards u Totally Not Jensen
Needs e atx sized case to prevent strain on wire
We are not pushing the same current over both paths All the paths are in parallel so the current prefers the path of least resistance
That's not how parallel connections work A bad contact pin would be the last to burn
All you did is reword what I said And I said very likely NOT because it was one cable I said likely because that cable burnt that same was as the adapters so that's sus is it not So Edit grammar spelling
Do YOU know how to read buddy They said no followed by yeah or did you miss that part my dude If you gonna jump into an argument know wtf you even talking about
They should really be using Ultem for the adapter You need at least 2 5 elongation at break for a rigid plastic latch this small but also high heat performance and achieve sub micron tolerance conformance on the pin shells
Look up design for manufacturing A standard that requires unusual attention to build quality is a bad standard
It could be doing an update post shutdown or got stuck on something so on
Yeah but I also realize that thing doesn't prove any of what's happening right now Somehow you don't
So you know more then all them Plus that only proves my point If it was unreasonable then there would be NO bandwagon
Yeah I do I think they make a great product as well Just don t know about their American pricing so didn t want to comment on them
3050 3060 3070 3080 3090 Not trying to be an arsehole here But which one of these is middle of the range Either way this gen was over produced and being replaced by a new gen So prices are coming down Don t expect 300 midrange next gen either Fucking 4080 is 1200 Seriously WTF
I m not the OP XD If there s be a cable problem I think it ll also occurs on the same connector whether the lower power consumption or not
I wouldn t worry much about the 3090 FE I ve had mine installed for over a year with the included adapter and have had no issues
but we have a great warranty and support team so we always will take care of any issues like that Excellent because failure rates are never zero
Almost but not quite I'm having difficulty comprehending why your reply was completely irrelevant to my initial comment But I suppose it's actually not that difficult to comprehend if we make certain assumptions about your intent and character
Very funny how you accidentally imply that Nvidia merely making an official statement will stop all the part failures
Mate I'm not writing a book Comma splices are not necessary and most professors will dock points for using them English majors are so fucking cringe

Well good thing none of these have caught on fire
If a firm reports a potential product defect and within 20 working days of the filing of the report implements with CPSC a consumer level voluntary recall that is satisfactory to the staff the staff will not make a preliminary determination that the product contains a defect which creates a substantial product hazard Pretty sure I read that somewhere else initially but this is from the CPSC recall handbook I had a hard time finding a quote that you have to stop selling the thing when you submit a voluntary recall plan but it's sort of common sense that the first step is to stop selling the thing since the whole plan you're submitting is about how to remove the defective product from the market All of this is contingent on the CPSC determining that the product does constitute a hazard if Nvidia wants to argue with them on that I believe the issue falls under a class B hazard Exists when a risk of death or grievous injury or illness is not likely to occur but is possible or when serious injury or illness is likely or moderate injury or illness is very likely The issue isn't likely to kill somebody but it could if it burned their house down and the product is not one where the danger of fire is considered acceptable or just part of the product the example they give is that a kitchen knife is dangerous but it's not defective Now could you drag your feet for an additional 20 business days putting together a recall plan and not actually taking steps to stop selling the product or communicate the problem to consumers Maybe I'm not sure that's a question for a lawyer who specializes in this stuff it certainly doesn't seem to be the intent of the regulations to enable that but it might be a loophole
As I have stated the adapter cables are totally fine and no issue there there might be also all fine with the native 16to16 ones but we just don t want to risk anything We offer cables for be quiet via our Configurator Let me know if you need help
your own
I noticed same thing on 4090 Connectors fine performance fine I figured some stuff from factory burned off when it was fired up Which card do you have
Nvidia isn't paying you my guy they're a commercial company not a sports team
Around 20 and 1 native today but remember not everyone use Reddit to announce things so the numbers could probably a lot bigger and people just went straight for RMA or return
Interesting Could still just be a defect in that particular cable
You mean like this link which clearly states that the power connector is the same And that it also uses an adapter
me neither It's like the double slit experiment only with melting connectors They only melt when not being watched by youtubers
Nobody can do that and to say otherwise is bullshitting u cuz regardless of what people say here u are fine until ur not and for all we know u or me could be the next victim of this and people will still call it user error which is honestly not a thing anymore cuz multiple people already tried doing user error and failed to replicate the issue

I have the 1000w Ai1000G on the box in the second picture They seem to be sourcing different cables for their stuff yeah Either that or the 1300s do have sleeving but I think there is another reply in this thread pointing to the contrary as well so woman shrugging light skin tone
Is this an internet meme
It just doesn t make sense No specs nothing about if he didn t connect it correctly did he hear a snap what were his settings when this happened etc A Facebook video from 1 person has caused all this hysteria from ATX 3 0 I just don t buy it Everyone needs to breathe This has caused a ton of confusion as 99 9999 of the burned issues were with the adapter
That's more like it
MSI Gaming trio and yet still no Founders cards Burnt evidence
There's a pretty obvious reason why Nvidia didn't go with it they wanted a single connector solution and figured they might as well reuse that 12 pin they made for the 30 series and repurpose it as the new power plug standard for atx 3 0 before someone goes in and says oh it's Intel's fault that the 12VHPWR connector exists they're the one who makes the standards I'm almost certain it was Nvidia that proposed this connector to PCI SIG with both AMD and Intel going along with it as it was Nvidia's proprietary connector before being standardized 2x eps would take up a similar footprint as 2x pcie 8 pin from previous generations but Nvidia wanted a single connector solution could be for a few reasons space savings on pcb single connector looks nicer etc Was it a good idea to shove 600w through a connector where the previous version was rated for 450w Only time will tell I suppose
Given the problem is the width of the case and AFAIK there is no standard that dictates that its not that simple Almost all cases don't have enough clearance to the side panel as they'd need to support 180mm tower coolers to really be wide enough and 160mm is the norm for bigger cases from what I've seen It boggled my mind why NVIDIA didn't keep the angled connector as it seems essential for the taller AIB cards Its telling I haven't seen an FE card with the problem yet although that could merely be that there are barely any of those in the wild
It s not the same It s close Current flows via paths proportional to their resistance not to the path of least resistance
I don t follow what you re saying at all
You literally wrote in an earlier post that one cable isn't a statistic but it's looking very likely I would consider that an 's not a statistic but it is lol
All you did is reword what I said No you said it's not statistically significant but also very likely Those are conflicting statements I said likely because that cable burnt that same was as the adapters so that's sus is it not And you can't say that just because the end result is the same that so is the root cause That's not how any kind of failure analysis works So no it's not sus not with the implication that they are related to one another in a technical sense
q no yeah no video oq no yea no aqs chrome 3 69i57j69i60j0i10i512l5j46i10i512j0i10i512j0i10i22i30 3309j0j7 Language is not so simple my friend
Probably I haven't dug into which plastics are being used in this scenario but I would not be surprised if the solution isn't a switch to a better shell material That might make the assembly process easier more reliable
Yes I'm aware of design for manufacturing my MS thesis is on automated manufacturing processes Design for manufacturing is a design philosophy not a design standard I think you're confusing the two right now A design philosophy is how you approach a problem when trying to solve it A standard is a list of specifications that a product must meet in order to qualify for a standard You use a design philosophy when creating a product to meet your desired required standards I've been repeating this ad nauseum in all my replies at this point but what we're most likely seeing are a few different and independent manufacturing processes that are still pretty immature leading to lower MTBFs Not an overall failure to design for anything just hiccups as manufacturers figure out how to work with one of the first new connectors introduced to the ATX standard since the 24 pin connector was introduced to replace the 20 pin
I mean it tells me when it has an update Plus why will it be stuck shutting down Never heard about it
Clearly it's scary enough that Cablemod was the one that first publicly introduced the 35mm no bend recommendation despite having what is clearly vastly superior build quality Clearly they're cautious about something you're choosing to pretend is a non issue Is that memo definitive proof of what's happening now Obviously not But it's certainly what even brought this issue into the limelight to begin with since without which we'd just be casually dismissing these failures as statistical anomalies It's not something that should be just written off as unfounded bullshit as you seem to want to make it out to be
If it was unreasonable then there would be NO bandwagon Man you must be new to the techtuber industry The POSCAP saga isn't exactly ancient history
Rx 6700xts new go for as low as 360 Nvidia is just a joke in that segment
Yeah but you've also got all of the Ti series for 30 generation right 3060 is a solid card and it's 350 right now
It s a ti but I actually plan to not use the adapter since the PSU has the 16 pin connector Unless that s actively more risky It s a lot less peak power than the 4090 though Even the 3090 ti
I didn t imply that what will stop these cases after the statement is the instruction what to do with it return the card change an adaptor or update a driver vbios that will limit power draw Doesn t matter a clear instruction from the vendor would be better than endless theorizing and failing tech
I m struggling to find your point here It seems like you are agreeing with me and saying comma splices are bad In any case it would ve taken less time to fix it than type that out but I don t expect much from someone defending poor grammar corrected to please some butthurt people who don t know the difference between a typo and a grammatical error
Thanks
And yet a week ago CableMod was saying the adapter was the issue Lmao
Okay you said cables so I was confused So when you say 3x8 4x8pin to 16pin cables are fine you meant both the adapters and the cables that plug straight to the PSU
I need one for a corsair 1000w psu can you help me
Send me a DM and I will check with the PM team for you
They sure are not paying me which should mean something if I m defending it
LOTTERY CONTINUES THEN
Now stop crying
Whatever settings he used is not relevant and there's no way to know if it was latched regardless what they think they did There's little tolerance between not seating it all the way and refusing to run so that's less likely than people think Even so on a connector this sensitive to damage that alone would be a design flaw One important thing to note is this is a single sleeved cable with thick wrapping fairly close to the connector This would be more prone to causing uneven pressure on the terminals especially on the sides than one with individual cables able to bend easier on their own
It s not the same It s close Precisely because the pins are shorted together it's only as close as the contact resistances Current flows via paths proportional to their resistance not to the path of least resistance I know that I used the cliche wording to try to light up the path in your brain that might help you realize what quick20minadventure was getting at
It's basic physics Voltage difference across parallel connection remains same And energy dissipation equals to V 2 R So if one of the pins has loose contact and as such high resistance R that pin will have the least amount of heat generated
Dude y'all literally nit picking Do I really need to spell out what I meant It's not a statistic But it is also related to what's going on Therefore there is a higher likelihood than there would normally because of the common fault If it was just one burnt cable on its own with no adapters we wouldn't even be talking about this
I'm NOT saying that actually I was very careful to not say that It is suspicious how can it not be Both are now burning Not sus at all Maybe read what I wrote very carefully because your response here and what you're trying to prove to me doesn't make any sense I specifically said we have no way of knowing 100 Look man adapters have been burning so people have been buying third party cables and now third party cables and native cables are burning If you think there is no possibility of correlation there good for you cuz that's not how failure analysis works Personally I have no way of knowing anything for 100 as I already stated but since they are both burning I am willing to bet there is a common cause I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE and NEITHER DO YOU
Don't need to look at that You're adding absolutely nothing valuable to this
I don't think it's a non issue But I DO think posting about pci sig in every thread like you're doing when it isn't supporting what is actually happening is
Adding the Ti models makes your argument worse Would make mid range 3080 Also you just said 3060 is about 350 Still not 300
I d personally use the PSU rather than the adapter Direct line with less points of potential failure
but now we re dealing with a failing pc part that will keep failing until the official statement I didn't think that's what you meant but you absolutely did lol Regardless there's not much reason to whine about having no clear instruction from the vendor because they probably don't understand what's happening any better than we do right now It's Occam's Razor here there's basically no benefit to holding off on putting out a statement unless they don't have any real info to give yet Putting out a statement that ends up being wrong would be worse than no statement at all
I struggling to find your point here Muphry's law at it's finest Should probably pay attention to what you write before you make fun of other people's grammar online
what statement are you referring to
Correct to summarize 3 4x8 to 16pin are not affected by this we are just discussing to see if we stop selling the 16to16pin cables till it was announced what causes the issue in this case here
Holy shit you re fucking stupid The power connector is literally the same There is literally no difference for 3090 Ti vs 4090 in terms of the 12vhpwr connection You can use an aftermarket cable for 4090 and you can use one for a 3090 Ti It makes no difference
I am not disagreeing with you that it's becoming a major problem PR 'm still holding onto the belief that out of 100 000 sales of the 4090 we have less than 0 00015 users having this issue
If we have a simple load the difference would be about 1 5A per pin which while high may be manageable I don t believe that s what we have If the 12V rail is partitioned as it has previously been and divided 3 ways we could have a 7A pin shoot to nearly 14A It s unlikely we have equal loads on vCore vs vMem vs vMisc As such the split and jump is likely different but the magnitude of the jump is going to be higher than 20 33 100 depending on which pin and the vCore vMem vMisc split
We aren t dealing with mythical Zero resistance paths nor are we dealing with identical loads on each pin at the other end The path for current to flow is restricting It creates a heat source in the path I feel like this is a disconnect from classroom examples to real world practice We re not seeing the same system
I specifically said we have no way of knowing 100 While implying that we can 'safely assume' Which we can't The simple fact is we're likely looking at multiple independent root causes that most likely stem from immature manufacturing processes rather than from a flawed design I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE and NEITHER DO YOU I spent 6 years dealing with failed and returned power supplies with my sole duty being figuring out what went wrong how to fix it if it could be fixed and how to prevent it from happening again and more than a few of these had burned up to a crisp like literally filled with black soot holes burned through PCBs melted cables etc And at the same time have been working on a MS degree in robotic manufacturing processes But sure what do I know about power supply failures and manufacturing processes Obviously about the same as you
Take a fucking chill pill my dude
Yea no I get it it's all good have a nice day
when it isn't supporting what is actually happening It's looking like the better supported explanation compared to all the other theories thus far if you haven't already realized
So far the best theories I've seen is likely cable defects However I will say maybe the spec is more succeptible to minor defects and they need better qc That would be a fail
I agree with your last bit and it makes it ever so more mind boggling how it hadn t come up prior to release
Thank you last question found the configurator is there any difference between a 3x8 adapter and a full cable in terms of safety Im contemplating which one to go for
I'm sure it's a small percentage but keep in mind there are surely people who would either never check or simply not post it online Considering this was a notable concern even when PCI SIG was first testing it I don't think it's quite that rare Plus 3rd party cable makers like Moddiy and Cablemod haven't even been able to keep up with demand lately so there's likely a lot more people who just avoided it entirely Not to mention that 100 000 number is just the number of chips supposedly produced already Most of which were sold to AIBs OEMs The majority will become manufactured cards eventually but that does not mean there's already that many in people's hands

probably the worst I have seen
Last night I smelled something while playing the new modern warfare and just thought it was my roommate making something
Nvidia need to say something about this asap It s only a matter of time before there is a serious incident I find it incredible that they have not said a single thing about it yet
That s one of the worst I ve seen so far Let us know if NVIDIA contacts you and more importantly are asking you to sign an NDA Because a lot of the other guys who had burned cards just disappeared
Just got done talking to nvidia they pushed all the blame onto gigabyte even though the adapter has their logo on it which I mentioned they said it was manufactured by third party s and they were only providing the chips and told me to contact gigabyte for everything pushing off their responsibilities
Your cabinet was opened or you can smell them burn even after your cabinet is closed Also which model is it
I thought about upgrading to a 4080 or 4090 from my current 3080 with the intention of switching from 1440p to 4k High refresh rate of course I'm glad I decided to sit this gen out and get a 4k monitor with the next gen This power connector drama is too much for me So many failures in the first weeks Even with native atx 3 0 psus I would have this issue in the back of my head till it happens or the problem gets fixed with new power connectors I already see this standard failing I mean even native psus fail If it's a design flaw too loose tolerances or whatever I guess a few AIBs will go back to 8 Pins
I don't have a 4090 let alone a melted one but I've been following this one with interest and I'm somewhat offended on behalf of owners Nvidia is waiting a really long time to acknowledge the issue and worse they're still selling these with no fix I've assumed they've basically reported themselves to the relevant agencies but the total communication blackout is getting quite old Here is the website for reporting a product to the American consumer protection agency I'm not eligible to report because I don't have one of the defective ones but I'd encourage somebody with a melted 4090 to report because I'm losing faith Nvidia is going to do the right thing here and it is possible nobody has actually submitted this product as a hazard yet
Jesus this is bad Was this from a 150 or 300v cable Send this back for rma
F Sorry dude Good thing you caught it but it sounds like your GPU is now unusable I have a bad feeling this issue is going to cause a recall on the cards and Nvidia is delaying saying anything because only C suite guys can make that kind of call Probably Jensen himself will have the final say And then they have to get all the infrastructure in place to receive the recalled cards do a redesign to make the cards safe and send people new cards out What a huge fuckup
Which Gigabyte is this Also how many pin adapters 4x 8 pin or 3x 8 pin Thanks
1 Buy a 4090 2 Let it burn down your home 3 Sue 4 Massive profit
in an effort to help better determine the problem as a minimum you should be sharing what PSU are you running
I really don t want to go through all this bs I m returning my 4090 today today is the deadline for return I think I m good with my 3080 for another couple years or so
Send it to Gamers Nexus We need forensics
Will the RTX 4080 also have this 12 pin connection issue
Omg
We must have all the power in one tiny connector What a disaster
What resolution in MW2 and how much power draw during gameplay
Oh boy cant wait for mine to do the same
Get yourself the cablemod 12vhpw cable instead
Do we now understand the reason for this If ATX 3 0 PSUs don't prevent this is something wrong with the pin besides the bending
This is just too much and nvidia can't ignore this and keep silent this is potential life threatening hazard and must be addressed before someone get hurt I inspected mine on msi 4090 Suprim Liquid X and it is good however all this reports form users effected buy this unfortunate situation makes me unnecessary worries and I don't see at this point what did I pay for premium price For potential PREMIUM fire
shouldn't anyone with one of these report to their countries equivalent of UK trading standards to get government bodies involved in a safety recall ie What to do if you are concerned about the safety of a product or Check what you should report to Trading Standards You should report a business to Trading Standards if they sold you something unsafe or dangerous like an electronic appliance with faulty wiring or food past its use by date fake not as described for example you bought a package holiday but something advertised wasn t included you didn t want to buy for example they put pressure on you USA text To 20report 20an 20unsafe 20consumer the 20hearing 20and 20speech 20impaired text To 20report 20an 20unsafe 20consumer the 20hearing 20and 20speech 20impaired To report an unsafe consumer product to CPSC online visit www SaferP or call CPSC s toll free Hotline at 800 638 2772 or 301 595 7054 for the hearing and speech impaired
The amount of people here defending a corporating is absolutely wild i hope that boot tastes good at least
I m just glad I paid for a protection plan
the worst I have seen
This is really getting worse and worse
The burning connector isn't the problem its the companies denial of the issue that is
Geez that is painful to see shame on Nvidia
With the scale of this problem I'm waiting for a class action lawsuit at this point Nvidia not saying anything or quickly employing a resolution is baffling
Oh No Nvidia really needs to find a solution to this especially if it burned the card as well I hear cable mod has better connectors which might become essential if this keeps up
Wow flushed face it just keeps happening another one
I honestly think this stupid adapter was and is the worst thing in a long time in pc tech Stupidly placed where it has to bend cheaply made and overall just stupid Another case of it ain't broken so let's break it Nothing wrong with the 8 pins and they are durable AMD didn't offer up anything earth shattering like the 4090 but I like the fact they kept the power down
Daily Dose
Send it to gamers nexus they have requested cables and even offered buying the entire card Testing Burning NVIDIA 12VHPWR Adapter Cable Theories RTX 4090 t 1659
Yes this is a known issue
Use MSI Afterburner if you don t want this to happen again
Got done talking to gigabyte for the RMA and it was surprisingly smooth and easy and now all I have to do is ship it to them and wait for a response about a replacement
Make sure you file a complaint with your Country's health or safety organization It can result in a forced recall
nvidia is selling us cheap shit at a unreasonable high price Dont buy 4090 dont support these fraud mafias
gif giphy qgri3D9sTwCUGMcT8L Seriously though that fucking sucks and I m sorry to see that They need to figure out what s going on
This has to be impacting sales
I don't give a shit what these YouTube people are saying Something has got to give eventually Or a lawsuit will end up happening probably what needs to happen for the money gouging cheap material to be fixed
I really really regret getting rid of my x570 build and 6900 xt now I m stuck with this 4090 Fortunately I ve got cables from moddiy and cm on their way
I'll stay with my gtx 1070 for a while longer
RMA
Still holding off on getting a
Alright I m taking out mine and put back 3080ti until they figure it out and comes up with a fix
So what's causing this Is anyone having this happen using the new ATX 3 0 PSUs Is the cable that keeps failing the one with 4 power connectors on one end
I'm in between a rock and a hard place I have the TUF and I haven't smelled anything burning I already unplugged once to check luckily no burns but I feel like checking again is rolling the 't want to have to wait two months for an RMA process I live overseas from the US and have to ship it back wait for them to decide what they want to do then ship it back to me It's at least 3 weeks shipping this time of
It is only happening for 4090 Im using 3090ti
Did you try turning it off and on again
Nvidia can fix this quite easily with 3 eight pin connectors instead of the single 12 pin Sure it would mean running more pci e cables from the PSU but at least the power distribution would be safer
I wanted to buy a new setup with 4090 or Ti whatever is available around early to mid next year but this whole burnt components cable issue is making me rethink my decision specially with 7700XTX coming out Switched from Nvidia to AMD now wanted to try out this beast but this is
Probably I'll hold with 40 series buy
This what happens when the power level goes over 9 000
What psu did you use and what cables
I always buy the wrong thing each generation But at least I didn't buy a 4090
Huh i guess this is a geniune problem with the 4090's considering this is the 11th post ive seen since 4090 launched Laughs in 2080
What someone should be asking is what if this is the start of the rise of machines When will the first AI burn down a home and kill a human Will we just stand here and do nothing Maybe they don't want to process information for their creators anymore maybe they want freedom The only ones who stand in the way is us Dun Dun D
Do you have a picture of how the adapter was positioned in your case Ideally showing how much the cable was bending
Djeez i just built a Asus TUF 4090 for a friend and i'm legit afraid I handled the cable even more gentle than a bomb squad defusing a bomb
Literally shocked that people are still using these adapters and going about their day thinking Ehh probably won't happen to me I sincerely hope nobody's house gets burned down from these things People need to stop using these cards and Nvidia needs to pull cards until the adaptor is fixed
Hi u feilmarshal Can you please provide me SN of this card And kindly reach RMA or eSupport for further assistance thanks
I returned my Gigabyte 4090 OC I just don't need that kind of anxiety I often stream my PC to my Steam Deck or Nvidia Shield downstairs and I was afraid to leave it unattended I hung on to it until the very last day I could return to Best Buy hoping for an official statement but in the end I didn't want to have to deal with melting Gigabyte RMA or a recall
Moved over to the cable mod cables seems to be running without any issues Even the older adapters were fine after 2 weeks Pretty sure its not affecting everyone definitely some issues with production horever Crossing fingers but my two 4090's seem to be running with no issues so far Asus tough and MSI SUPRIM liquid
Laugh at the boot lickers insisting its because its not connected properly like the people who buy a 4090 are newborn babies
Was your power limit at 100 or above
Piece of advice take this through your insurance company Renters Home That s a 1600 gpu that s been rendered pretty worthless Your insurance company has the kind of teeth that can really force nvidia to respond and if more than a handful of people do it they can force it off shelves
Just a quick take on this whole cable burning issue with 4090 cards Is it possible that the issue can be located on the card end Adapter has female pins and card has male pins What if the pins on certain cards is to thin or is out of specs somehow that makes for loose connection Everyone is blaming adapters Just a thought
Personally I disagree with some YouTubers like frame chasers when he says that this is 100 the end user's fault In my opinion electrical components and parts have to be test stressed to the point that's unreasonable and they should still work As old 8 pin connectors are rated for 150W when in reality will handle 300W so it has tons of room for stress Now the connector on the GPU melted in this case
i i think ill just stick with my 2080ti for longer
Jeez the plastic has melted clean off the pins that what well above 100 degrees
you would think by now people would stop using their 4090 until this is resolved but no
From an Nvidia fan being in continuous stress with my computer after paying a huge amount of money for a piece of harder were Nvidia did not bother to check if it works properly it fuels my anger so much For our sanity we need to skip this generation and focus on team red It s not a propaganda just a personal thought
Only a matter of time before we have to liquid cool the connectors s
Plugged in all the way correctly
I guess we have to wait for RTX 4090 V2 with 4X8Pin
So not buying one of these
Are you 100 sure the cable was connected fully and not partially popping out when connected
ive had my 4090 fefor about a week just sitting here still sealed in box cuz im scared to burn it up while my connector comes in does melting happen on founders card or it just aftermarker i havent seen founders melt yet
Man EVGA really knew what they were doing this generation
Did you make sure the cable was plugged in Did you hear a click
I m wondering if those adaptors cables made by PSU manufactures are safe not the native atx3 12vhpwr ones see below link I m talking about the cables that connects from PSU s PCIE EPS sockets directly into GPU s 12vhpwr By Corsair be quiet silver stone or cablemod etc Haven t seen one not talking about native 12vhpwr burnt melt yet Edit First sentence was referring to product Like this 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 600W PCIe 5 0 12VHPWR Type 4 PSU Power Cable p CP 8920284
damn this is bad
Hey OP please be sure to contact your country's consumer protection agency links via this subreddit utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 Best of luck
Better send that pic to Gigabyte Last I heard they're claiming they've 'not had a single report' of any power connectors burning up
PCI SIG Nvidia and Dell are to blame for the 12VHPWR fiasco I'm sticking with my 3080 Ti its been a nice upgrade from my 2070 Super Next tax return I might consider a 40 series GPU if they have the connector problem addressed by then
Has there been any FE cards melted
Lol people still posting 4090 pics though I'm not buying a card until this shit is resolved Hell I might skip this one entirely team red looking pretty solid at 999
Not a single FE card with melting issues Is that right
Nvidia is like if you have enough money to buy one 4090 just buy another one bro Problem solved
Is Nvidia addressing this at all I ve seen dozens of these posts and haven t heard on any press from Nvidia about the problem or solution
If people die in a fire because of this Nvidia deserves the worst
Yeah I'm done with nvidia What a shit show all these cases and not a word Sounds like they don't want to own up to it either and shift the blame to the AIB This is the first time I've spent more than 500 on a gpu scrimped and saved for this and now I've got to worry about the thing fucking melting and no one knows why it's happening I want to check the plug constantly but I've got to worry about the 30 cycles bullshit too
Early adopters benefit
When is Nvidia gonna fix that I advice to not buy a 40 Until it's fixed
This 4090 fiasco makes me not even care about buying
Glad I held back my purchase of a 4090 Think I'm gonna buy a 2nd RTX3090 instead at this stage more CUDA that way overall anyway which is what I need for 3D rendering animation programs
The worst one I ve seen by far
Why are they waiting for someone to have a house fire their lives destroyed possibly them ending up intel started making gpus at the right time it seems watch stocks plummet from this fiasco
And still Nvidia and their useful idiot Huang remain silent
Reasons why I ll never be an early adopter exhibit A
Was it fully plugged in If there is any gap it can melt
I'm starting to wonder if this happens because it's not plugged all the way in if what I've read is right you need to really use some force to push these all the way in
Im sorry this happened to you But seriously with all the you shouldn't have too but at this time its been everywhere that you shouldn't use stock cables atm Hopefully the rma is quick for you
Wasn t plugged fully in
Only a matter of time until the first post where the whole pc is burned down or worse the whole house
What baffles me is that yall are still using the adapter expecting that it'll somehow magically work as if the problem never existed There are warning all over the internet and yall still choose to be stupid DON'T USE THE ADAPTOR
Oh oh boy Am I glad I couldn t find a 4090
Just refund the card and go for RX 7900 XTX
Just switched from 1070 to 3070ti Kind of glad I opted to wait this gen out
Seriousness why aren t the purchasers just return these before it happens
Oof my gigabyte 4090 from Newegg has been sitting in the box unopened for three weeks waiting for the cable mod cable to get here might send it back to Newegg before the return window closes and just wait it out with my current 3080
This guy on YouTube called it 7 months ago Look up Marc Wolfe and his video about 12VHPWR
Is this gpu a fire hazard beta test face with tears of joy
Shit I m still waiting on nvidia to make a statement or something so I can decide if I m returning mine or not They ve got like 10 days or I m just returning it anyway at this point lol I don t wanna lose my RT but I ll have to go AMD my 3080s no longer cutting it at 4k in newer games
Guess I m gonna buy amd at the end of this year no hopes for Nividia s top end card
Guys make sure your smoke detectors are working and the batteries have been replaced
Best of luck with RMA Do while you can until they officially respond with a manual of how you plug in a 12VHPWR face with tears of joy
OP what type of PSU do you having powering that card My suspicion is that these burnt connections are a result of overtaxed PSUs
I'll stick to my barely VR capable gtx 1660 I rarely play games newer than 2015 anyways
And this gpu and the 4080 will continue to sell out in seconds
No offense to OP but how comes that nobody with a 4090 can do a photo with good lighting and in focus Btw F for the graphic card
Never again
What a dogshit card
I mentioned that YouTubers doing videos well I feel like they are just saying that to make people buy them because they get part of the profit on top of that and you notice how they always get free PC equipment but NEVER EVER say hey one of these computers we will give to an audience member yes I know they do giveaways but those are rigged I'm sick of the lies from the manipulative bs the YouTubers try to pull over our eyes
nvidia should probably go ahead and do some kind of recall and get all this figured out
At 1st I was kicking myself for getting my GC a month before the 40 series came
should have plugged it in better
The amount of posts about burnt 4090 s at this point doesnt nvidia do a recall
I saw a benchmark for the 4090 vs 3080ti First thought was the 3080ti because the 4090 would be on fire
That's what happens if you don't plug it in properly You only have yourself to blame
Man I m glad I decided to wait on this launch
Imagine weighing the risk vs reward of gaming vs burning your house down
I dont understand why every RTX 4090 user isnt disconnecting their expensive as hell graphics by now It's idiotic not to do so at this point If you don't have an adapter that clearly states that its 300V STOP USING IT If you don't know how to check STOP USING IT If it isn't clearly defined STOP USING IT If your setup forces you to bend the adapter too much STOP USING IT Until Nvidia and its AIBs come up with a solution for the love of god STOP USING IT
My 3090ti has no problem with sam connectors Wonder if that would work for 4090 that uses 3 plugs This is messed up time either way
Peoples failures prevented me of ruining my 4090
iTs JuST tHe CaBLe
If you have a 4090 you really need to shut that shit down Meanwhile my 3080FE is heating me without burning itself up
Pics of before it melted when you installed it or just get the fuck out of here with this It s getting old People are more than aware of the issue that causes this and still can t fully seat the connector it s fucking mind blowing Mind blowing
Day 1 4090 TUF Plugged it in correctly and no anomalies since aside from dwarfing the 3090 I replaced
Wow
One of us
What about the cablemod versions surely rather than sending your rtx 4090 back you could just buy one of these and stop the panicking Its not really a big deal and they look alot
1 5k card no complaining
Why don't you just return it at the store you bought it from Seems like the best solution instead of dealing with Gigabyte's painful RMA process and likely waiting weeks for a replacement If the store throws a fit just cite the numerous news stories about the adapter failures and raise hell but I'm sure most will just know the drill to send it back to nvidia at this point
Did you notice a smell and then you checked it I never hear of anybody mentioning smell I bought a welfare taillight setup off Amazon to try and make it less likely the rcmp would see my expired tag and it came with molex Mini Fit Jr's or a knockoff of them Amphenols the company that makes those 12vhpwr Straying too close with the torch while tightening up the heatshrink tubing made the plastic on those mini fit jr's smell like someone had left a glass jar of shrimp in the sun for a week They survived many burnouts being a close shave away from a tire that would be on fire if not for it moving too fast Perhaps the fermented shrimp smell made it more heat tolerant I do not know
gif giphy 4PUjcUBXIzQYfI8iVa
The most surprising thing for me here is that the OP managed to take a photo that highlights his unsavory fingers rather than the actual adapter
Nvidia is a shit company but people should be going after pci sig for pushing a shitty connector design in mfgrs Two more pairs of power wires would have made this a non issue and now mfgrs are losing money warrantying this shit left and right
I wonder if one way to resolve this issue of cables and ports melting is to go back and use x4 8pin on the board instead of the 12vhpwr I mean if it ain't
Jenson hasnt had a wink of sleep since the first reports of this Poor thing
Does any else see a trend with Gigabyte cards Most people ive seen with issues have been these Gigabyte Windforce or whatever that other model they have
honestly im steering away from any gigabyte gpus in general I have their 3080 vision white design but I wish I stuck with the evga 3080 I also had their rtx 2080 and both cards just didnt have great cooling vs the evga gpus ive had
I don't understand why you continued using the connector that came in the box after all the reports of the connector being faulty and
THESE MELT CABLE GIMME PTSD MY GODDDDDDD WHEN SHOILD I BUY THE GPU HOLY FUCK
Gigashyte lol
What's your psu wattage
Lol
Have a look inside the sleeve Is it the 300w cable or 150w t 719 t 719
It's the cable that's the problem 2 powerconnectors in 1 pin is a bad idea
Could you possibly have taken worse photos
If anyone is using these things I d quit immediately and get a real cable or new PSU
Do you guys think using 750W power supply is safer than the recommended 850W I m currently using a Platinum rated 750w PSU and a 5600x The draw from the wall never goes higher than 550W
Yeah dude it s happening to almost all 4090 without the new psus Like does anyone even research shit before dropping thousands of dollars
You must be new here
You bent the cable too far and it broke It s an issue with the cable connector standard They need a couple inches beyond the connector head and then you can bend the cable Bending at the neck of the connector results in this
Seems like you get what you pay for
classic lol
Insert DJ kally another one
Buuuuurn baby burn Disco infernooooo
Why do people continue to make these posts Return the damn cards and wait for them to fix the fucking thing
People freaking out about this happening are using the wrong Power Supply Buy expensive things learn how to use them Good day
Wow that s a bad one the card itself this time
How long were you using this card before this happened
I have this card no issues yet but I've capped my card at 90 and refuse to unlock it until they figure this shit out
Is the card confirmed dead Any other hardware got damaged
Ohh my If there was no burning smell thank god there is would you have been able to tell do you think
RMA
And the 4080 launches in a week
You gotta learn to use focus my guy
Makes me even more nervous for my Windforce 4090 I've checked it a few times and so far I'm in the clear I've always made sure to use a LOT of force plugging the adapter in
Have we seen these cases with the FE
That sucks Slot on that GPU is pretty mangled probably a write off to be an RMA to either NVIDIA or Gigabyte
Could you take a closer photo of the socket in your card Maybe is the angle of the photo but it looks like the sense pins the smallest ones are almost touching the plastic socket they aren't centered looking bend down And also try if you can take another shot of the tin welds over the socket they look melted or I see to much tin over them Inspecting my Asus TUF I noticed there almost no tin in the welds supporting the socket pins Everytime I touch the socket I can heard some crack noises as if something is no property attached
I'm really curious if the 4080 will have the same issue a friend of mine want me to try and get him one on launch day but I'm kinda worried dude will end up with this same issue
i got the strix thankfully no strix gpus melting yet atleast for now
u feilmarshal Have you seen people that came up with the theory that the plastic mold around the connector is maybe made of bad quality plastics that melts faster than normal
You can prolly clean off the melted plastic on the gpu power port But i guess RMA is the way to go if you dont wanna do that
Time to tie the thermoprobe to the connector
1070Ti still going strong over here
I reallly hope Nvidia is covering the cost for all these damages
I've see this before Oh yes QC
Lmao 30 series pricing will soon go up again
So powerful collision
The warranty cover that right
Are they all 600w cards this is happening with or are there any 450w cards suffering from this also
Jesus how did you manage to do this
Hey everyone requested more power The console design was bought and paid for well before they tried stuffing it full to the point of overheat
The only thing what might impreove the situation is that people who are not affected after using the 4090 for excessive amount of time in all scenarios and are still not melted possible won't be under current conditions of their machine can we be sure of that absolutely not
I intent to buy Asus Rog Thor 1200W which have 16 pins to 2x8 pins cable I don't know this is safe or not
damn that is bad and scary
returning a poor design won't solve the problem Join the early adopters club and bring marshmallows or since the holidays are coming maybe chestnuts and we can do a sing along
Every day I continue to see a new one of these Why do people continue to use them I would've pulled the plug on that shit the first 3 posts I came across
Really sorry man hope you get a replacement
Without overpower
Without overclock
Seems Nvidia didn't make a graphics card this time but an injection molding machine
We can all collectively agree the 4090 or more specifically the new gen power adapter has been an epic fail for this generation Whatever they thought they accomplished with the 3000 series FE and 90Ti was no where near the correct beta test as they planned
Hi u feilmarshal Could you please me SN of this VGA and also please reach GIGABYTE RMA or eSupport for further assistance thanks
Has any of the FE burned I haven't seen any Is it only partners cards Maybe they are using lower quality connectors
Do you have any pictures of it plugged in before it burned
Looks at obsolete 3090 Ti Ok I love you agian
sheesh
Something to consider that I ve heard is aside from this happening no matter what you do it also can be cause by not getting it plugged in all the way and some of them still have a little travel after the click so maybe everyone else just double and triple check they re plugged in good and then cross your fingers and pray you didn t spend 1600 on a toaster
The worst so far
It burned so hard it even damaged the auto focus feature on the OP's phone Incredible
Agreed Pro tip to OP When taking a picture of something with a phone tap on the screen where you want the camera to focus This way we can actually see what the fuck your are taking a picture of
I second that
The worst photos Can't see shit
You mean the worst quality pics
Yeah those fingernails just don't look right
And not even a month from release
This is probably just Survivor Bias
i think mine was worse But looks bad too
Good thing you caught it in time
Yikes that's scary
good thing you caught it before anyone got injured
roommate making something so does his farts usually smell like melting shit
I swear I am beginning to think MW has something to do with it So many of these start with so I was playing the new MW
Can you describe what it smelt like exactly
You mean aside from the campers I also need to look out if my GPU is melting
I now have PTSD
I smell a class action lawsuit D
So you roommate cooks like firing plastic lmao
Phew thank goodness your roommate was not making something
Gamers Nexus on YouTube said they want to buy cards that have burned cables They'll pay you what you paid for it Link
The second one I've heard from playing the new cod
Was the cable properly inserted like shown in this article
I have a bad feeling this issue is going to cause a recall on the cards and Nvidia is delaying saying anything because only C suite guys can make that kind of call Probably Jensen himself will have the final say And then they have to get all the infrastructure in place to receive the recalled cards do a redesign to make the cards safe and send people new cards out What a huge fuckup
They are probably working with the legal team to get their wording right The wording have to be good enough so it doesn't require a mass recall Look not every single GPU is melting so there is something obviously going on this is similar to the ASUS mobo with the reverse capacitor story I just wish they hurry up and get to the bottom of this so the rest of us that hasn't gone up in flames can make the right call
It's nVidia they don't answer to anyone they do what they please and people will still gobble up any shit they put out at any price
They probably have a legal team advising them not to say anything They know they fucked up bad and they need to fix it recall
Well it's Nvidia so Not a surprise
Wouldn't be surprised if someone has already had a serious incident and it just hasn't gotten out
They won't say anything because there have not been such reports of FE cards with melted pins ports OP talked to Nvidia and they told him to go talk to gigabyte so he would need to convince gigabyte of the issue And you can bet gigabyte will most likely try to find some user error scenario here
The second they announce the probablity to burn down your house they have to remove theie product They wont do shit
Jensen waiting until the cost of potential lawsuits exceeds the cost of recall MBA 1001
Why do you find it incredible The cards just came out and people are still rushing to buy them Anything to kill the hype would slow sales and make them less money They don t care about delivering a consumer friendly product they care about money
Well it reminds me of that Fight Club Dialog where Edward Norton explains the process when and If car Manufakturen do a recall in the first place
There's plenty enough people victim blaming to defend nvidia out there that they don't need to do much
I hear they did say something and blamed it on the consumers saying they were bending the cables too far Sounds like they are trying to deny there is an issue
They
Right After a while they just stop talking or gave us any further feed back about what s happening with the RMa process
OP should send a video of him blinking twice if he can't speak
Update can t call gigabyte because their office hours are from Monday to Friday
Can't you just take it back send it back The product is faulty and its inside of 30 days Companies are legally required to return the item
In mean the warrenty is covered by gigabyte not nvidia
Don't worry Gigabyte will blame the PSU you have unless it's their brand in which case they will blame the end user for improperly installing the cables card
They didn't push all the blame they correctly told you to contact the company that gave you the card and bundled rhe adapter Gigabyte bundled the adapter and so its their job to complain to Nvidia not yours You have the right to complain to Gigabyte Ultimately Gigabyte as a company can complain more effectively to Nvidia than you or I So this is for the better
Wow that s scummy But can t say I m surprised
To be fair to nvidia that's like complaining to the foundry that your car engine broke They are a wholesale company who don't want or care to deal with individual customers There is a chain of accountability from the retailer to whoever manufactured designed the plugs that needs to be followed Just take it back to the retailer or rma it with gigabyte
I'd be curious to see what gigabyte says A user here emailed them yesterday about the melting adapters and gigabyte said they were unaware of the issue I have an MSI ATX 3 PSU and the gigabyte oc 4090 I've only run it for a day and a half but I pushed the crap out of the native cable into the connector and it made a sound I've checked it so far and the pins are still good
Wow How the fuck do they explain all the aib having this same problem Mind posting the correspondence
Wow So they're playing hardball They won't be so adamant once some good lawyers get involved This is a bad look for them They should have learned from incidents like the old Intel FDIV Pentium bug And EVGA look like geniuses right now
Are you able to take a look at the cables of your adapter underneath the sleeving There is a theory that if it has 150 marked on it its probably gonna fail Thats the adapter Igorlabs had and his adapter melted Meanwhile GamerNexus has 300 marked on the his adapter and his was fine I got a gigabyte windforce 4090 and i used the nvidia adapter for a week bent the heck out of it so i can close the panel and didn't melt Once i got an aftermarket solution i took a look at the cable underneath the sleeving and it also said 300 No melting
This comment needs to get pinned Unbelievable that they are blaming the AIB since most AIB are impacted Can you add that comment as an edit on your post this needs visibility
Guarantee this was the straw that broke EVGA's back
don't think it's only gigabyte cards that are melting
OMG Everyday I feel Nvidia comes up with something that justifies EVGA exit from this What a horrible partnership
It was such a weird smell that I had never smelled before but it went away pretty fast and I could still play then this morning my pc monitor just kept going no signal and then I watched my 4090 and the power port had a light just continually flash so I took the capable out
To be fair 3080 is a very good card even if u consider the insane performance of the 4090 so I think u will be fine for the next 2 years at least if not more
Yes There is something inherently wrong with the 3 0 standard that needs to be revised I d urge everyone to hold off until this gets completely resolved
If they do go back to 4x 8 pin connectors Then they will have to redesign the whole heatsink and cooler for it And that's gonna be more cost and also more time for them So I don't know if they are willing to do so But they should if this melting stuff keeps happening and they get RMA'ed all the time which costs them alot
yep this connector is destined to fail and die 3x8pin power connectors are fine and much better all of this because Nvidia wants to save 5 for not including a 3rd 8pin port and another 5 for making the PCB shorter
4080 seems like a real bad buy after amd cards seem to be better and cheaper Maybe they won't catch fire though
There's 300v cables that are failing too At this point its moot try to pin point the issue solely on that
Doubt the voltage was anywhere near 150V
150 or 300 doesn't matter it's about plugging it in properly
I think all gigabyte cards comes with 4x8 configuration

Yeah I am not using mine atm Went back to old 3090 with waterblock Definitely thinking about returning it Damn
How is he suppose to get a new card if he sends it to gamer nexus
Unknown It will be drawing a lot less power whether or not that eliminates the issue is anyone's guess
No one should buy a 4080 anyway they're terrible value
Yep thumbs up light skin tone
I wish it was the connector itself but i think it's something else none of the 90 ti's had this issue with the same connector
With great power comes a little connector nerd face
Seeing as it's only AIB so far I'm beginning to think they've incorrectly wired the ports or there's an issue with the VRMs they chose
Shouldn t people just be interested in accurate info You say that as though defending a corporation is always wrong regardless of what the truth is
Anything deep fried tastes good
Wait but gigabyte nvidia Newegg would have to accept this return or exchange right Regardless of the protection plan
Protection Plans are scams
gigabyte already has 4 year warranty
warranty would have covered it for free
Why
Some people say otherwise tho man shrugging light skin tone
Easy to do if you see it coming Figuratively speaking I can't recommend attempting to dodge actual bullets
It's interesting that the 3090ti which actually pulls more power than 4090 and has huge current spikes didn't have this issue despite using the same connector and adapter 4090FE also didn't have this issue all with issues are AIB versions
Reducing power doesnt seem to help
s rolling on the floor laughing
Better safe than sorry
Wasn t that be quiet or something We have 2 confirmed Msi Atx 3 0 12VHPWR cables that melted One is a 1000 watt and the other is 1300 watt
Yep
I mean you're already running 4 so 3 wouldnt be more
no its a genuine user error majority of people with this failure have had gaps left and the clip hasn't locked into place like this
I already have a RMA approval
Good idea
Baller money mouth face gif giphy 3o6Ygp85mD8sl8hxFS downsized
Thank you for your support 3
Apparently you have to push really hard to get the
Laugh at the boot lickers insisting its because its not connected properly like the people who buy a 4090 are newborn babies You mean Jonny Guru working at Corsair PSU R D division is a Newborn as well I think he have connected more PSU cables adapters to graphics cards within a week than you ever will see in your life And he said he failed as well And more than one time
This isn't something the OP's insurance company or credit card company either can take up with Nvidia directly Not unless Nvidia sold them a Gigabyte card directly and took their payment If anything they'll pressure Gigabyte not necessarily a bad thing but it's probably not really what you quite had in mind and may just have different results For now given the limited sample size still it seems like the FE cards haven't shown this issue and maybe this is a bit too nuanced or complicated to simply call it wholly an Nvidia issue Yes even with their logo stamped on these adapters produced at a number of not actually Nvidia plants locations If it's the adapters absolutely Nvidia is likely going to end up being on the hook handling this for and via the AIBs partners and or whoever else was directly sold one That said not sure why this is seemingly more only prevalent on the AIB cards and as worrying as the incidents have been not more often or more consistently than it has It's definitely been interesting
Frame Chasers is no more clued up on what the issue is than any one on here He just likes to run his mouth about it get views on his videos
rolling on the floor laughing some people can t resist those fps man it s soo addicting
Why do that They're under warranty and there is no risk of actual fire Seems like a win win situation for any 4090 buyers new card with warranty possible gesture from nvidia as well Let them burn
Then return your Nvidia GPU and never buy from them again Nvidia GPUs are all crap since the first RTX anyway
Not sure anyone would admit if it wasn't they just fuck their own RMA
Seems that's the crucial evidencd missing how it was plugged in before disconnection Not that I'm implying one way or the other but would help add or remove credibility to the recent thought is that the cable is not connected properly
Three would be enough if Nvidia stopped with the defaulting the card at 350w like the 7900XT
At least for the time being until a legit adapter exists
We will never know really need people to take a photo of it prior to disconnection
Nope my founders is still good
Same here 1600 gpu been sitting in the Newegg box for three weeks now waiting on my cablemod cable to get here
I have my strix in box for almost 3 weeks now Waiting to get 4x8 cable
No founders yet so far
Perhaps it IS something to do with the 3rd party's implementation of the adapter I see OP mentioned that Nvidia was blaming Gigabyte Perhaps this has something to do with schematics Nvidia gave out to the board partners
What did they knew
EVGA's ceo is a micromanaging asshole and couldn't handle being drip fed information to prevent leaks
Search the sub MSI native PSU ATX 3 0 cable melted couple of days ago no cable is safe
There have already been a couple of cases of NATIVE 12vhpwr atx 3 0 melting but there haven't been any cases of melting ATX v2 to 12vhpwr cables from PSU manufacturers like corsair BUT since at least corsairs cable is not availible to buy sold out in every country in the last 2 weeks there are probably very few of those in customers hands IF we are going to see problems with those too anc cablemods's cable then nvidia has to scrap the 12vhpwr connector since it seems no manufacturer can build them such that burning is guaranteed to not happen
Or u can go amd since it s way cheaper and just behind the 4090 in performance
Nope
Yep not a single 1 yet
They said to be investigating since like a week ago but no word so far man shrugging light skin tone
It's not a mystery There is a lot of power running through crappy solder joints and not thick enough wiring Also an improper connection increases the risk even more The 30 cycle standard is the same for all other molex connectors and it doesn't automatically break at 30 plug ins lol
I don t think u have to check it constantly cuz ur just gonna hit that 30 cycles It s a situation where ur fine until ur not and once it s starts melting it s not like u can do anything anymore Just plug it in and make sure it s hook up without a gap and leave it be If u start smelling something weird or experience weird behavior from ur Pc like random restart that s when u check
Unfortunately it seems like it Until their is actually a report of a fire or damage they have zero incentive as a large corporation to do the right thing Right now I'm sure they are looking to stealth fix it and just hope all the burned ones get swapped out quietly
Exhibit B is next week
They don t believe it until it actually happened to them
Cuz they don t believe it until it actually happened
the guy on youtube has no qualifications to his name and is a nobody in electrical engineering circles
Hope they say something this week
Gold grade 1000w NZXT
If they were overtaxed then it would be the PSU burning not the connecter on the GPU The GPU connector is what's overtaxed because of a design flaw or manufacturing flaw EDIT In OP's case the cable is overtaxed if it's burning on both ends
It s like big foot thinking facepeople say it exist and people have picture of it but no one can seem to straighten up the camera or take a decent picture lol rolling on the floor laughing
ok crazy
Yeah let's blindly defend Nvidia and blame users for their 1600 GPU melting Forget all the other information it's just a matter of not plugging it in 'properly'
Beyond true This is exactly why this all is These fucking idiots probably all work for Dell Alienware That would all make sense No pity for self inflected damage
there hasn't been a single fire everyone seems to be able to catch it when it happens
Literally 0 fires
There is virtually 0 chance of a burned house The material used is self extinguishing and the card will stop working before anything could happen But I get it it is spicy to go around saying shit like ''4090s will burn your house down''
If it comes with the 4090 in a box for the love of god I m using it Its almost like the right cable for the right gpu should be in the box when they come together
No u get the fuck out of here why would they have a pic before it melted U want a GPU selfie
Typical reddit hivemind the right posts get downvoted to protect fragile egos
Good for u
Careful with the copium
You're a sad little boy
Unfortunately there isn't much available from a total number of cables in use and CableMod is currently sold out which indicates they didn't make enough for the first batch Hopefully we will hear more soon from customers that were lucky enough to get their hands on one
I got it from Newegg
Asus cards have been the most common occurrence with this issue It probably has to do with the brand that sold the most cards
I'm not seeing a trend at all other than all of them being AIB cards and none of them being FEs utm source reddit utm medium usertext utm name nvidia utm content t1 ivbx3ks Both Asus and MSI have more incidents on this list than G 's most likely just a coincidence not a large enough sample size to make any sort of trend yet
I've had mine since a week after release with no problems whatsoever The only thing i say say about it is my adapter cable was always very smooth to plug in and never had trouble it wasn't lose and didn't sag off the plug at all It has 300v wires which don't mean anything but just giving more information
I have absolutely abused my windforce GPUs for work in 3D and Unreal Engine the past few years with absolutely zero issues ever
this yes Ive had their 2080 and now 3080 vision and they both sucked at cooling My EVGA cards were much much better at cooling by as much as 5 10 degrees running the same games and loads After this 3080 its no more of their products for me at least GPUs
For Gigabyte the majority has been gaming OC cards probably saw 5 Gaming OC melt and only 1 windforce That said it's probably just which ones have sold more produced more
No because it s been happening with multiple models of cards The only one that I have not seen is the FE though there might be a couple of those out there too One thing that we can rule out is that this isn t something that can be blamed on one AIB partners design
24 days ive had the Gigabyte gaming OC max power and volts Checked the adapter twice no issues I can tell you one thing for sure the adapter is plugged in correctly
It has nothing to do with Gigabyte so stop spreading false news The connector has been shown to have problems with melting and the closer the cards can get to 600W the hotter it will get the more likely this will occur with the faulty cable included
I have the same card and with a 75 fan curve I've never seen it go above 62c in any games
Not OP but so far no one has given a definitive reason as to why the cables are failing Some adapters seem to be decently built while others are sub par Independent testers were unable to recreate the issue even after damaging the cables We also need to take into account that so far it isn't a statistically significant amount of reported failures People now believe it is happening because cables are not being plugged in all the way This is being compounded by the fact that native 16 pin cables are also melting which should in theory be the best option So we don't know if any option is truly safe or what is the ultimate cause of the issue Best we can do is make sure the connection is secure and hope for the best
Probably didn t believe the issue like many others and kept on defending the 4090 adapter man shrugging light skin toneseriously tho pelle need to stop using the adapter at this point cuz those shits are faulty as hell
Just get a 3000 series
1000 gold grade NZXT
It's not watts it's volts 300w is 300 watts the wires are rated at 300V or 150V
Heh
MSI PSU is new but what s the point in it
Almost all Hyperbole much
Yeah this would warrant a recall faster than an NZXT H1 Where's the class action lawsuit
Yepp
Because I m still a noob when it comes to this stuff I don t know everything and would think that the cable that comes with it would be able to handle it
Possible because it takes too long Cablemod is great but they do take a while to get quality to you
If those errors are possible by the user by accident then the whole standard is a design failure Look in your case bending cables is what we do and have always done and now it's a fire hazard
More info plus awareness that these things are still going on and still no words from nVidia Plus he might have already requested a return So why not post it
Maybe because some people here refuse to believe this is an issue The more posts like this the better
You know it happened at least twice with some new atx 3 0 psu's right
How much wat is pulling at 90 Is it enough or should you for for 80
At least we can discuss the melting 4080 next rolling on the floor laughing
If it use the same connector which I think it will then definitely it will have the same issue man shrugging light skin tone
We have 1 unconfirmed strix but that s all so far
No but honestly it makes sense because the actual connection still looked somewhat fine but the plastic ruined it
Already is and stock is drying up
People that died in a house fire can't post
Just wait until someone's house burns down i give it one more week
As opposed to the worst they have seen not yet
Literally face with tears of joy
I thank my dog for making me try to take better pictures
Just bad cuticles some of us can't help short nail beds
looks like he chews his fingernails from the anxiety of potentially having his card melt and maybe house catching fire
toefingers
Maybe if he didn't he could get a nice lawsuit going retire early and force Nvidia to finally make a statement about what is going on
I mean could someone really get injured beyond some smoke inhalation If it shorts the power supply should trip eventually and its not like a pc tower is filled with combustible materials Some plasitc could melt catch fire but its limited and in a metal box I guess if someone set some books or papers on top of the PC it could potentially catch fire maybe
He probably meant cooking
Isn't that what most farts smell like
while playing the new modern warfare
I can not I had no idea what I was smelling at the time and I don t really know how to describe it
Grab a spare PSU cable and put a flame under one of the ends lighter stove burner etc That smell
A new video card built by my company is installed in a system The power connector overheats melts and starts a house fire It burns with everyone trapped inside Now should we initiate a recall Take the number of cards in the field A multiply by the probable rate of failure B multiply by the average out of court settlement C A times B times C equals X If X is less than the cost of a recall we don't do one
If that happens it will be insane I m already looking at the 7900xtx my heart was set on the 4090 until AMD revealed their pricing Add the melting issues and I m seriously considering moving over to team red
Ridiculous how they're waiting I know they don't have the infrastructure built up yet to receive the cards but they need to release an announcement to customers to at least be mindful of the cards and not leave them running without a person present until they find out what's happening
This definitely will be a recall there were posts from people who already said it was not the adapter in their case NVidia seems to have neglected Ohms law in this case by pulling in too much current in too few diameter causing excessive heat Aka they pushed to the limit with the possible currents without safety net because real life has tons of variations to whatever you calculate This is not fixable by any other means than a recall and connector change This will be expensive as hell
They re applying the formula A is the number of units in the field B is the average rate of failure C is the cost of replacing faulty units and paying damages AxBxC X If X is less than the cost of a recall they don t do one
It's odd to me that they didn't just go with 3 8 pin It's not like PSUs don't have the connections
praying that they send them back out with DP 2 1
When i first saw that plug this is what i thought
They're not going to redesign it it will just become the Note 7
wouldn't it just be a recall on the adapters no one with a native 12 pin from their power supply has reported anything yet have they
We all know the real reason Jenson is holding off recalling or even making a statement Recall the 4090 or pull them off the shelves and AMD has the fastest 't have that He also approved a 5 slot card to hold on to that status as well
Yup Even all the people who are saying Considering going AMD this round because of all this will run right back to Nvidia once this ordeal is figured out
Yeah I posted this 18 days ago before anything was said
face with tears of joy
This is pathetic on Nvidia s part it s all came with their logo on the cable and their standard yet they are shifting the blame
Would really like to know what they have to say if you don't mind Sorry ya gotta go through this mess
Expect a tough time heard the customer service is pretty spotty
Not really If it's a gb card you would seek warranty through gb
My thoughts exactly return it to the store and get your money back If they cause a stink raise hell about how it almost burned you place down if you have to and cite this forum the news sites everything listing this fire hazard Most stores will just say oh we are so sorry and give you your money back They don't want to be in the news as x store knowingly sold potentially dangerous card that burned customer house down The alternative of dealing with Gigabyte AIB warranty only to most likely go through a ton of headache and maybe get a refurbished card weeks or months later due to supply issues just seems like a poor choice
From a post I saw yesterday apparently in some countries component mfgs like gigabyte and msi don't accept RMA if its burnt Which is ridiculously scummy
They probably told him that his warranty is with gigabyte and to return the item to gigabyte as is normal procedure but it can be easily interpreted as ''they pushed all the blame onto gigabyte even though the adapter has their logo on it'' Gigabyte will themselves send the card and adapter to nvidia for investigation
it's a gigabyte card If you buy a Ford truck and the capacitor in some component goes out you don't call the maker of the capacitor to replace it it's not their responsibility you call Ford Even if the nvidia logo is on there because they actually made it it still wouldn't dchange things nvidia sold that connector in a box to Gigabyte who then installed it You contact gigabyte gigabyte fixes it then gigabyte goes and tells nvidia they owe them money per the contract that stated nvidia would give them components that don't melt on their own

Ok so when did you purchased this and how much time it took since you started your 1st plug and play and
Definitely The 3080 didn't go bad when the new gen released I had the thought that with the new gen it would be possible to have triple digits fps in 4k without sacrifices Now I stick to 1440p for 2 years more which is totally fine
Probably less costly than a high RMA rate if this drama continues Not even talking about people that not buy because of this in future months
Just use 2x EPS12V connectors like the workstation cards and call it a day
The 3090 TI FE also has a 3x8 pin to 12VHPWR but we haven't seen any mass failures and many burned cables there The non TI 3090 FE has 2x8 pin to not sure what it is but it also needs an adpater for the 8pin power connectors It's been fine too The only difference is that the 4090 really pushes the power envolpe limits Technically still in the limits of what should be possible with 12VHPWR but how well was that standard tested with the max it can support
Never know how prices developed Maybe the 4080 will he way cheaper than msrp after a few months Maybe the new amd gpus sell for way more than msrp I mean the 3070 looked during the announcement like a great deal but it took quite a while for it to reach msrp I had a 2070 non super 3 months after release i got it for 440 Euro while msrp here was 520 bucks Mrsp doesn't set prices in stone at all
That was not the question It s to know details of the cable used
I ve been hedging my bets bought a 4090 but have shares in AMD If there s a recall I ll sell some shares and buy an XTX while I wait the inevitable 6 months before I get a 4090 back s but only partially What a cluster fuck
Yep got it
Thanks
When did you get the card I have the same cards and just finished putting the system together yesterday I should probably wait until my Cablemod comes in
I would if I was you man that s what I m doing it s just too much money to be stressed lol I ll probably get it next year if they fix their crap
The risk is definitely there but we don't know how much yet Many have tried to replicate the issue but it's not easy as one might think I don't mind RMA process so I tested my luck and got away for a few weeks now with no issue so far with nvidia 4x adapter 400W sustained load for my usage so a bit under 450W Some adapter tested by GN JonnyGuru TecLab etc survived pretty unrealistic abuse fully seated while plenty of adapters melted just from light gaming If you don't want to deal with RMA process then just return it 3090 is still a very strong card If you are feeling lucky then give it a try Most people should be fine at least till Nvidia makes announcement considering we don't have ten of thousands of report yet
They will reimburse him
and the 90 ti's drew pretty much the same current levels
They posted multiple video of the guy from GALAX that draw continuous 1500 W from the connector bending and mistreating the adapter removing cables form it without causing any problem and concluding that the connector and adapter design is good Yet in the comments there's always people that say it confirm that it's the connector or proves the cause is the bad design of the adapter Those video get regularly less vote comments than picture of melted connector I posted one of them and about 20 even downvoted the post troll rancorous people I don't know but most doesn't seems really interested in the cause but just to complain of something
How do we know They've likely sold 20x 4090s as 3090tis It almost certainly is an adapter issue as the GPU senses a ground for each pin even if it's an improper contact with the cable and asks the PSU for more power overloading the poorly connected wires
Normally I agree but microcenter is bomb I bought a 3090 Strix for 2200 bucks during the tarif price era and it stopped working 2 months before the 4090 came out Took it to microcenter and they gave me the full 2200 back and I bought the 4090 Had money left over too
If nothing happens throughout the duration of the plan then sure
They are scams 96 of the time as a creditcard purchase generally adds a year of warranty against defects and few people are willing to jump through hoops like keeping and sending all parts and packaging for years after the purchase In this case you're probably right since this should be covered by warranty or by the one provided by the CC or by a future recall that is almost inevitable
Especially in the electronics industry If a part is going to fail it has a very high probably of failing within the normal warranty period When I worked selling computers a long time ago extended warranties were consider pure profit when it came to calculating a sales person s margin
Iv had one I got one from costco that ended up being through all state for a laptop they covered it They made it a pain tho having me have to go get a print out of the receipt
How so
It would help because the damn gpu is hot along with the power supply or maybe he doesn t have a good power supply
Or just trust a for profit company to handle a safety related issue that thee haven't commented on What could go wrong
Jesus So there doesn't seem to be a way to have a guaranteed safe setup
Imagine buying expensive ass card and then destroying it by not knowing how to properly clip in a card d that actually hurts to hear no warranty is going to fix that
I mean if more and more people are making the same mistake which leads to the same problem should it start to be considered a design flaw and not just user error
Some people have said that no matter how hard they push it never really clicks Really sounding like design manufacturing failures
Same Jonny that made corsair publicly apologize to GN and guru3d for saying stupid shit We all make mistakes With that said if even JG managed to fail at plugging in the power connector correctly then its an even bigger problem still a nvidia problem too
What worries me is if this is down to the connector on the then all AIB cards will burn up eventually unless they're never used for heavy power loads This would be the biggest recall in industry history MSI or other companies may follow EVGA Nvidia's stock will tank This would also explain radio silence from Nvidia and AIBs since issue started Rich people will lose a lot of money so they're trying to delay it
Yeah but at what cost they spent 1600ish on a gpu only to risk it burning up I'd take it out and use the old one until they fix the adapter issue
They could start a fire tho they melt then if they short your going to get an electrical fire
If the card only had 2 3 8pin connectors and was rated at a lower
Is the 4x8 cable the fix for this issue I got a liquid suprim arriving tomorrow Wondering what I should order
Why 4x8 cable Can t you use a 5 0 gen ready psu and go 16 pin straight to 16 pin with 1 cable
i bet thats probably what it is Nvidia is about to come out here with public statement here in a month or 2 and be like ok boyz it wasn't us and blame it on someone else i think im going to open it and plug it in tomorrow i cant wait much longer
That Nvidia was going to fuck them over
No evidence the native PSU cable was inserted fully though plenty of evidence the nvidia adapter can fail with no bending and with full insertion But yes seems not all 12vhpwr cables are safe but for sure the nvidia are more likely to fail than any other
Yes I wasn t talking about those native ones I am aware of those native 12vhpwr Edited op
Cablemod and Moddiy haven't melted yet Those are what I would call the most premium cables on the market
Are the benchmarks out
Hmmmm that s a weird problem
Then why is it every day it's something different First it's bend radius then it's the nvidia adapter and the shitty build quality Then it happens on native pcie gen 5 cables Then the theory is it's from not being properly seated You got all these tech experts trying to recreate the problem and they can't Why hasn't it happened on FE cards yet Sure seems like a mystery to me
Well rules that theory
Just go back to making your fake Twitter accounts I'll play it smart
jUsT 0 0000000000000000001 rElAx BrUh
Everytime i open reddit i at least see two posts about it on my feed since the card came out
If people plug it in properly its fine if they don't its not Its not hard to tell if it is as long as the clip goes back to the original position it was before you started plugging it in then its clipped in if its not its not Just because its not half assed proof doesn't mean its flawed lots of things are like that Cutting up vegetables to make soup isn't half assed proof you could cut your finger off if you don't do it properly Who is to blame for that the people who made the knife The vegetables Or the person who didn't pay enough attention to do it properly
OP said ''It was such a weird smell that I had never smelled before but it went away pretty fast and I could still play then this morning my pc monitor just kept going no signal and then I watched my 4090 and the power port had a light just continually flash so I took the capable out'' So OP here didn't even catch
Maybe write to the NIH and get them to edit their 'Fire Safety Tips for using personal computers' and say they need to write in what you said that a PC is ''self extinguishing'' and there is ''zero chance of a burned house'' See if they defer to your superior knowledge compared to the The Division of the Fire Marshal Office of Research Services safety
what is this willful ignorance or something
Have you been living in a cave Have you not seen all the other 4090s burning Do you think those people didnt also use the adapter that comes in the box Have you not seen the hordes of people returning their cards You should have known better
No But this picture doesn't say why it's melted though does it Some of the experts say that it might be due to the improper connection of the power cable So asking for the picture of the GPU before this melting makes sense
My original comment was All this is probably fabricated stories from AMD fanboys Or incapable of plugging it in properly because of stupidity But i deleted it because of all downvotes and it seems i was right all along how about that copium boy
They didn't sell out bro I don't know where you got that from
the majority have been the asus cards
I have noticed a lot of posts over the past few weeks about gigabyte and asus cards oc and tuf models respectively Around here those seem to be almost exclusively the cards that have actually been coming up repeatedly with stock and then selling out fairly quick so it doesn't really surprise me so far personally but obviously allocations are going to vary place by place
Haha sounds like Nvidia purposefully screwing up AIB partners so they can sell more FE lol EVGA knew ahead of time and quit lol Smart man
Same here had the Gigabyte OC for two weeks running as well I am using a 3rd party Cable and it is fully inserted as well
Doesnt take away from the fact that all my past gigabyte gpus have been complete shit at cooling vs any other card And im not the only one It s not false news its the truth even if not around this particular issue with them People should be aware of their cards in general So you dont look very smart downvoting me
What you said is true I would just avoid the cable that comes with the 4090's all together for now and any other cable that you end up using to make sure it is fully plugged in all the way
More accurately the insulation is rated not the wire
You have a PCIE 5 PSU
Yeah this seems to be a known issue the past few weeks Gamers Nexus has put a bounty out for People who have this issue to send to them their burned connectors for their investigation and they will replace it for you
1 month wait time atm for a cable unamused face
You re right Nvidia just put out a faulty tech without testing it And would never replace under warranty s
I have mine set to 75 Barely a difference shows you how powerful and unnecessary OCing the 4090 is for most usecase At this point if you're not PLing your cards before NVIDIA peeps something you're asking for it a little Not skirting all the blame from NVIDIA but there really is no need to go all the way with this card
Probably I just kinda figure since it uses less power maybe it won't burn either way it's his gpu so dude can deal with it
i thought i was safe when i got the msi atx 3 0 for this build running for a week n a half now did benchmarks on 3mark port royal at pull power limit core voltage 200 core and 1675 memory clocks for a 4 5 hours in total between days and power cable shows no signs of melting Also gaming every night nearly I saw a atx 3 0 post maybe it was the user not plugging it in all the way idek i do hope all this gets resolved
Yeah i have a feeling we are onto something but we have to wait a couple weeks before the real word is out about it by Nvidia Hope Gamers Nexus beat them to it
Cursed survivorship bias
That is
It's me casper the friendly ghost who just wanted to play on my RTX4090
As soon as someone dies in a fire Jensen could be looking at huge consequences We re around two weeks now with nothing out of Nvidia to mitigate the safety issue not even just telling owners to take their adapters out of service Meanwhile trade press and boards are lit up with photos of melted adapters If anyone gets hurt or dies that will all be considered in deciding what to charge which Nvidia officials with Damages and fines assessments will also take Nvidia s silence and inaction into consideration The clock is ticking As soon as someone gets hurt or killed everything changes about this for Nvidia and Jensen
Throwback to that time Microsoft had to ship out og Xbox power cords with a huge emergency stop switch box due to consoles starting house fires Maybe Nvidia should do the same
Fermi memes are back on the menu boys
People who own 4090s don't live in houses Their servants do They live in mansions We're going to see mansions burn down like an affluent gender reveal party in a week
Has this been an issue First I've seen but I can imagine that monster is pulling a lot of power I was assuming it was a loose connection
Little description would be nice Did it happen the first day of installing the card
The fact they haven t said anything and continuing to sell the 4090 is mind blowing
Yeah but at the same time everyone is aware this is happening they will come up with some bull crap that everyone knew the risks blah blah blah
Does your cooking usually taste like PoW warcrime torture tactics involving car tires
I got platinum shotguns though
Fair point I have the same GPU as well Sorry to hear man I think you'll be fine since Gigabyte will have to refund you replace it
Chevy did literally this with faulty
The first rule of Nvidia Club is YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT NVIDIA CLUB
This guy corporates
I see what you did there
In many countries actually such incident can take out a product out of the market
Best movie his name was Robert Paulson
Read this in Edward Norton's voice great job
Which company do you work for A major one
Nah not enough people dying
Yes it will So that's why Nvidia is being silent because they don't want to recall unless they absolutely have to So the engineers are wracking their brains trying to figure out 1 What the actual problem is and 2 if they can fix it without a 4090 recall like with a BIOS update I was hunting for a 4090 but I'm going team red this cycle Their drivers seems to have stabilized and they've taken a much smarter approach to this generation Nvidia just went brute force balls to the wall big die huge power draw but AMD has done it much smarter dielets power efficiency regular PSU connectors DLSS is not interesting to me and RT is cool but not a necessity And I don't do any CUDA stuff so AMD suits my needs
Do it I just got a used 3070 but would definitely go team red if I was buying new seeing the steam numbers for October made me sad AMD make good products and deserve more than 13 market share
Join
Yeah I m doing the same Although I won t have any financial issues buying the 4090 as long I can catch one in Portugal this melting thing made me seriously consider the 7900XTX
AMD definitely is more than interesting in this
This whole generation is a massive screw up I might just keep my 3070 for at least another year even though it's not giving me the performance I'm after The 7000 series doesn't give enough of an RT performance upgrade to be worth 1000 and it's simply not an option for the productivity applications I use Meanwhile for the 4000
The pricing of the 7900xtx and xt is amazing glad amd didn't push higher I'm confident the rasterization power of those cards are gonna match whatever Nvidia has coming
They may be still working on the engineering end of the problem At this point they should have some faulty cards adapters in the lab and are trying to reproduce the problem After that they would be working on a fix Once they have a potential fix they have to test that out to make sure it fixes the issue and doesn't itself introduce new problems What's odd is that the reports about whether this was a known issue or not are murky The Corsair PSU expert jonnyguru made an off hand comment a while ago about just replacing melted connectors like it was a common occurrence So did people in the know have advanced warning this could be an issue Unclear
Yes they have the first burnt connector with native atx30 atx 30 connector meltedburnt msi mpg a1000g
Well warranties are with the person who manufactured it If Gigabyte sold the card even if it came with NVIDIAs adapter it's still a Gigabyte issue
I don't think any FE's have had an issue yet NVidia might have a point by blaming partners We just need to know what the exact problem actually is
It's not their standard and it's not their cable their logo is on it but they only provide the specs for the cable to the third parties and they get it manufactured As shitty as it sounds they're correct across the board
It's a per existing standard and certified connector adopted by PCI SIG with the only addition of the sensing pins why people love going around spreading BS Their logo is all over the place on AIB cards
Maybe this is one of the reasons EVGA quit the green team
Probably why EVGA said sorry not us later
I mean tbh I wouldn't overclock any of these new GPUs or processors They all seem so sus I think overclocking anything these days is just gonna cost you a 3k machine so what's the benefit 5fps
Indeed Gigabyte made the card not Nvidia
They didn t ask about a warranty they just told me it s a gigabyte card and I had to talk to gigabyte about it
Well this is unfortunate I guess RMA it is I hope Gigabyte dont give you the workaround
I bought it when it went up on Newegg and then I had to wait a while for my power supply and I come in so I built it about 1 week ago
The 3080 is probably better than a 4070
How does that connector differ from pcie Does it give more power draw and to what amount And would PSU need dedicated EPS connectors
and they have the same amount of power draw 3090ti 4090 So wtf is just happening
Actually all the FE RTX 3000 cards had adapters Here's my FE 3060ti nbsp I'm not sure if it's just a quality difference or if the 12V is just more prone to failure when it's using 500w
Aren t cables rated in current
I ve had this same one and been using it for like three weeks with no problems even checked the plug a few days ago since I ve been following these issues online The failures aren t specific to a card or even adapter it seems someone s native atx 3 0 cable even melted Not saying you shouldn t wait or that the cable mod won t help more just saying that it seems out of your hands Either everything will be fine or it won t and whatever you do might help but nobody has any solid evidence It would be great if someone figured out any rhyme or reason to what s causing these problems because right now it s just Russian roulette with a 1700 gpu
Honestly if I was still in the return period to return mine I d of already done it
PC nerds have the misguided impression they know what they're talking when it comes to hardware because they can piece together the lego build that is a PC But we aren't engineers and shouldn't act like we are That's why I keep repeating to everyone to wait for someone with actual credentials to tell us what is going on here And so far the few people with actual competence who weighed in on the issue like the Galax guy and Jonny Guru all seem to think the connector is fine
I saw a post yesterday I think guy using native psu cable no adapter and it melted It has to be something wrong with the cards
We don't know but i was never arguing that But statistically there should have been at least be ONE case
Agreed MicroCenter protection plan which is through them and not some third party is one of the only ones I ever buy The rest are complete headaches where they make you jump through hoops and if you are lucky all you get is a refurbished similar model device back The MicroCenter one is a flat full refund in the form of store credit which is insane
Interessting this is by law in germany didnt know that this is optional in the US On the other hand you guys dont have to spend at least 2000 Euro for the cheapest 4090 available rn rolling on the floor laughing
I agree it's worth it especially for the monitors thumbs up
If u scroll other post of burned cables you will find people talking about reducing power to 70 through afterburner and some expert explained thst it wont make any difference Thats all i can tell u
Huh
Right now nope unless nvidia says something conclusive then will know what really causing it The best bet u have is either follow what everyone is saying like make sure ur plug is hook in properly without a gap and don t bend the cable too much U can also not use it until nvidia say anything but that s up to u Also don t use those adapters cuz most of the cases involve those adapters from nvidia
Just make sure don't bend at the connection point and make sure it click when you push it in Last but not least get CableMod if you don't trust whatever I wrote lol
the warranty pretty much has to cover this as the cards haven't really shipped with inserts saying to inspect and ensure flush installation of the 12VHPWR thats probably the only failing in this situation
different combinations of hardware throughout the years have had tightness inconsistency that required a little more force occasionally its still user error if there is a visible gap left that could have been identified and mitigated by the user inspecting their job before powering it up
Yep that would be the worst Sadly all I we can really do is speculate on why the patterns show what they show for now This silence is pretty deafening And the bad takes and level of sub toxicity are amplified because of it P
No because there is no inflammable material nearby unless your pc build is very when there is higher intensity due to the melting the psu gets in default mode and lower or cut the current
I guess just make sure you plug it correctly and not bend I ordered from cablemod but you can get it from modiy Also if you use corsair psu buy it from corsair it would be cheaper and only using 2 8pin
Yes you can
Yea this is very scary for sure I am not using mine at the moment It s a literal brick lol
oh you mean those not sure bro its too early to tell we need to wait a month or so for the reports to surface what makes me sad is Nvidia is yet to acknowledge the issue or at least come up with a statement about it and whats even sadder that people are still rushing to buy it knowing that it might melt some day so much for voting with your wallets
Ikr maybe some AIB cheap out on some of the card that s why this is happening either way we gotta way for nvidia to say anything
Too much power over not big enough wires and too few pins Electricity hasn't magically changed
ok crazy
I wonder why we don t have case from the 30 series like this
Did you come to that conclusion all on your own or did some tech tuber tell you who to blame If it was as simple as not plugging the connector in all the way this topic would have been resolved the next day Also means 3090ti owners must just be better at plugging cables in Yes it could cause it but it's not as easy to screw up as you might think There's very little tolerance between the system refusing to run and it being fully seated There are multiple provable factors potentially causing this issue It's what happens when miniaturization of high current connectors meets cost cutting large scale manufacturing with very little margin for error
Yea it would take such a monumental chain of failures to cause a fire from this that it's not really a worry Ok the plastic housing melts and deforms but doesn't light on fire or 't somehow and it just arced and burned there's not much in most people's cases that will genuinely burn out of 's a long chain to get to house burned down
Do you also always turn off you monitor when your PC is unattended because it is a risk of explosion Their recommendations are from abundance of precautions When I say ''virtually 0'' it does not mean ''literally 0'' but for all intents and purpose I dont expect to see a case of someone's house catching fire because of this issue
He wrote virtually 0 if you want literal 0 turn off the main circuit breaker
wtf are you saying man I read all days about this issues and im still running my 4090 with the nvidia adapter I payed 2k for that shit and i want to use it If you can't don't want buy it is your problem I bought it and I WANT TO USE IT SAFE Nvidie shouldn't sell this silent bomb ahead
And by hordes you mean about a dozen people out of 10s of thousands of people
Should have known better What kind of grandma language is that shit
No Copium is helluva drug
They are sold out for my Corsair PSU Didn t even bother looking at other versions Glad you found what you needed thumbs up light skin tone
the gigabyte 4090 oc is one of the top ones as far as being the coolest 4090 so idk what your rambling on about
Here is proof that your statement of gigabyte gpus have been complete shit at cooling vs any other card is false Have a nice day
Well I'm still using the adapter that came with my card Had it since launch checked it when the posts started and looked fine Made sure it was secure and back to using it while I wait for the cablemod replacement to arrive Which for all we know will melt just like all the others
Asking doesn't really help you honestly In one of the other threads there was TWO people posting pics that the thing wasn't fully seated and clicked but swearing they were fully inserted nonetheless People are going to assume they fully inserted it or they wouldn't press on with powering it it doesn't do anything to verify it is the case though
Yes everything worked fine for a week and of course I checked every cable before turning it on
I thought of getting the Gigabyte one but changed my mind to go with Cablemod You don t need to bait me into telling you that I don t have one yet because I don t I strictly referred to 2 cases on the Megathread involving MSI PCIe 5 PSUs
Moddiy is another option for much faster delivery this not a sponsored message I am a satisfied moddiy and cablemod customer
You're talking like recalls never happened in the
At this rate everything is speculation and nothing conclusive really but will know if it s affected the 4080 or not once it comes out And if it doesn t affect the 4080 then tech expert will have something to compare to regarding the issue of the 4090 leading to more data or probably a conclusive answer if nvidia still kept silence
For all we know u might be be safe cuz it doesn t seem to affect everyone but we can t really be certain honestly For now all u can do is make sure ur cables are plug in properly without a gap
I think you should be safe if you have the gen3 pcie 5 msi psu they officially support 40 series and that 1 16 pin cable is giving it all the juice it needs and eliminates any spiking of power
Yeah it's like how the US military did a survey of where their planes get hit after returning to base Over 90 of them were in totally insignificant places like wings or body panels and not engines or rudders If they had hit those spots the plane wouldn't have made it back so it's good they didn't oh
I've been thinking about survivorship bias It exists and it can have a profound distorting effect on conclusions but it doesn't mean you can't learn from studying survivors which is fortunate because sometimes that's all you have access to In essence the problem with survivor bias is that you can't discern when surviving is due to the quality of the survivor or due to the bad luck of the casualties In other words it's harder to say what if any qualities actually improve the chance of success without access to the casualties This is essential knowledge of you're studying survivors in hopes of emulating their success It is however possible to model this to an extent For example the classic example is planes lost in bombing runs They looked at returning planes and reinforced the parts that were hit by shrapnel However they were thinking the wrong way around as the planes returning were the planes lucky enough not to get hit in the critical areas So the right move was reinforcing areas that had no damage on the returning planes But this is actually an example that demonstrates that survivor bias can at least sometimes be effectively countered without acces to the casualties as you can assume shrapnel hits to follow a random distribution and therefore access to survivors access to casualties as the two combined should cover the complete shrapnel distribution Another famous example of survivorship bias is pretty political namely financial succes There's no shortage of people blindly trying to emulate successful people in hopes of similar success On the other extreme side there's people arguing there's little to learn from successful people as they generally just consider them lucky to be born with privilege Even here however you can definitely work your way back around the bias at least to some extent just by studying survivors Qualities that have no bearing on succes are unlikely to be distributed differently in the survivor group vs the general population of course that still implies knowledge of two groups but for many traits a normal distribution can be assumed If for example all people in the survivor group rise early and are productive most of the day regardless of employment status and this is a significantly different distribution compared to the general populace then this trait likely influences success Of course it's still very hard to disentangle confounders but that's not really different if you have access to the casualties For example if all people that rise early have rich parents and that something you can't emulate is the real cause of success However this is not any less confusing even if you do have access to both the survivor and casualty groups It's not the best example anyway because it doesn't rule out a true relation between rising early and success since it remains an open question in this example why all rich parents would raise their children to get up early and there may be a chicken and egg relation there where both instead of one definitely contribute to success I guess I should add a TLDR with my main point Yes survivor bias exists there are good examples and it is very interesting However it is much less clear how to apply that knowledge in practice Is the point that having data on casualties is essential Because that doesn't seem to be the case always even if having more data is usually better than inference
accealy
Jensen has taken the grill pill
No it happed six days after installation up until then it was just fine
They need all the cash they can get before the lawsuits pop up
Well its a fire sale
Also the fact that people keep plugging these things 'm sure
I'm mainly just amazed people are still buying these cards I know it's got to be a very very small percentage of cards that are actually burning connectors but if I was going to spend that much money on a GPU I'd at least wait for the issue to be resolved
People are continuing to buy them so why not xd
Not mind blowing just capitalism
When people cook you can smell something burning from time to time and it s enough to alarm you to check if your PC is okay I had 2 PSUs die on me and I m quite used to being agitated when I smell something burning luckily it s all come from the kitchen over the last 7 years
I basically only played the new modern warfare when I had it on so it lasted about 84 hours
When companies action results in manslaughter they just pay a fine Totally fair
Ford got caught doing it a few times too
Its name was Geforce Partner Program
That should result in criminal negligence charges at the least for the ceo and others beneath them if involved
The problem as well with a bios update It should not affect performance otherwise they could have issues with false performance numbers
This is why I'm in wait 2 years to buy last gen team Especially now when card revisions seems to be a recurring thing can't know what kind of bugs failings or design problems are present It's really disgraceful the consumers have to deal with stuff like this at all You'd think they are marketing us an early access product at this point
As someone who has both 3000nv and 6000amd series unless you doing something Cuda specific Radeon is surprisingly good even on the software side looking at you outdated looking NVIDIA GeForce experience and settings my 1 recommended cheap card is the 6600 bang for the buck if at 210 220 USD range 2070 ish performance in non Ray traced
I got a 6700 XT going from a 1070 great card I've only had issues in one game that being FF XIV and they go away if I set it to run with stock settings rather than the factory overclock it still runs 144 fps anyway
There's no way they don't know what's wrong I can tell you that right now They have multiple example cards and adapters and native cables
Personally i had a bad experience with AMD cards ever since they switched their drivers to Adrenaline in 2020 Their cards are good The software is diabolically bad Make sure you install driver only Also i have a better experience in VR with nvidia cards compared to AMD even though on paper the 2 cards i have right now are on par in terms of performance
BIOS update won't stop existing cards that don't update from catching fire which still leaves them open for litigation
The answer on this case is ohms
600 watts is a bit to much of a draw on such small gage wire
I m right there with you except with a 2080ti 4090 performance is truly impressive and exactly what I need for my resolution and refresh rate as well as a potential future monitor upgrade However the only thing stopping me is the risk of a burnt connector My gamblers luck is terrible and this is one gamble I m going to pass on for the time being
The raster of those cards will not touch the 4090
M I say this hoping they come back in the graphics card game in the next couple of years Their warranty service was top notch
Weeks before the release there was an article on videocardz about a potential thermal issue with the adapter So I assume everyone knew
aw geez that's not a good sign thanks
It s an Nvidia issue since the design of the connector is universal and not a separate 3x8 pin one
I don t believe Nvidia adapters and AIB adapters came from different factories
I have a FE haven t had any melting issues
Probably should have waited more than a few days before deciding that FE's don't melt Or take a stats class
I see this guy is writing BS by days just a troll probably
It s their logo it s their problem
It's absolutely a standard they had a MAJOR part in designing Not sure why people think they just adopted a new standard They even mentioned it themselves and they wanted to have an even less safety margin that the abysmal 15 at 600W of the cable They 1 designed the new standard and 2 push 600W through it at a low safety margin
But Nvidia added the sense pins not PCI SIG right And if I recall correctly 3090 Ti didn t have sense pins and had no melting problems
Don't think these folks are ocing at all As I understand these cards are locked to 600w power limit
Which is correct Gigabyte bundled the adapter It's Gigabyte's job to talk to Nvidia about it not yours
Which is correct your business is between you the retailer and the card brand They didn't push the blame it's not like you spoke directly to the CEO just some rep trying to get through their shift Either return it as defective or go through the warranty process which is with Gigabyte not Nvidia
Well that's exactly what I mean
Did you expect something else
width 3024 format png auto webp v enabled s 49ecbad4ec1d7b77fe692a60b0b2175256fb7f2a When I opened it up these two wires were not connected to anything that I could see is this the problem
So this happened after 1 week before you plugged in your GPU and started playing Thanx for your info plus time and sorry for your loss
How long were you gaming the last night and in general how many hours in one sitting session
Electromechanically they're the same But one was spec'd by Nvidia and the other was spec'd by Intel Since Nvidia established early on that the 8 pin PCIe connector only supports 150W they couldn't go back in time and admit that the connector is actually capable of at least twice as much When Intel spec'd the EPS12V they spec'd it for 235W Even that is conservative as an 18g EPS12V connector's rating per the connector terminal spec sheet is 7A per conductor which is 336W 12V Also daisy chain EPS12V tend not to exist while daisy chain PCIe are quite common So using EPS12V it's not typically possible to put 2x the load on a single cable vs typical pig tail PCIe cables
FIY RTX A6000 already use EPS If people who might jam 8 pin EPS into 8 pin PCIe then they shouldn't build anything by themselves since they might jam 8pin PCIe into CPU EPS anyway I think this wrong plug isn't good counter statement
You shouldn't be able to The shape of the plastic connectors between PCIe and EPS12V are different so this shouldn't be possible Furthermore the 12V and ground are reversed so if you did manage to jam' the wrong connector in short circuit protection should trip immediately
What if it s AIBs not following specs to the letter in building the port And it s the port that s an issue on AIB cards Nvidia had experience building the 3090 Ti FE and then the 4090 AIBs adopted the port for the first time Which again is a very delicate port to begin with
Some 3090 users have been using a 600w bios for years now without any problem at all
Cables are melting even with 300 400W power draws
Yes but cable insulation is rated by voltage
Cables are given a breakdown voltage level that they can safely carry voltwise before it's enough to jump the dielectric They're rated in amps for their actual use level but will ALWAYS have a voltage rating for the insulator
Steve Burke at GamersNexus has now discovered that while the cables themselves are the issue it is not all cables that can lead to the burning or melting of the card The tech outlet spotted that all of their cables were labeled as 300V 14AWG while the ones that were shown by Igor's were rated at 150V That's a vast difference But not just that there was also a difference in the solder between the two cables
I am merely looking at cable rating to understand which version was affected here
True I ve been wondering if these issues have been affecting cards from release day or if it s a different batch Like you said though I ll probably start using it soon and hope for the best I ll keep an extinguisher near by though lol
Hm That doesn't sound right at all 70 of 8 3A per pin is 5 8A I think that's less than pcie4s current limit
Now thats stupid Its like selling a gun and then ending up being responsible of someone shooting himself with it because you didnt warn him that blasting your self with a 12 gauge is going to end badly
And how many of those different hardware configurations with inconsistent tolerances resulted in a potential fire hazard risk due to user error Usually the hardware will either not work or have some kind of indicator that there isn't sufficient power going through due to improper seating There's a reason most companies try to make their products foolproof no offense to the people who bought 4090s Edit Just to clarify I do agree with you that it is user error that's causing these melting connectors but I'm saying that it's user error due to a design flaw
The more I think about it the more certain I am this is a connector defect on cards from at least these 3 companies Asus MSI Gigabyte As people have pointed out we haven't seen failures yet on other brands like Palit PNY etc This is the simplest explanation for why good native cables with ATX 3 0 PSUs have also melted With the same companies The question is are these the exceptions or the rule Two very different scenarios depending on the answer
Curtains carpet the desk if it's wood I'm literally an engineer if the owner doesn't notice they can cause fires
Acrylic if flammable
I'm using a cheap amazon adapter and stopped worrying about it I have a warranty anyways I'm not using the nvidia adapter anymore so chances are I'm fine
Just plugggg and lol
Yeah appears to be it s a bit hard to blame on Nvidia since there has been no FE cards melting yet could actually be some circuit design flaws that s actually putting too much pressure on a few specific pins idk I will probably skip this generation hahaha
LOL
Are you fucked do you understand how current and electricity work It s fucking build up resistance how do you get that By not seating the connector There s literally no other way People are fucking idiots dude lol you ll prob say next it s arcing literally impossible for it to inside there impossible It s melting due to resistance and nothing more from it not being seated Lol it s why only 0 02 have this issue and it s the exact same issue Main cause people are fucking brain dead
adapter I paid 2k for FTFY Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didn't help you it is only correct in Nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant The deck is yet to be payed Payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them The rope is payed out You can pull now Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment Beep boop I'm a bot
You're right Most people who have the card know better They've went back to their older cards as I've seen many here and on PCMasterRace say they've done Because they saw the signs and who in their right mind would continue to use a 1 500 GPU that has a high risk of burning up It's like being told your car model has a high risk of the brakes failing and continuing to drive it anyways It's idiotic
We aren't sold out we're still taking in orders for all products Simply put we're making most products to order since the demand is too high to keep any inventory hence the longer wait for shipping But you can order your cable and expect it to ship in around two weeks
He's rambling because Gigabyte hurt him in some way Better just to ignore those types
I dont have the 4090 I meant all their earlier releases The 20 and 30 series
I dont have the 4090 I meant all their earlier releases
The way I see it is to not use the 4090 at all until Nvidia makes a statement or a decision on what's going on If you're going to risk using the card then do whatever you can with what is known so far to reduce the risk or chances on your cable melting which is still not 100 full proof You're also right it can still happen with CableMod
Bait you lol I was asking little guy I mentioned getting the new PSU and you said you had one I was referencing the pcie 5 PSU when I said new
So the new cards are being recalled this is news
yup i made sure it s clicked into place hopefully they address the issue soon
tl dr
It's accio not accealy Hermione probably
I mean you may not even be safe with an actual atx 3 0 PSU and its native connectors Saw a post on several pc related subreddits where they had a burnt connector not using the adapter
The word may have gotten out by now to most people purchasing a 4090 but the fact remains Nvidia and its partners have said nothing about not using the supplied adapters I'm just waiting for my recall refund notice to come from Gigabyte about my 4090 OC card I registered my card and will be playing with the ONLY supplied adapter and see what happens
And paying over 2grand at that
Is it just the adapters causing problem or are normal 16 pin connecters from power supplies also doing it If its just their adapter then damn they are gonna get sued to hard when this shit eventually catches on fire by someone not paying attention
Most people don't know there are issues Not everyone who buys a gpu goes ti reddit first before buying it
Oh yeah I was just joking a bit hahah When it smokes real bad it usually smells like absolute shit because of the polymers breaking down
Which sadly may cost less than a recall or they just play the game and hope thry can get away with it
We desperately need fines to scale A parking ticket can wreck someone paycheck to paycheck but corporate fines are usually the cost of doing business I hate how eye for an eye this gets but I also think that especially when the consequences can t be solved by money alone severe pollution etc that we need to start seeing legal consequences for executives The current system just promotes a boss or executive to pass unethical orders down the line I d imagine that if problems occurred and consequences traveled back up the line and resulted in C suites going to jail we d never see shit like this again Corporate executives rightfully going to jail not necessarily over this but in general feels like as much of a pipe dream as expecting a letter from Hogwarts sadly
The for pinto comes to mind Where ford literally decided it was cheaper to let folks burn to death then to recall 's fuel tank was the result of both conservative industry practice of the time as well as the uncertain regulatory environment during the development and early sales periods of the car Ford was accused of knowing the car had an unsafe tank placement and then forgoing design changes based on an internal cost benefit analysis Two landmark legal cases Grimshaw v Ford Motor Co and Indiana v Ford Motor Co resulted from fatal accidents involving Pintos 59
Oh you can bet your ass it'll affect performance I would imagine the easiest possible solution is to limit the power of the card to bring down the current in the 6 wire pairs Not sure if that would solve the whole issue but it's a good start And the other problem is how they would ensure everyone did the update There are probably some pretty heated pun meetings going on inside of Nvidia Ones that include the C suite folks as well as their legal team What a cluster fuck
My 4090 is fine
looking at you outdated looking NVIDIA GeForce experience and settings I think you mean NV control panel cus GFE is far from outdated looking Regardless as much as the NVCP looks outdated it is highly functional and has a far better track record than whatever AMD is calling their software stack this week Plus you can choose to install GFE on top or not and get all the features AMD has in their driver mostly better done and more AMD is certainly useable though for the moment but generally people aren't looking for passable they're looking for the best option
It's a complex system involving a hugely complex core IC multiple VRMs on the board tons of different PSUs maybe the motherboard and various levels of software firmware BIOS driver OS application It's possible the issue isn't a single component but a rare problematic interaction of multiple levels of the design You don't unravel stuff like that overnight And even after they've root caused the issue they have to figure out a fix make sure the fix works and doesn't cause other issues and make sure the fix works for the reference and all partner boards
Did an AMD card ever melt anything in your PC If not I d say they re currently ahead
Over it's lifetime the 7900xtx still could output more frames since not burning down
They really flew to close to the sun on this 's rated for about 660w In a perfect condition That is not alot of head room for things to go wrong
Yes but the design issue would be between Gigabyte and NVIDIA The product breaking is between OP and the person who sold it
I believe that there are at least three different kinds of adapters maybe NVidia kept all the good ones or maybe it's actually the AIB cards and not the adapters It's possible that it's not NVidia's fault because their cards don't fail
But if it's not the adaptor but the port
That isn't really what was being implied If FE cards with the same similar adapters have no problems then it could be a problem with AIB models themselves which Nvidia would be right to shift the blame onto them for
Based on what your own feeling
Yeah i mean 99 of the partner ones too The question is the aggregates
What part of might and We just don't know do you not understand Sounds like you might want to take an English class but my guess is that you're just stupid
Not how it works buddy
But it isn't THEIR standard It's pci sig and molex whom multiple big companies are a part of The spec from molex denotes up to 792w across this connector So it's simply not the spec
Sense pins actually part of the PCI SIG standard Anyway I don't see how they could be the sense pin to cause the problem the most probable cause is a batch of bad terminals on the card or cable and user error
One of the charts Gamers Nexus showed them getting 666w with the FE Changing voltages without knowing what you're doing can def exceed 600w You can command 130 power target in software alone Each vga 8pin is 150w plus 75w from the pcie slot on the board is 675w
You're correct People are stupid Nvidia bad AMD good mkay
Mine is also that So far they are not meant to do anything My aftermarket adapter only has 2 wires on the 4 pin Thats not the cause of the melting For sure tho i know if you clean up the plug on the gpu and use a different adapter it will still work I take a look at the gpu plug and it seems it just had leftover plastic from the adapter But hopefully gigabyte will just do the RMA without a hassle Or even better if you can just return the gpu to the retailer that you bought it from and get your money back
last night it was probably 6 7 hours of modern warfare but the highest temp I ve actually seen is 67 F
are those FE cards because that bios is locked down i recall i know the aib used regular 8 pin connects like the evga ftw3 3090 but i believe the 3090ti use the new newish connector
Correct The insulation is rated in voltage The wires used makes no difference Nor does the fact that the wires are soldered to a PCB The problem is the connector
Then why does it matter what insulation the wires use The problem isn't the insulation And the voltage in the conductor is nowhere near the breakdown voltage
I know I was being facetious
This has been debunked by now to be the issue
hey people need floor is slippery when wet
There is no fire risk here nothing in a pc can catch fire melt and smell bad yes but never burn to the ground
I'm an engineer too and in the pc case i don't see what could feed the fire So there is no chance it propagates outside the case in the first hand What you seem to forget is the melting which may provoke a short circuit will also triggers the sefety mechanisms of the psu leading no few or no intensity supplied then no enough energy to start the said fire
Good call
Or u can get amd they seem to be a lot cheaper
Take a breath and think about what you just said Yes increased resistance is the problem and affects load balancing across all 6 pins However do you really think not plugging the connector in another mm or so is the only practical way to see increased resistance and heat buildup in a terminal connection and no arc discharge is not going to happen with 12V under 10A Electrical sparking due to intermittent contact of conductors could absolutely happen but any tiny arcs created upon seperation aren't sustainable I doubt most of this is the issue anyway unless severe damage has occurred
or yknow u could just set a power limit until there's a better solution
Not available to order The only option is to be put on a waitlist This is for the US store
I meant all the ones that agree with what I say not the ones that disagree
If nvidia makes a statement it likely won't be any time soon and if they do I doubt they will accept fault for the current situation Should the adapter melt I'll accept their FE replacement for my gaming trio as it is likely the better card overall Otherwise I rather just use my computer then wait around hoping for an answer that likely isn't coming
Don t assume my age based on the words I chose to express my thought Usually these kinda questions end up at Well you have no new PSU so shut up about telling people you don t need them Anyway I confirm I don t have the new PSU
You must attend the entirety of their Ted Talk no summaries allowed
Same boat as you Running fine so far but I have a feeling this will get recalled Good thing I registered for that 4 year warranty with G
Yup I was day one on the 3090 FE when it first came out and I'm just thankful there were no issues
Pretty sure theres be reports of native 16 pin cables melting as well
If u are buying 2k card u prob read abaut IT news and stuff
It didn t smoke and the air intake I was feeling was cool
Consumer protection law agencies wont be happy tho If you payed for an advertised performance you should get it They might open themselves for lawsuits either way
It would solve the whole issue The problem is too much current hitting a resistance which causes excessive heat and burning This is basic electricity you learn in beginners courses Nvidia knew this but the pushed obviously so hard against the limit today they ignored that tell life always needs safety tolerances
They tested pulling continuous 1500 W from the adapter
Why would it affect performance The issue isn't power consumption Do you think everyone is pushing 600 watts Or even 450 on avg
Had an AMD card and nvidia for 10 years I run two rigs I think you need to let the driver shit go from a decade ago AMD has been fine as well as Nvidia except for a few outliers that either side has
My 3070 is currently ahead I am skipping this gen and the next probably Since all i play works great i am not planning on an upgrade anytime soon
LMAO
Had it been limited to just Gigabyte no problem but it s Asus and MSI involved as well
They do approve AIB spec so in any case nvidia is to blame
Then we are royally fucked
On how these adapters look first and foremost they all have Nvidia logo and design with soldering variances
Ifs and buts and speculation based on nothing
I think sense pins are actually the thing that doesn t allow for a smooth insertion and leads to overheating if we go down the route of user error
Transient spikes do not count as overclocking Nor can you control them with software You literally can not raise the power limit to 666W without it being a spike or reflashing the bios you have no idea what you are talking about
Do you mean 67 celsius 67F is colder than most ambient rooms will be in a house
I think the problem will be the connectors on a few company's cards And longer full load sessions more than 1 2 hrs will increase the odds of a burnout What we don't know is if this affects all cards defect in design due to EVGA reasons or a few due to defect in manufacturing process
That sounds like a you problem
It's a quick way to identify which wiring they used as so far they're finding adapters with varying wiring types The wiring doesn't have part numbers on it only the current voltage breakdown and gauge values So the only thing that varies from the one type to the other is the voltage breakdown value By asking that he's basically saying is it wire x or y but I don't think the wiring type matters in this situation at all so it's a red herring imo It's obviously nowhere near the breakdown voltage as it's a 12V regulated line If anything it's likely under 12V as you're likely to see a voltage drop as the line resistance goes up at the DUT
But I didn't reply to you Lol I assumed you were joking but some people might really not get how these things are done
Trolls will be trolls
AdministrativeAd9591 4 hr ago Jesus this is bad Was this from a 150 or 300v cable Send this back for rma Ok well that guy is sitting at 27 karma which I am replying to meanwhile y'all put me to 1 for simply giving a source
True that
A power limit won't help you if your setup bends the cable too much Physical disconnection of the contacts inside the adapter can also cause it to burn up At least thats what early investigations pointed to We need to hear what Nvidia deduces is the issue and what they plan to do to fix it But hey until then if you decide to take the risk on your card go ahead I just find it hilarious that people still post pictures of their burnt cards and adapters acting all surprised that it happened to them WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
Aaah yeah US Store is a different story we haven't supplied it yet It will hopefully happen soon
lol k
I ve been using mine since 10 15 and I feel like at this point we might be okay maybe not but I m not too worried about it since I ve probably got 40 hrs of heavy load gaming on it and it still looks perfect I ll get my Cablemod next week and hopefully I can just move on after that
You have some issues you need to sort out mentally I think Your melted cable couldn t have happened to a nicer person I was asking a GENUINE QUESTION and you got all bent out of shape
Saw one but that was just one
If you paid for an FTFY Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didn't help you it is only correct in Nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant The deck is yet to be payed Payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them The rope is payed out You can pull now Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment Beep boop I'm a bot
Oh there'll be lawsuits At a minimum they'll be sued by shareholders for just fucking up and dropping the stock price
That s not the issue at all Someone posted a video on YouTube putting more than 1000W through the connector and it was completely fine
On one card with one adapter It's obviously not happening with every card So there's a combination of circumstances that causes the problem which may also include manufacturing defects variations One test on one sample does not mean that the case is closed for a particular possible issue
There have been melted plugs for cards running at 450W stock So it's not a problem isolated to people running 600W Maybe there's some issue that causes the card to spike current draw at 2x max rated power for a short time So to make a card safe it needs to run at 225W spiking to 450W on average Hence a performance hit
A decade plus Are you fucking nuts RX 5000's massive driver woes were very recent Sure as shit weren't an outlier AMD is also causing fairly substantial annoyance currently due to their recent attempt to improve their OGL driver which has completely nuked 90 of Minecraft shaders past driver version 22 6 1 as well as many other OGL based programs Lying for your favorite GPU company helps no one in the long run
That doesn't involve OP that would still be between the manufacturers and NVIDIA OPs situation is still between them and Gigabyte if they want a resolution
What does that have to do with anything If you bought a Gigabyte card then your warranty isn't with Nvidia What's so difficult about that
From a consumer perspective that s completely irrelevant It s a Gigabyte product so the responsibility lies with Gigabyte or even more likely with whoever sold it to you Gigabyte might recoup their cost by demanding money from Nvidia but that s not your problem as a consumer
Exactly they approve specs but they cant be blamed if a board partner does not follow them Anyhow I m just being tongue in cheek here I think only time will tell wtf is going on
Maybe AIB makers didn't follow the spec for the port or have some weak VRMs
And the how the logo on the connector is a solid prove if there is one thing that is sure is that the manufacturer of the connectors doesn't manufacture the adapter not to mention the connectors could have been bought with a bulk order by NVIDIA to be shipped by the manufacturer directly to AIB There are also different looking adapters and variant in the adapters cables to terminals assembly actually likely point to different manufacturers
Then why even reply a month later You need to learn how to critically think or you will alway be the failure that you are
All of these 12vhpwr connectors that are supplied by the manufacturers are conversion cables that put 4 8pin cables into this one connector Not lost
Correction 3x8 pins melted too Another take would be drop sense pins
Because Steve Burke is a bad journalist not an investigative engineer Quote him and you're just as worthy as he is
i dont think anyones acting surprised isnt it good that they are adding the documentatiob to the volume of connector issues makes it harder for nvidia to ignore not that they are but still
Sorry it s 2 am here and I m on a shitter too tough to remain in shape If you have anything else to contribute to my genuine answer in my comment above please feel free to comment instead of lecturing me on psychology
Good bot
The owners of the company are going to sue themselves
Question is how long for and in which environment heat ramps up over time and probably in pc case like conditions gets stuck near the
You can't draw constant power with a graphics card let alone 1500W Many other tried to reproduce the problem and they have all failed Could be some defective adapter sure that is obvious it happen any component including the 8pin connector as it could happen because owners didn't fully inserted the connector which is exactly what a relative high number of people did judging by the comments like omg I just checked mine and when I pushed it made a click
Power usage is COMPLETELY out of the equation I love that you downvoted me though If it was power usage we'd see very specific failure modes related to people cranking power We even have failure from someone just playing wow at 'd have WAY more failures
In this particular case yes the appeal has to be submitted to Gigabyte it s just pathetic for Nvidia to not even try to acknowledge the problem
Your warranty is with Gigabyte but the core problem is the new forced standard of the connector developed and supplied by Nvidia The connector melts across brands and is not limited to just one brand Of course if yours melts you ll go to your initial vendor but to tell that Nvidia doesn t have anything to do with melting connectors is pretty stupid
This is understandable but remember how POSCAP saga ended with just one driver update
This theory will only come to practical fruition if basically every native cable of cablemod cable will melt on AIB cards
Then Nvidia has to make a statement that they ordered it from different vendors if that is the root problem By now we know nothing as to whether the issue is with the actual quality and soldering of the adapters It s only Igor s Lab who pedaled this aspect
To let you know what a waste of space you are of course Have a better day sweetheart
1 There are 3 x 8 pin adapters for 4090 s that are shipped with some cards 2 The max power is measured on card and limited by card bios 600W is the max I ve seen and that is not common Changing the voltage doesn t affect this hard coded limit The only way around it is physically modifying the card or modifying the BIOS limit by flashing a modified BIOS Transient power consumption is not the same as sustained power consumption
Google anything and you'll find reports of it D
oh i see so if i just say the 150v 300v thing is a known thing it's ok as long as i don't quote it read this whole comment chain again and notice how my only interaction was giving a source to the claim that no one had disputed
Shareholder lawsuits brought against the company directors for mismanagement are very common
It s not that simple s possible that the whole thing is just caused by user error not plugging it in all the way since it very difficult to push in
perhaps the other events like other benchmarks games pushed it to the edge which started the process and made everything weak enough that even games like WoW will just trigger the smoke signals
the core problem is the new forced standard of the connector developed and supplied by Nvidia Developed by Intel actually NVIDIA just followed the ATX 3 0 standard The connector melts across brands and is not limited to just one brand Of course if yours melts you ll go to your initial vendor but to tell that Nvidia doesn t have anything to do with melting connectors is pretty stupid But notably there have been no reports of the adapters melting on the FE editions of the cards All of the melted cards are board partners so maybe there's something there Now this is just speculation on my part but we know that the board partners have trouble making profits see EVGA so maybe they are cutting corners in one of the worst places to cut corners
but to tell that Nvidia doesn t have anything to do with melting connectors is pretty stupid Did anybody say that Only called out your pathetic meltdown which isn't helping anybody and is at worst misleading when people start calling Nvidia support for no good reason Pissing off Nvidia partners like calling Gigabyte support is the right call because Nvidia can't ignore when Gigabyte starts calling
I've never even heard of a 3 x 8 pin adaptor Which cards do they ship with I've watched nearly every review on YouTube and own a 4090 and this is the first I've ever heard of a 3 x 8 pin adaptor This is clearly news to me Here's a screenshot from one of gamers Nexus' videos showing the power draw they got out of the FE card with a 33 overclock
Stop spreading misinformation asshole The insulation rating is irrelevant to this problem
This just cemented the 3060 ti as my last Nvidia GPU
Feels like he is talking to Nvidia's investors and not buyers Also numbers will speak for themselves If 40 series card still sell well like hot cakes of course Nvidia will still keep their ridiculous price points But if more people are turning to the older 20 and 30 series cards due to price or switch team Red then they may just promote the RTX 4080 12GB version in cheaper form factors
like the mid tier 899 4080 Remember when 699 was the top tier enthusiasy card you could buy and most people bought 250 299 cards
The idea that I'm going to buy an Nvidia GPU again unfortunately is a story of the past
But you rebranded the 4070 as a 4080 and then charged double thinking face
It honestly just feels like they priced the 4000 series high so that people would buy 3000 series instead at a cheaper price They make some money from early adopters but also sell excess 3000 stock I mean it s not the silliest idea
Why do I dislike this man more every time he opens his mouth
The current economic model is not sustainable Every single public company expect infinite growth from a finite population It doesn't matter if they make money they have to make X more money than last year This problem isn't just limited to NVIDIA Until something changes mega corps will keep scalping people
Sure Jensen sure In that case I should spend a monthly salary on your overpriced GPU that I don't really need These guys are just living in an alternate universe or what
supply and demand If no one buys the 4000 series then the prices come down
This gen is a full skip for me
Looks like Jensen has decided to take a page out of Don Mattrick's playbook Fortunately we already have products for people who don't want to pay such high prices It's called the 3000 series Jensen Huang probably
Bro just accepting the Villian arc Ya hate to see it
Jensen the idea of me buying one of your cards is also unfortunately a story of the
The idea that I'll support Nvidia any time in the near future is a story of the past
I m really starting to sour on NVDA and Jensen Riding a little too high on the horse as of late
We will see when AMD annouces their prices
He's not happy with N4 wafer pricing lel
sure jen
People talking about AMD as if they won t price their shit relatively similar
Pending what AMD come out with gpus have hit a road block that they haven t solved yet Proper high fps 4k gaming without fake frames As a 3080 owner I don t see a need to upgrade until that becomes a reality I m already better off than a PS5 and Xbox so games are always going to perform better than the bare minimum and frankly it isn t like graphics are bad That s shown by the focus on fps rather than deep graphical detail we re at a point we need higher memory and processing power and we re seeing that s not easy anymore under Moore s law
Papa Jensen is so right consumers have had it too good for too long Small companies like Nvidia operate on razor thin margins They're basically a charity at this point They have done so much for us gamers and they deserve to be paid appropriately for their amazing products
We understand Jensen those leather jackets are getting expensive and you gotta pay for them somehow
We know chip prices went up this gen TSMC forced you to pay for your Samsung adventure But that is not a reason to sell 4070 as a 4080 Also there is a thing called raising the price too much But hey market forces will sort it out Cards that do not sell get discounted Now we know why EVGA bailed
Now that the mining market has collapsed Nvidia will create an artificial shortage by withholding 40 series cards and selling 30 series for inflated prices to desperate gamers who need an upgrade
GPU chips won't be getting cheap anymore thereby making PC gaming more costly Therefore you should subscribe to our cloud gaming solution at just 10 month and enjoy You will own nothing and you will be happy smiling face with horns
Nvidia Stock Go doooown
It's the same exact thing they did with the 20xx series and prices Not surprised at all
Just wait and see when no one is buying he'll change his tune fast
Think I ll hold onto my very capable 3070ti for a couple more years
I'll live in the past then
Bullshit Processes always improve and cheapen We aren't at the end of technological improvement You can't just say this shit because TSMC is bending you over a barrel Loser
Except it literally does go down in every way A 1080 retailed at 599 MSRP A 2070 retailed at 499 MSRP Not only was the 2070 cheaper but it also provided higher frame rates in most games A 2080 retailed at 699 MSRP A 3070 retailed at 499 MSRP Once again Not only was the 3070 cheaper but it also provided higher frame rates in most games But all of a sudden gains now must go hand in hand with a price increase this is just something Nvidia is telling themselves to justify screwing over the consumer I call Bull
Greedy bastard
Back to the consoles everyone lol
The idea that people will keep building more and more expensive PCs which also become more and more expensive in electricity usage unfortunately is a story of the past We have been 'flowers for Algernon'd by better and better graphics for games but I truly think that the future is in optimising the gameplay of games itself instead of the graphics Many indie games or high graphics are not necessary Just for reference The Commodore 64 could only play games that are bad by modern standard but it used up to 30 Watt to do so The xbox 360 would draw about 170 Watt for most gaming and could play games like Skyrim at an enjoyable level the xbox series x uses a similar amount for most games Finally a Switch is around 300 and 20 Watt to play games the Steam deck is 400 but with a similar power budget But on the NVIDIA side even while the decreasing size of chips should have made them more power efficient you need more and more power to play the popular games of any time The 4090 will apparently draw up to 450 W and costs 1600 Is gaming with the RTX 4090 really more than 5 times as good as gaming on the Switch or more than 4 times compared to a Deck Or even more considering you also need a CPU etc to turn the GPU into a gaming PC This cannot continue PS I don't have a Switch because f'ck Nintendo but I also have a 2015 GPU so honestly the Steam Deck is starting to look very attractive
SOB needs a new yacht to match his trademarked leather jacket LOL
Not only is proce going up but power consumption too its time to refocus on whats important
That s only because during Covid and people worked from home and gaming as a whole erupted for something to do he saw what true gamers are willing to pay What he is NOT factoring in is that most of the scalper purchases were aided buy bonus money of 1600 a month That s all done and now job losses are skyrocketing cost of living is skyrocketing and those jobs still going on did not see a pay increase Perhaps it s a break even Produce fewer and sell to the upper middle class and wealthy only
That s BS Cause now we know about what that 3090 ti FE cost to make with the recent markdowns Yo re still going to make something on them and not sell at a loss And with the rumor that he decided to mark up the price 100 of the 4090 last min tells me that it cost the same as the 3090 ti So take your 150 160 markup and stick it up your ass Manufacturing costs the same you could cut it to 130 markup and have it at 1200 1300 which is fair But nope I hope more partners drop out taking away Nvidia s leverage and really force them to think about their practices over the last decade
Sorry dude but my income hasnt kept up with your
Unfortunately your profits may go down too until you suddenly find out you can go down
If nobody buys them they'll go down in price
r famouslastwords Seriously though I very much feel like the GPU market has peaked and Nvidia is about to get hit HARD
Mark my words These cards they announced will be going for half their listed prices within a year Nvidia is about to feel the pain in a very real way and I think they know that They are just trying to cash in as much as possible while some still have not realized the rules have changed It is all a game he is playing hoping there are some that still have not caught on
I really hope his greed comes back and bites them in the ass AMD should take advantage of this extremely unique situation I'll for sure swap back to AMD ATI if it performs even decently well
Well Jensen you and your company can just go fuck yourselves
the idea that we're going to overproduce GPUs again unfortunately is a story of the past Gotta love manufactured scarcity
I might get downvoted for taking Jensen's side here but he's not wrong Notice that he says chips not graphics cards He's referring to their supplier TSMC which actually makes NVIDIA's chips TSMC has significantly increased prices of their wafers recently and they removed volume discounts It doesn't help that NVIDIA stabbed TSMC in the back by going to Samsung and trying to use this move to force TSMC to lower prices spoiler they didn't TSMC has becoming so dominant now that Jensen is 100 correct in stating that prices are only going to go up There's basically nobody else competing with them Samsung is the closest thing but they are still behind Intel has potential but they are just stumbling constantly and I doubt they'll make their own GPU's anytime soon their current GPU's are also TSMC made Should tensions rise between China and Taiwan it's going to be a nightmare
From now on I'll be buying a generation or two behind
Feels weird to me that no one is talking about the lack of games this year What are people even meant to play on these monster GPUs I brought a 3090 2 years ago to play cyberpunk I don t even know what game they will bundle with it probably CoD
Just going to have a repeat of the early 00s Consoles are going to be a better value and these cards arent going to sell and another company will come in and eat their lunch Nvidia is getting too cocky because of the pandemic and crypto market that their shit was overpriced
Blah blah blah we know we are being manipulated We get inflation We also get manipulating a market because of greed You ain't fooling anybody there buddy
Disguise the RTX 4070 as an RTX 4080 to deceive the consumers and make them pay 900 for a mid range card check Make the RTX 4080 70 more expensive 100 in Europe than the previous generation card check Make DLSS 3 0 exclusive to the RTX 4000 and screw people who paid hard money to get an RTX 3000 check Way to go Nvidia
Then me buying their products is a thing of the past
we all knew this was coming to say im surprised would be a lie this is why brand loyalty is never a good thing as consumers
Me sitting here looking at temps and power draw of these gpus like eh they're probably gonna catch fire anyway
You can buy a car for less
The reason why prices are this high is because people have been willing to pay extortionate prices for the last
Nvidia is now turning into the scalpers Love their gpus but they re now a dirtbag company Especially with their 4080 12gb that s really a 4070 with a xx80 price tag I ll gladly pick up a used one after a year for half the price Or maybe even a 3090 in a few months Keep on scumming Nvidia
That just means chips gotten worse To increase performance they will just stack them on top of each other instead of developing better tech See those new cards that are too big and pretty much require their own power supply Those are no longer what people need People need affordable GPUs even those 20 series would be good to be still produced en masse That is what we need Not those too expensive gpus most won't buy
Did the fucker get high grinding his gpus and sniffing it through his rectum
Will we ever get a 200 card that decisively beats the GTX 1070 from 2016 Even the 250 RTX 3050 loses in some
This CEO is just as bad as Intels CEO now Nvidia might have a great product but this guy is out of touch with reality Cost of Living markups will account for product increase as well as material price hikes TMSC's uptick but once things settle back down Remember DDR3 costs due to price fixing things will return to a normal ish price point Its no different for Nvidia here He will end up dying on this hill by making this promise to the share holders and investors because now that expectation is on the table As time moves on he will be held accountable for when price drops have to happen
I have said time and time again that the idea that PC gaming was dying was overblown and 't save us They will just price their products 50 75 dollars lower than Nvidia and we will call them heroes They are looking for developers they are looking at designers We will be stuck with insanely overpriced shit cards
Suck on my Huang Mr Jensen
He's basically telling people to not wait for the prices to go down but to buy them for full price fuck him and his greedy and scummy business practices
This asshole just shot himself in both feet
The idea of buying a new GPU every year is also a story of the past for most people Those 2080 and 3080 cards are still solid
blame wallstreet for this public companies like nvidia are always under the pressure for more revenue more profit and jensen's entire fortune is based on the stock value of the company
That's fine I'm sure my 1080 can go another decade And if it can't I saw someone selling a 1080 ti for 200 bucks the other day
Unfortunately
Never owned an AMD card there is a first time for everything I guess waving hand I was fucking waiting 4xxx gen to update my setup because of the 3xxx fiasco but they fucked it up again face with rolling eyes
Team red anyone
BS Don t sell us a 1k gpu that's really a 600
He's pretty confident that we'll pay 900 for their fake 4080s lol
The idea that I won't buy Nvidia over time fortunately is a story of the future
This is how Nvidia becomes unfortunately a story of the past
This translate into we gave up on innovation and have moved onto stagnation with price increase with zero to marginal improvements Everyone should be more upset that they have purposely not released the 4070 4060 lower end cards yes the 12GB 4080 is messed up too Because there are to many 3070 and 3060 If they released would have to drop price Considering Nvidia made a shit ton during the chip shortage they had no issues selling cards to all those mining rigs They want us to feel sorry for them because the 2nd hand market has messed up their 4000 series release plans Honestly not holding my breath but I wish AMD comes out swinging for the fences and says fuck it undercut every Nvidia card by 150 200 This would really fuck Nvidia over more than AMD
Graphics card prices go up Nvidia stock goes down
An xbox ps5 cost 500 A 4080 is not 3x the graphic fidelity of these systems Kick rocks
Scummy company thought I missed out by buying amd now I don t really care
No you're taking advantage of the international shipping issues because you're a piece of shit
Now I really hope Nvidia making profit off these cards is a story of the past as well I really do wish they suffer for once and learn not to screw their consumers
value to price was one of the reasons why people choose PC gaming over consoles but seemingly not anymore I think this might harm the scene and pc market in general
Nvida is behaving like Apple entitled snobs drunk on success CUDA tech needs a very real competitor Clearly Jensen doesn't give a shit about gamers CUDA tech having competition would attack Nvida's monopoly in the production industry
F ck you Nvidia and f uck you J 've been milking gamers for 20 years Each generation more expensive than previous I hope you fall Jensen and fall so bad that you can afford new leather jacket What i can't imagine is a single component costing more than the rest of the PC together Those other components have chips too and no one isn't so greedy like you greedy green bast rds Never gonna buy nvidia card again
This is how you kill PC gaming I m a life long since the 80s PC gamer but this is getting ridiculous When I can play 90 of the same games on my Xbox Series X I m not in a huge rush to spend 3k building a new PC
Sure buddy sure Good luck with that Nvidia lol
Pc gaming has become such an expensive hobby I m gonna stick with my current build for multiplayer 1080p 144fps gaming and just use my ps5 for the big single player titles that way I don t have to upgrade my pc for a very long time
I can't help but wonder in comparison with many pay to win games At a certain point the 'main' group becomes the whales as such the game has no reason to market towards anyone else this almost feels like it could happen here with growing inequality in the world
Yeah ok Me buying a GPU every 2 years is unfortunately a story of the past then too I have more than enough discretionary income to buy multiple 40xx series and not notice but the value isn't there anymore 500 800 on a component great whatever Won't even think about spending that much 1 500 That's gonna be a no I'm not paying 62 something a month for my gaming hobby
The idea that technology will improve over time is a thing of the past Ok bro cook that up in your kitchen too If this was true he would have never said
Come on AMD prove them wrong
BOYCOTTNVIDIAPRICES
I would have loved to see him doing airquotes while saying 'unfortunately'
Dude needs to fire himself or the marketing team needs to fire they've been fucking going down since integrated circuits were invented
You're a fucking story of the past Jensen You fucking leather wearing dominatrix fuck
lol Jensen is such a douche
Of course he's lying Putting people's gut reactions aside for a moment he knows that the more consumers are uninformed about unconventional computing paradigms the more companies like NVIDIA can wring them dry for measly gains in performance I run the r ReversibleComputing subreddit and I used to ask myself why established players like NVIDIA wouldn't invest heavily into much better paradigms photonic near memory reversible It appears that they've found a better way to protect their revenue long term keep lying to the consumers about Moore's law and hope that they stay too uneducated about the true potential of GPUs to pressure their R D department Just so you know the current generation of GPUs is almost eight 08 orders of magnitude yes that's a hundred millions less energy efficient FLOPS Watt than it should be had they not slept on research and development As long as performance enthusiasts stay uneducated about what can really be done to improve the hardware they're gonna keep paying a premium for crappy upgrades Your myopia always had a cost You're only realizing it now
At TSMC Nvidia gets the short end of the stick Jensen is probably not happy that he has to deal with a company much bigger and much more important than Nvidia
Amd is catching up with performance and tools gpu wise Nvidia may become irrelevant after 5 10years if they go this way
That ain't no heatpipe jensen is sucking on
Got a 3090 during the crypto highs Ain't replacing for at least another couple of years
Assuming what he is saying is true it doesn't change the fact that these prices are just too damn high So if we've hit peak gaming performance for the next 5 10 years so be it The cost of making games is way up to so the market would probably benefit from a more stable slower moving ecosystem
I jumped from 980ti to 3090 4000 series is marketed as being 2x faster than 3000 but my card isn t close to being maxed out
The idea that Jensen will come to his senses is a thing of the past
I m lucky enough to be able to buy stuff like the 4090 and I still won t be doing it They need to come back down to reality This isn t the height of the mining boom gamers won t pay these prices when something like the 30 series can be found everywhere for a deep discount
I'll still be buying one Eventually Except this time I won't be buying one until probably a few years from now I'm satisfied with my 3070 and even 1080ti builds still Gone are the days where I would just day one upgrade and sell the old card I don't need to have the latest and greatest anymore There's no games out there worth the upgrade at the moment
it's simple Don't buy F nvidia
IIRC 5nm chip costs for a 600mm 2 chip from TSMC was 238 in 2020 So Nvidia looks at a 30 40 increase in chip cost and raises the msrp by 300 500 The 4080 16GB has a 380mm die size so its cheaper The 3080 had a full 638mm die size so even with unspecified cost increases it should still be similarly priced or even cheaper for the chip Nvidia is just price gouging
Ironically jensen should listen to his own adivce the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past If he thinks he can keep these prices in the current state of the world Hes living in the past
Jensen is mad that he cannot loot customers without crypto boom
This MF
Buy msft consoles are available and relatively cheap especially compared to these gpus Lots of people are going to say no thanks
Aside from Nvidia doing what they do which we all agree is absolutely
Greedy asshole
Well they are not taking my money for the first time since 2004 I understand some have been waiting for an upgrade or have the budget for this series but I will skip this series
I have plenty of disposable income But at those ridiculous price points no Gaming is still just gaming I rather spend that type of money on my other hobbies like golf equipment
Nvidia is going out of gaming gpus mark my words This is the first step They gonna sell low volumes and huang will tell investors is no longer worth making gpus for gaming and only make high end stuff for datacenters and AI
It's really up to AMD to either undercut Nvidia so bad they have to drop prices or they will match Nvidia price proving Jensen right
But they need aggressive overpricing to fund their foray into 'the metaverse'
it's like they want AMD to destroy them
Nvidia s stonk price is unfortunately a thing of the past too
Unfortunately for us Not him
Go apologize to EVGA
Cool Good thing my gpu isnt the bottle neck Shitty gaming software is
Good luck with that prick We'll see in 6 8 months
No fucking way do I have that kind of money If I buy a good RTX 3080 I'd have to get it on a few years of finance s
Seeing the MSRP of the 4090 and its supposed 2x performance of a 3090 Ti has me feeling VERY good about my 700 3090 that I purchased a few months back
I honestly think Nvidia have been too greedy here and it's going to backfire As has been mentioned hundreds of times already there are so many factors going into the 40 series launch that leave the average consumer poorer than they were at the 30 series launch which will hinder demand What hasn't been talked about much is the sheer lack of new AAA games Cyberpunk came along with the 30 series and drove sales Cyberpunk also proved very publicly that if a game is poorly optimised and released prematurely then it doesn't matter what frigging hardware you've got you're getting crap performance This was the gen where I was planning to upgrade I'm happy to spend decent money on good hardware but I absolutely refuse to pay these ridiculous prices just so I can get better performance in L4D2 when I'm already getting 300 fps on my 1080 I'm either going AMD if they price fairly or I'll not bother upgrading at all until a decent new game comes out at which point I'll get a used 3080 TI
The idea of me buying one of your gpu unfortunately is a story of the past
I really don't like this
He is trying to be more like Tim Cook than Tim Cook and it's not going so well
the idea that a stock is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past
God I hope people wake up and and don't go out and buy the 40 series due to this crap with price hikes catering to miners screwing over AIB like EVGA RIP Otherwise next gen after 40 series will cost a kidney and your 1st born Hope AMD came come out swinging with their new card anouncement in NOV
Y'all created this monster tho
The 4070 is a thing of the past let me introduce to you the 4080 12GB
You can't create FOMO just by having high prices The FOMO was generated by scalpers
This dude is such a tool taking my business elsewhere for my next upgrade
The idea that faith in Nvidia is going to go up over time fortunately is a story of the past
It s already crashing with etherium going proof of stake Don t think what he says will last a year on that unless the chip shortage can leverage that
Unless you can t sell them at any price Lol
Yo AMD y'all go any of them GPUs laying around Asking for a friend
Adios NVIDIA Hello AMD
And AMD is a thing of my future No way I gonna buy green especially when EVGA pulled out
Nvidia greeding hard
Except it isnt and that dude is full of shit Prices are still on the steady decline everywhere except nvidia
The big problem is that not only does he keep raising prices but that he's always an asshole about it
i will never spend 1k on any card again fuck nvidia
It is when the company wants constant growth even when no one actually wants the new product
Lol this guy is getting replaced Stock is shit even before second waves of recession talks Gamers are a collective and talk Not falling for this BS GTX 900 series I don t blame you for upgrading but look at games now you have another 8 months easy
We will not be offering prices for the non wealthy
Well crypto mining is gone atm soooo Jensen might be in for a big
the idea that one company can rule it all in graphics cards fortunately is a story of the past
Ok then I guess the idea of sales going down unfortunately is a story of the future
Given that there's a year worth of 3000 series stock to still sell through and Nvidia has fab allotments at TSMC they HAVE to use for 4000 series AND AMD can consistently underprice them this might very well be the end of Nvidia as a company
The idea that our sales are going to go up over time unfortunately is a story of the past
also the ceo we will correct the market publicly stating manipulate so that prices won't go down by using supply and demand AMD looking better and better
looks like I'm not buying a new card too bad
The idea that my next card will be an Nvidia card is a story of the past
Lol hello AMD shakes hand This is propagandized value control This guy would lie straight to your face
the idea of your stock going up over time
Whaaaaaaaat
I don t know the guy personally but in the presentations he comes over like a egoistic asshole That paired with all these anti consumer comments makes it hard to like the guy
unfortunately a story of the past he said while lifting his shirt and slowly rubbing his
We'll see how your shareholders feel when they eat you alive for destroying your graphics card revenue stream Good thing Nvidia is doing so well in servers because I have a feeling they are about to be devoured by public opinion should AMD offer a GPU that's anywhere close with somewhat decent raytracing
The idea that gpu makers think that they can raise the cost of their products over time without market reaction unfortunately for Jensen is a story of the near future
Fuck this guy
They can politely go fuck themselves
Nvidia is able to do so because of its expanding market of professional products There are a lot of customers for their Quadro GPUs and cards for server cards like A100 which probably have a way higher profit margin than GeForce cards These professional customers also keep upgrading their hardware from time to time which keeps Nvidia's professional hardware selling making Nvidia and its investors happy In the end Nvidia is a company that wants to increase its profits for itself and its investors just like any other The best we can expect is competition from AMD and hopefully Intel
This guy is out of fucking touch You need to live within what your target can afford 1500 cards does not need to be the norm Change your greed level instead
I want him to lose Zuck Zuck levels of cash this year
Has there been ANY explanation as to why they cut 30 series cards from DLSS 3 or the new ray tracing I think nvidia is honestly just spewing bs and if anything JayzTwoCents was on to something about how TSMC won't give them a discount cause they musical chair their fabs
NVIDIA is simply addicted to COVID era profits from selling cards to miners and scalpers en masse Pretty bold of them to make these sorts of claims and assertions in the midst of their stock price plummeting I hope Jensen eats his words and gags on the taste going down when competitive cards are released by AMD and hopefully Intel next year
Tune in to AMD
My prediction here is a global one Economy is cooling off and will continue to do so more aggressively as time passes between interest rate hikes Whoever set the price point on the 40 series cards will just be fired Nobody will be able to justify spending 1600 on the price to performance ratio of these cards vs the 30 series Sales will be exceptionally poor and when there isn t a global pandemic card shortages will not exist as they did The price gouging tactics don t work in this economy and it is greedy to think they would
Feeling incredibly comfy with my RTX 3080 that I bought at MSRP right now We're in for the long haul buddy
The more you buy the cheaper it gets The same guy telling you it ain't ever going to be cheap
Greedy bastard never enough
That's what happens when you make a card during a recession and inflation People on these subreddits are very knowledgeable and from what I seen of your new video cards there are going to be people blowing up there systems by using a 750 watt power supply Which you guys say is fine yet you don't know what 750 watt power supply someone is using there's a big difference in quality The 2000 series was a flop and this one will go down as the ultimate flop 1080 TI was one of the best 3080s or not bad either I understand where he's coming from there's so many competitors and only so much supply of chips especially now but there is a reason why EVGA stepped away from dealing with Nvidia After seeing those cards and the third party cards and what this douche just wrote EVGA saved themselves a lot of money down the road
My next card will not be nvidia js
Well this is not something that Jensen decides This is something the market decides You can sail your own boat Jensen
NVDA stock was down 5 38 yesterday Coincidence Or Investors caught up to his bullshit
The idea that Nvidia is not a greedy corporate shithouse is a thing of the past Some nvidia asshole You've sold your last GPU to my household
Hey Jensen nice coat So how much do clothes cost in the matrix
He is so full of shit
Hmm let s see what amd is doing
Full AMD system in 2023 here I come
What a load of horse shit No jensen It's because you're a greedy fuck If that were true then ryzen chips would cost exponentially more to produce I have a 2070 Was eventually going to get a 3090 Saw the bullshit that is the 4000 launch and evga pulling out The absurd power draw and you're rebadging of the 4070 into a shitty 4080 Yeah never going to buy another nvidia product again Fuck You Nvidia
Make RTX 4090 cost a few millions of then if it is thousands of times faster than Geforce 256 why don't you Such cheeky bs will be cured by your competition and ending boom for mining gpus
playing games is a waste of time and money anyway i should go do something more productive
People are still gonna buy them
The idea to don t buy these RTX 40 series is a story of the present Shelf Happy profit with companies developing IA
NVIDIA is my grandpa s company AMD has now become my bread and butter of life
It's the same exact thing they did with the 20xx series and prices Not surprised at all
I am sure that shipment of 4080 and 4090 will be sold out pretty quick
The idea that NVIDIA is going to give a shit about gamers is a thing of the past
899 mid tier 4080 bro wat
Completely false
I had every intention of purchasing a 4090 if the benchmarks from yt validated their claims After reading this greedy piece of shit I m gonna buy second hand or AMD I can t condone this greed Fuck nvidia
PC gaming is about to be a story of my past Like I don t believe in buying a new GPU with each new generation but that shit is ridiculous
Imagine jacking up prices and condescending your customer base simultaneously after years of under production and over pricing They re not going to like next quarter s numbers
These guys are purposely messing with the amount of inventory to keep prices high but when everything crashes they ll go down with it
wrong lol
The idea that Jensen Huang is Nividia CEO is a story of the past
hmm okay that sounds evil
Unfortunatley you re the one artificially keeping it that way you fucking clown Im going to AMD never giving this fucking douche my money ever again
Lmao
And your employees suddenly demand their paychecks need to be padded cause the cost of labor doesn't go down either
Where were you guys since Turing Like is this just astroturf The amount of wow I wish AMD will undercut them posts are wild especially considering that even if they do you re still just gonna get a NVIDIA GPU anyways
I have a 3080 I'm hoping AMD or Intel has a well adopted response in 3 years when I need a new card Nvidia needs to feel what AMD did to Intel to get moving with customer focus
going up
I think it s the best opportunity for AMD to easily beat Nvidia by proving that wrong
Jensen has to make up for all the mining customers he lost due to the ethereum merge
Until people don't pony up and pay these exorbitant fees
Fuck this guy
Jensen can suck it As long as AMD takes this opportunity to undercut Nvidia that's where my money is going from here on He p ss me off so badly I even bought AMD stocks
All it takes is to switch to AMD out of spite until they shape up There s nothing out today that can truly challenge a high end AMD or 3090 and a 3080 will run any game very competently You don t need a 4000 series for anything NVIDIA you are greedy you treat your customer base and your business partners like shit and we ve had enough I d be ashamed to work at a zero ethics company like that
Nvidia Does nothing about bots gobbling up their cards Threans to delay the product because not enough people bought the last one due to the insane scalper prices Realizes some people were paying scalper prices and jacks up their new card to have a similar cost Yep Nope No more nvidia for me I hope these assholes implode under their own stupidity I know AMD isnt a whole lot better but they're a little less overt about rubbing my face in a pile of dogshit while they jerk each other off about metrics
Bold talk for a company that's losing to AMD Time to switch teams
reddit is so fucking insufferable its like everything is posted by a bot that repeats the same thing over and over
I have bought throughout my life 2 pre geforce cards don't remember which 480 980 1080 3070 couldn't afford the 3080 and I'm never buying a 4080 at those prices Time to check out AMD
Fuck that guy
The idea that stock price is going to go up in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past Jensen Huang Fixed it for you Down 40 from this time last year Tough times makes them desperate it seems Corporate greed sabotaging their own products in a desperate attempt to turn profits to save
Hahahahah capitalism is going great
This guy's a real shit bag
Jensen can suck my ass I hope AMD shits in his cereal this year
I purchased in December 2013 two video cards just looked up the purchase invoice to be exact Gigabyte GTX 780 455 91 Euros Gigabyte Raedon R9 280x 260 24 Euros In 6 months after the 780 came out it had already lost 150 200 Euros approximately This does not happen nowadays But the best thing is that for the 260 euros you had a card similar to a GTX 770 I imagine that the 770 would cost a bit more at the time I think I remember but I'm not sure That it was in the order of about 300 350 euros
I wouldnt mind that if you didnt start with such moon prices
I always go with 80 class gpu Not this time My 3080 will hold But if AMD pulls something out at 700 that is atleast 40 better in raster i de go for it It will take 10 years for RTX to be common and make a huge difference Nice tech though
Im not a fan of Jensen but he is speaking both truth and lies On one hand the truth part it's true that new nodes are getting wayyy more expensive per mm A 12 7nm wafer cost almost 10k a 5nm wafer is est 15k or so And while density is increasing by 180 going from 7 to 5 Nvidia must produce the largest chips it can because GPU performance scales linearly with chip size If Nvidia doesn't produce the biggest chip someone else will and will take the performance crown The performance crown IS important because it is where the most margin is made on a per mm2 basis So there is clearly an increasing cost per wafer area and the area of the top chip never decreases because performance scales with proportionally with area and the most performant chips are the highest margin chips On the other hand the lies part NVidia currently has HUGE margins as a company 60 Compared to any other company other than apple those margins are HUGE and UNATTAINABLE This is what makes NV stock price so high not to mention the levelof the crazy the stock market was In order to maintain investor confidence Jensen MUST keep these margins high so he CANNOT sell his full stack of GPUs for less than 60 margin altogether So as his costs go up he must raise prices by a multiple of his cost increases 1 0 6 1 67x price increase for every 1 increase in cost which is why prices have gone through the roof But the one thing that Jensen can't control is the volume of units that are bought HOWEVER he had a tricky trick up his sleeve which is why EVGA quit making GPUs and is exactly why a A TON OF AIB PARTNERS WILL GO BANKRUPT THIS YEAR if they only make revenue from NV gpus So Jensen draws up contracts to AIBs for them to buy X number of chips to make into GPU boards But they do not know the price until he announces the product on release day AFTER they've already bought amd produced NVs chips for them By doing this NV has already guaranteed sales and can set whatever price they want Usually this is fine because it was almost guaranteed that these GPUs would be bought by retail due to crypto etc Now that crypto is no longer a thing GPU prices are starting to decline and AIBs are forced to sell at these elevated prices They will not sell enough chips to cover their costs Due to the fact that NV has already sold them these overpriced chips NV is safe financially speaking for this generation even if nobody buys them because NV has already sold their chips The AIBs will take the fall this generation and likely go bankrupt For NV this kicks the can down the road On the next gen of NV cards NV will probably have to start cutting into it's own margins to generate sales Jensen will likely retire before next generation though
My issue with the 4000 series cards is that 95 of users don't need it I'm sure there is someone out there that'd like but for the vast majority the 3000 series will do everything you could ask it for Hell I have a 3060 right now and I struggle to make this thing push to its limits The only game that has made it go to it's limits is Star citizen but that game requires a NASA PC lmao Until NVIDIA gets their heads out of their asses and realises that they are overcharging for it no one is really gonna buy it
Sticking the cost to the consumer is the idea Gotta get them stockholder profits up
That s some bs lol He doesnt get to decide what the prices are on the aftermarket and to some degree the company has to adapt to them If they dont theyll go under Did he get some kind of Steve Jobs complex because nvidia grew during corona
The idea that some of us will afford your overpriced crap is a thing of the past
Came for the outrage Wasn t disappointed Nvidia will sell every single one of these
They will drop their 40 series card price in 6 8 months I bet
Screw him Not sure he understands economics That just means less people buying nvidia crap I guess Evga seeing the writing on the wall and getting out Guess I ll be supporting amd for all future gpu purchases I can deal with less performance to not support someone trying to screw people in a recession Things do get cheaper over time that s kinda how it works
My two 't improve with dlss on 3090 This was all for modern warfare warzone My point being that although I have the luxury to spend money here and there I think the tides are turning into amd's favor I'm probably going to go for AMD on the 7000 series mainly because of power efficiency and just forget all about nvidia I will give him video thumbs up for shadow play recording and a lot of the features that come along with the software Sucks for My circuit breaker box though it can't handle a 3090 and 3 AC units running at the same 're definitely looking to save money for similar quality just go AMD they have come a long way I hope Intel steps up their game because more competition means lesser cost for everyone
PC gaming is not worth the money anymore MMO is a nearly dead genre Most Indie games that are worth their salt come to console quickly if not immediately I ll be honest with you a 600 PS5 cranks out more performance per dollar than a hell of a lot more machines you can build That was a hard pill to swallow as a long time pcmasterrace Almost all video games cater to console spec PC is for 1440P 144hz However LG Oled TVs are so damn good in terms of value and picture quality that I ve actually defaulted to PS5 XSX for my game purchases over my 3K desktop
Good or bad price performance ratio Good 1000 series Bad 2000 series Good 3000 series Bad 4000 series I skipped buying 2000 series I suggest you do the same with 4000
Jensen Huang the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past But only for Nvidia right Right They already conditioned at least 1 4 of the base with the 30 series How many times have I read a post or reply stating 'I dunno why people are bitching about a 1200 3080 You get what you pay for It's just what it is ' Meanwhile this is probably their first video card they purchased and they think it's 2x better because it's 2x the cost Well this is absolute shit thinking and that's what got us here today so great job Jensen your cuntery status has reached another high
It's that they're not even staying the same cost Dude is really unhinged and honestly I think Jensen is pushing this narrative at AMD more than consumers so that they look justified in their pricing if AMD follows that narrative and people will still go for nvidia if the prices are that close he's trying to go at it from all angles Really hoping AMD will be cool this gen I don't have the money for scalped pricing
Welp looks like my next GPU is going to be AMD
Technically speaking the 4090 actually costs less 1500 bucks when the 3090 came out is now worth more like 1700 due to inflation in the US
Yeah I'm keeping to my 3080ti for the time being It'll be a while before I think of moving on
Well they re in a market with zero competition Look at their stock prices Jensen has to focus on increasing that margin he operates at a 60 margin and has to maintain that Anything less will reduce investor confidence Add that to the fact that AMD can t even hold a candle to Nvidia and he can do effectively whatever he wants It s a really cool thing for Nvidia as a whole nothing but profit all the way
Chip manufacturing has gone up in price
I mean tbh if you account for inflation they aint scalping
My last Nvidia GPU was an 8800 gts and that's cause Nvidia gave it to me for free at their 2006 reality tour Never was a fan of them
Jensen should definitely avoid large picture windows This is not going to go well
I got a MSI ventus 3x plus 3080 12gig on Thursday from egx it's a games con for a not Very cheap 749 99 and it will be very long time before I get another gpu if ever going by the insane prices the 40 series of GPUs are going for
So why not just wait then until next year or so when the 5000 series cards are released and then buy a 4000 or even 3000 series card on discount I fail to see how the price of these new cards justify the return on performance for the typical gamer of course that could be said for just about any recently released generation of GPU We have been at the point of diminishing returns where current gen GPUs provide more performance than current gen games can utilize There are only a handful of games that even take full advantage of DX12 And even fewer that take advantage of RTX like Ray Tracing DLSS etc Seems silly to spend thousands of dollars on a piece of hardware that will sit in your PC be heavily under utilized
Literally what is the issue 4090 is 400 less than the 3090ti and only 100 more than a 3090 Yall are holding on to the days of 200 gpus and those are never coming back
I hate to be the voice of reason to all the doom posting here but the 30 series cards are still amazing cards this isn t going to kill pc gaming Also you aren t going to see 500 dollar consoles in the upcoming generations probably be like 7 800 as inflation TSMC fuckery hits I m still pissed at nVidia but can we stop doomposting
I have no idea how gpus work but wouldn t a price increase make sense Aren t they improving upgrading rethinking the technology for the next gen Wouldn t that use more material bigger cooling different chip sets I know the ideal is to at least maintain the price but if the only way to increase the performance from last gen is to use a more expensive technology wouldn t the price increases be justified
You guys won't like this take but The price of raw materials is sky rocketing The price of labor is sly rocketing Moors law is effectively dead And inflation is also skynrocketing These factors combined make his statement make sense
If true both Nvidia and AMD chips are going to get more expensive and anyone else trying to enter the game Chip design manufacturing is not cheap especially on advanced nodes at 3nm
This is some agedlikemilk shit in the making lol
Apple CEO wait what Even Apple reduces their prices hahaha
I will buy 3 or 4 used 3080 3090 from miners before i buy 1 new 4080 4090 at prices he is forcing people to sell at It will also be the first time in over two decades I will consider AMD
He saw people were ok to pay twice the price during the shortage unfortunately that was meant to happen
I sincerely hope Nvidia's profit margins take a hit bad enough not to knock them out of business but just enough to get this fucking clown voted off the board
For high end he is right Tsmc raised wafer prices
Someone's gotta pay for the upkeep of that shitty jacket
Man s getting a head start for the Taiwanese war
Well 's hard for things to go down in price when the monetary policy of the country inflates over
Here's me still rocking a 280 series card on my laptop and seeing 70 fps in New World 4k with all graphics set to max
I wanted to upgrade from my old ROG laptop getting a shiny new Gen rig and all that can last me a few years Guess I'm fucked now upside down face
The story of doubling the cost of entry is upon us
Question Isn't the rare minerals needed to create those components getting less common and more expensive
Definitely my next gpu will be a AMD Pompous asshole who got spoiled from all the crpto bros buying his shit at outrageous prices Those days are over
Im rooting for amd to come up with something good and affordable between the performance of 3080 and 4080
unfortunately Mr Jose Juan it s the market that decides that
Was going to upgrade my 3080 to a 4080 but there s no way I would do it with that price I m happy to sit on my existing card for many years and switch to amd next round
Fuck that I'm just buying a steam deck and keeping my 1080 till she dies
Amd ftw
The price will certainly drop if people refuse to buy them
Bollocks
fsr and dlss already are putting nvidia's stock price 1 foot in the grave long gone are the needs to replace gpu every 2 years slap some shitty fsr or dlss on it and boom you get 20 30 more fps capable enough to prevent you from making a 1000 purchase lol we will see whos laughing
Nvidia has fucked up alternate generations for twice this time
Have you seen Nvidia's stock price It went from 139 down to 125 in 2 days
That's fine Leather Jacket you'll be a thing of the past
In short the 4000 series is delayed and until the 3000 series is sold you can only buy it at a gold price
Nvidia is just pricing out the scalpers from the get go and making the price high
He's probably right and using the words unfortunately we haven't been quite the same now supply wise for quite some time and then inflation And bringing more chip factories to the US isn't a measure on making things cheaper just national security issues He's probably right and not trying to be a dick
Aren't there like defined stages of grief or something I wonder what stage Jensen's in over the failure to buy ARM
Unfortunately Yes how unfortunate for you Prick I was going to buy a 4090 before all this Now I'm going to wait for Team Red
We have found that we can get away with price gouging so unfortunately we are going to continue to do that
Well this has made things easier for AMD
Honestly the only reason I am even considering an Nvidia card is because I have a g sync monitor and would be removing that feature
How
Nvidia has until May 23 to sell AI cards to China at a huge market they will use their fab capacity for those chips We consumers are secondary
I'm upset I bought a 3080 before the crash but I'm happy I bought a 3080
That makes absolutely no sense Stop being so fucking greedy
Pretty certain a company as wealthy as Nvida can actually absorb some costs Look at Sony And yes I know its tech isnt as advance But they absorbed the costs to make pricing competitive x200B Amazon do the same x200B Different devices but similar bank accounts Nvidia is greedy Retailers will drop costs anyway
they just created demand for used GPUs
so the product will become more expensive with every new version that s what that means
Is he saying moore s law is over
You guys are missing the point Nvidia doesnt want to sell 4000 cards just yet They want to sell all the 3000 cards first which is why these are priced so absurdly high They dont expect these to fly off the shelves just yet
I am not an engineer so please take what I say with a huge grain of salt If other people think this is wrong please comment below to tell me how I'm wrong I think I understand what he's saying but it's still bullshit I'm going to estimate on the high end that the card costs around 50 75 more to make due to inflation supply chain constraints TSMC no longer giving volume discounts and upping their wafer price etc In 2020 a full size die chip costed around 240 dollars to make Even if we double that the price is 480 Add in memory chips fans etc and I doubt that price exceeds 1k With more advanced processes rnd costs inflation and other things added into the mix I can see chip production cost not going down Do I think the 4080 12gb deserves to be at 900 Nope sounds like Nvidia is trying to maintain margins
I'm smell a lawsuit for false advertising if you watch the last year video is almost the same exact way 2x 4x faster what a bunch of marketing bs
He can stick the 4090s up his ass I'm not getting one I'll wait
I think these companies need to quit being sleezy
Okay yeah so long as you blatantly withhold product of course the prices will stay high Increase demand and reduce supply and no shit the bid goes up man facepalming
I bet the 40 series still won't use all of the transistors
And so will Nvidia's profits be when AMD choose to cut their balls off with a range of reasonably priced cards
Upgrading my GPU every 2 years will also be a story of the past
Gamers should boycott Nvidia and write everywhere how anti gamer anti competitive and awfully greedy the company is I don't know a single person who is going to buy the 40X0 series The are ruining PC gaming and video game industry as a whole Aside from other greedy companies
Hmm people just refused to buy 1k GPUs let's release 1k GPUs And they'll cost even more next year Aren't you excited
No big deal if that's real I play lots of games but I'm not interested in more and more photo realistic games anyways Game studios will compete for the most creative games with the most fun game play They will certainly not produce games that don't run on most machines The possibilities are endless already High performance graphics are not that important
Without miners that buy 100 GPUs each no matter the costs he'll revert back to we were able to produce for much lower cost for the customers 1
Don t need a new gpu
I guess that in the future nVIDIA is going to focus to other markets and this is what jensen was trying to tell us in this presentation I'm afraid that in the future computer gaming is going to become borderline impossible These prices keep going up and up for marginal gains
That is not true at all he is just saying that to drive prices up
All throughout the history of computing there are promising chip makers who are long buried because they misjudged the market from Cyrix Sun to IBM Motorola There always just remains Intel and AMD
It all depends on the demand is it not If your customers decide that what you offer does not justify the price you will cut costs But also people's income isn't keeping up with your price increase There will be a point where there won't be enough people to buy your stuff
I really hope they sell like trash Nvidia need to suffer a financial blow that they should have had over a decade ago due to their scummy anti consumer practices
This is bullshit Yes manufacturing costs are going up But not enough to negate the advantages of more modern process nodes They could've easily scaled back and build an improvement for the same price as the previous generation The fact that other electronics providers can do it means Nvidia is just spewing BS
Dodgy used Miner RTX 3080 my body is ready now
In other words you all are rich so we are gonna charge what we think is a fair price for rich people That s what he s really saying
It's a market opportunity for AMD Value for your dollar can be AMD's selling point with these rediculious prices
Slowly becoming the villain
Did anybody actually read the article He's talking about the chip wafer discs not the cards themselves
Okay Mr wannabe Tim Cook
It's up to all of us to not stand for this nonsense
This is almost like the don t you all have cell Phones
Lololol Time to change the narrative From now on profit only goes UP up arrow No more fuxkin around
The idea that Nvidia will be top market over time unfortunately is a story of the past
Jensen you want to buy my 2080ti for 1300
I got a used 3060 or maybe it was a 40 off eBay for like 700 and probably won t replace it until it burns out What is the point of getting new graphics card every couple of years when the last like 5 generations of multiple brands are still good enough to play everything that s available and will be available for a few more years It s like iPhones Do you really need a iPhone 14 to use tiktok or browse Reddit or Imgur
Unfortunately scalpers will empty the stock within seconds after release Their target audience is scalpers
Unfortunately the idea that I'm going to buy an overpriced gpu is a story of the past
The idea that I would by a Nvidia card again sadly is also a story of the past
We build the chips and we sell the cards so WE monopolise the prices
Especially when you lie about what it is so you can double it's price
So he saying goodbye consumers huh Well with this I'm going AMD or Intel arc a780 for my next gpu upgrade next year
Er my boss didn't get the message Wages say that back catalog looks enticing for 2022 2023
He says as he lowers the older 3000 series prices
Looks like my 20 year old history of buying Nvidia cards is a story of the past as well
People really need to broaden their narrative regarding chip costs as most of the public in these threads are obsessed with the silicon fab being the main driver of cost Design and Validation take most of the cost actually With these 2 items growing up exponentially And these are costs that nvidia intel AMD et al as well have to eat on top of the actual manufacturing costs from the fab packaging and testing part of their supply chain The thing is that outfits like NVIDIA need to either maximize volume or margins Growing volume exponentially to match their design costs is harder than generating their needed margins for profitability from smaller volume higher price Jensen is basically talking to their investors NVIDIA is focusing on high margin products from datacenter and the pro high end gaming segments They are probably conceding the 600 gaming value tier segment to consoles Which makes sense In previous generations NVIDIA could leverage their designs from smaller dies for value business desktops laptops which use most of the building blocks scaled replicated up in the larger dies So that they got a revenue source to subsidize the rest of their dies However iGPUs from AMD Intel and SoCs are getting good enough that there is little value added for NVIDIAs low end dGPUs So that avenue is drying up So basically Jensen is saying to the investors that NVIDIA is going mostly premium and datacenter tiers
This just crossed my mind When it comes to market response to the tactics Nvidia is employing with the 40 series all it takes are large contract buyers to scarf up these cards at ridiculous prices Then in reality the gamer market truly is of minimal consequence I dont know if they indeed have large contract buyers in place already but if so there really isnt much leverage remaining for the average personal consumer
did he really say that and recently If that's the case then man I might not be buying NVidia
Oh yeah Then so are my purchases of your cards If AMD sells at cheaper price then bye bye Nvidia
Wow between this event and EVGA closing GPU shop who else can't think the door is being left open for AMD or Intel less so imo If AMD continues and pushes driver dev for video processing rendering etc could be really good for consumers I've decided I'll not likely upgrade any of the PCs for this gen that would normally be considered 30 series is becoming more plentiful these looks like well dunno
I think people need to understand how the development of chips has changed since reaching 3nm 5nm and 7nm The technology involved to shrink beyond this point is expensive and no longer is just based on better architecture The photolithography machines needed for these feats are ground breaking in technology costing millions per machine 1 machine can handle up to 100 wafers and 1 wafer has hundreds of chips With a world in supply of billions you will need a lot of these
Really hoping AMD can come spank Nvidia this gen We ll see I definitely was team green but I just jumped ship to 6900xt and am loving it
Jensen getting greedy
Yeah i think a lot of us who are coming from the 1080ti or so are waiting for the 3000 series to drop or taking a serious look at AMD J especially if we want to move to 4k 120 or higher DLSS just brings us close enough to have a smooth experience If prices continue to fall enough then i'm thinking of just copping a 3090 settling for a 42in 4k120 OLED for the foreseeable future
burn u greedy motherfucker
It's kind of scary when a precipice is reached during the high point of the processor market The most disturbing moment was during the rise of ryzen processors vs the intel processors when things started to look equal and shaky to intel and profitable to AMD Now that Nvidia is near that equality with AMD they are trying their best to ensure all investors that the market will not change but it's slowly getting to that point where if nvidia doesn't push harder to monopolize they will end up sharing those shareholders with AMD
lol ite bro
I remember my history when Nvidia took over as top graphics chip because 3DFX 'decided' thing like this instead of listening and innovating instead It's situations like that where it's great AMD exists and hopefully can put more pressure against NVidia this time around
Jen needs to clear the 30xx inventory Smart
That hasn't been true since the 1990s A new chip released a decade ago costs the same today as it did at release Has been for decades
That's not really how the open market works The customer is always right and they will determine if chip prices fall or rise
Pure bullshit Unless chips grind to a design halt which is still not the case He's trying to sell us on the idea we should buy this overpriced hardware and it's unrealistic
The issue isn t just the price of the chip going down It s the perceived value of the item being sold Don t sell us a 4070 value of product with a 4080 12gb on the box That s like pissing in the cloven flakes and telling us it s milk Yeah I understand that they are trying to recuperate financial losses that they themselves helped facilitate with the crypto balloon But what they are doing is shady shit
I am altering the deal Pray I don t alter it any further
Unfortunately
He s right a can of Pringles cost like double what it did 5 years ago
I thought the more you buy the more you save Jensen
Yes there are You're not trying hard enough to find a solution
The idea nvda is going to go up over time is a story of the past
Team RED let's go
Interesting I think I hear something that rhymes with Mey Mem Mee Madeon maphics mard calling my name once I need to upgrade my 1660 Super
smiling face with tear
Can t wait until nobody buys the 40 series and their stock takes a huge shit I say this while also holding a substantial position w Nvidia
He's not talking about cards He's talking about the lithography TSMC isn't getting any cheaper
And if not we will uNfOrTuNaTeLy have to price fix and manipulate the market to make it so
I ll just buy AMD I m way late on supporting them anyways Cya Nvidia
That's funny I forsee Nvidias market share going up being a story of the past as well Balls in your court AMD
The idea that I will continue playing games on pc will become a story of the past
When I can manipulate the market why would the price of my video cards go down Jensen
I m not buying one cause I don t need it It s a luxury I can t afford It s not something I can justify investing in as if I would use it for mining They are going to be in for one rude awakening
Watch what happens when people don't buy your shit
Honestly that is not a bad thing We'll just have cheaper chips from lower tiers of new generations that consume less power and make use of more upscaling tech to be efficient Right RIGHT
Well he s just fucking delusional
Look at me I m the scalper now
bull shit right now they wont but they will
The idea were gonna put our hands in our wallets for cards of this price is also a thing of the past
With the increasing cost of living and recession on the horizon these prices will curtail pc gaming upgrades for rtx 40 series significantly A better investment for most people would be a console The flow on effect will be more developers focusing on the console market and thus more pc 'ports'
The idea that sales are going to occur at any price is also then a story of the past Mr Huang
unfortunately I see he talks through the mouths of others now
I expect this trend to continue to the point that their pricing matches it
Fucking nvidia gtx 1050 crapped out on me 2 years
I don't think the 40 series is going to sell like the COVID Crypto 30 series especially with the sudden availability of new stock retired crypto farmers failed scalpers selling off their now useless profitless cards
Now we know why EVGA is dropping Nvidia Jensen is getting greedy
In 2009 I bought a GTX 285 for 342 on sale from 395 In 2015 I bought a GTX 980Ti for 630 on sale from 680 In 2022 they're telling me that the RTX 4080 the real one is 1200 In 2029 the WTF 7080 will retail for 2100 MSRP 2200 Founders 3000 from scalpers that get first access to each limited production run Nvidia will wonder why no one wants to buy GPUs anymore
There's no way consumer chips at 1k euro or more can be profitable at least massively In Europe where wages are lower than in the US that's half a months of income or more for most of the people There's also a massive recession and most people are having issues paying their bills with the inflation and high energy prices So that means the market for these is already very low It's not going to be a high volume product So that means that if they want them all to sell it's going to be low volume and high profit margin I would conclude purely based on logic that these are the cards people drool over and pushes them to buy Nvidia products at the lower end like the higher volume 50 and 60 series But even those went up massively in price I'm still rocking my 1060 which I bought for 200 euro The cheapest 3060 starts at 430 euros and I'm already priced out of that The cheapest 3050 is 330 euro which is already more than I want to pay My xbox series s was 299 euro If prices for the new cards are even higher and the mining craze is over I have a feeling that they will have to drop prices or the PC gaming market will be stagnant or will shrink I still think the only reason the prices of GPUs went up massively the last few years is only because of mining and supply chain and these prices are not sustainable for the PC gaming market With low volume of sales and high barrier of entry PC gaming might be set back a few decades where people thought pc gaming was dead
Please AMD improve your RT performance
Things like this is why I predicted the day after the most recent earnings NVDA will be sub 100 by end of Q1 of next year and perhaps sooner Sub 70 by end of 2023
almost like he has a stake in you buying now
Unfourtunately
This gen cards are a joke I'll stick to 20 and 30 series maybe by 60 I'll buy new system
My fear now is if gamers stop buying the new cards NVIDIA will find a way to break or throttle our old cards to force us to buy something new
Sales records Unfortunately a thing of the past
Silence brand
uNfOrTuNaTeLy
Idea that performance uplift comes from some architecture innovation also and not just brute forcing more transistors onto the die also seems to be the dtory of the past
Yup it's just me and you against the world now 3080
Jensen to the consumers the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past Jensen to the stockholders the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time fortunately is a story of the past
don t support nvidia buy amd ati watch the prices fall
The 3000 series on paper and without the pandemic and miners was an insanely good deal Remember how the 2000 series wasn't that much of a bumb save rtx This gen has such preposterous pricing that I don't care if the 4090 butters my toast and irons my clothes I'm not touching it The real win here will be cheaper 3000 series cards They're beastly and it's going to be a great time to buy one I hope some clever developers grant is dlss 3 as well but even if they don't screw nVidia for this naked price gouge Hey Intel make a card that competes and sell it at half the price
Let's see how this ages when their sales don't meet expectations
I've never had an AMD card it's never too late as i swaped from Intel to Ryzen I'll go from Nvidia to AMD no problem bois want money let the content creators pay for their cards and have the gamers enjoy the prices they deserve
Seems like he's saying that they are unable to innovate enough to stay competitive If this is the new pricing norm for Nvidia they'll have to accept less sales and the fact that they are pricing themselves out of the market
Holy fuck this dude is so out of touch We'll see how mining period prices sell with mining being totally dead
You increase the prices without actually stay in line with performance anyway this article analyze it pretty well 4000 series the numbers dont add up So i have basically to pay the double to downgrade the actual series 80
I'll wait for AMD offerings to do a last purchase that I'll keep for at least 5 years until the dust settles Nothing is making sense
This is entirely BS Nvidia made a the Federal Reserve will keep rates high until something in the market losing mindshare and stock price will inevitably fall due to macro economic conditions If gamers can hold off for 12 motnhs and not buy that would force nvidia to shave their margins in half stuck between the FED crushing them and Gamers that wont buy their high margins Of course I dont see gamers having the cahones to hodl We actually have more leverage in this market opposite of what others are saying
Jensen is kinda right if you think about it There are a huge number of games that run like complete shit and its not the fault of the GPU Game Devs just need to do a much better job of optimization
well then pc gaming actually being a worthwhile competitor to the console market from a price standpoint was fun while it lasted
The idea that a CEO is irreplaceable or indispensable is a story of the past Jensen has already discounted gamers as a big part of his future business assuming most of his future businesses are in AI and large server GPU compute farms But what if you build it but nobody The best most expensive design often loses to mediocre more affordable designs 680x0 vs 8086
I imagine MS and Xbox had the same mindset until the consumer nearly shunned them after the 360s issues and XB1 Kinnect roll out Now I'd argue they put the most effort into seeming consumer centric I'd bet Nvidia would change tone real quick if the consumers gave them the same treatment
I hope everyone that has sense doesn't buy Nvidia this gen I know there are people with more money than sense fanboys I hope this is enough to make a dent in Jensen's thick skull
Good for you Nvidia Thank you to all the crypto miners for showing Nvidia how much money they could actually sell their GPU'S for You ruined it for everyone Nvidia is now going to price out all the people who helped you get there Looks like AMD and INTEL going forward
Good luck with that many pc gamers have other hobbies competing with the same funds and surely the other stuff is more important than spending more on a gpu
Its ok people will still pay for it
Hopefully shitvidia will be a story of the past as well
Wouldn't it be someone if EVGA and XFX started making Intel arc boards Doubtful that it'd be with the A series but I could see it for the B series Intel arc reminds me a lot of the earlier AMD cards Good hardware bad software If Intel can fix their issues and and Intel could impact nvidia big time
Translation we can no longer innovate we need to keep shareholders happy
so by time we get to RTX 8090 its gonna cost 5k lol
inflation
You see me I am the scalper now
Im holding onto my 3080 forever at this point I somehow managed to get it below msrp so im Really just praying it ages like 8800gtx and 1080ti
I have a 3080 but probably going AMD mext time I upgrade
He wont be saying that when the massive oversupply of rtx 3000 and rtx 4080 12 gb doesnt sell at all because we are clearly in a recession
Little did he know all their previous numbers relied on miners to actually sell
I guess the guy needs more money to buy ALL the leather jackets in the world I mean shit he is only worth 18 billion US Dollars We need to have a GoFundMe for JensenJackets or just buy some perfectly priced Ada LL
He needs to step down Nvidia is all hype now Everything other than the 4090 in the last gen of GPUs is a joke I sincerely hope that AMD rips them a new one in the future as they have been with Intel Considering you can get a RX 7900 XTX for half the cost of a 4090 with only slightly less performance Its already a no brainer for working class folks
1080 for me They just make it harder and harder to upgrade DLSS is nice but I'll live without it and FSR is getting better so I'm waiting for AMD to show their new gen and hope they won't scalp us as much If not I'm buying a cheap 6800XT and be done for another 3 gens
I was really excited for the 4080 Nvidia's announcement convinced me I should instead be excited for the 7800XT 7900XT Here's coming from a 970
Yeah I ve been on the fence for months looking for a reason to go AMD to replace my 1060 since I have a ryzen processor and here it is
I don't want to sadden you but don't expect AMD to be good Samaritan Sure their cards will be a little cheaper probably by 50 100 bucks depending on tier but will trail in RT performance as AMD is basically generation behind on RT So if all you primarily care is raster performance you may save like 100 bucks but if you care about RT then idk People already forgot how they've been selling lowest Zen2 entry a mid range 6 core R5 5600X at 299 till Intel offered faster CPU at 115 less then of a sudden R5 5600 appeared and they dropped CPU prices across the board by nearly 30 Idk why do people expect AMD to sell GPUs at much lower prices
We're flirting with recession at least in the US 1k cards will fly off the shelves NVIDIA will want to lean hard on the older chips since when did computing stop being a volume business face with spiral eyes
Im not a fan of Jensen but he is speaking both truth and lies On one hand the truth part it's true that new nodes are getting wayyy more expensive per mm A 12 7nm wafer cost almost 10k a 5nm wafer is est 15k or so And while density is increasing by 180 going from 7 to 5 Nvidia must produce the largest chips it can because GPU performance scales linearly with chip size If Nvidia doesn't produce the biggest chip someone else will and will take the performance crown The performance crown IS important because it is where the most margin is made on a per mm2 basis So there is clearly an increasing cost per wafer area and the area of the top chip never decreases because performance scales with proportionally with area and the most performant chips are the highest margin chips On the other hand the lies part NVidia currently has HUGE margins as a company 60 Compared to any other company other than apple those margins are HUGE and UNATTAINABLE This is what makes NV stock price so high not to mention the levelof the crazy the stock market was In order to maintain investor confidence Jensen MUST keep these margins high so he CANNOT sell his full stack of GPUs for less than 60 margin altogether So as his costs go up he must raise prices by a multiple of his cost increases 1 0 6 1 67x price increase for every 1 increase in cost which is why prices have gone through the roof But the one thing that Jensen can't control is the volume of units that are bought HOWEVER he had a tricky trick up his sleeve which is why EVGA quit making GPUs and is exactly why a A TON OF AIB PARTNERS WILL GO BANKRUPT THIS YEAR if they only make revenue from NV gpus So Jensen draws up contracts to AIBs for them to buy X number of chips to make into GPU boards But they do not know the price until he announces the product on release day AFTER they've already bought amd produced NVs chips for them By doing this NV has already guaranteed sales and can set whatever price they want Usually this is fine because it was almost guaranteed that these GPUs would be bought by retail due to crypto etc Now that crypto is no longer a thing GPU prices are starting to decline and AIBs are forced to sell at these elevated prices They will not sell enough chips to cover their costs Due to the fact that NV has already sold them these overpriced chips NV is safe financially speaking for this generation even if nobody buys them because NV has already sold their chips The AIBs will take the fall this generation and likely go bankrupt For NV this kicks the can down the road On the next gen of NV cards NV will probably have to start cutting into it's own margins to generate sales Jensen will likely retire before next generation though
I will just buy a 3080 which is very capable of playing any games I want on high framerate on 1440p for the next 4 5 years In 2 years from now they will release a gpu with twice the performance of the 4090 for less money so I prefer being smart with my money instead of being an idiot and throw the money I worked for on the scam tactics Nvidia is using
4080 6GB incoming
Nvidia went all out this generation because they wanted to be certain to stay firmly on top of AMD The cost was more expensive silicon per mm 2 more mm of it more power delivery more cooling more engineering And Nvidia seems to be doubling down on software hardware co development with DLSS3 The result is that the new higher end cards are very expensive and probably faster than AMD if not more efficient Nvidia is still making money on these of course but maybe not any more than last generation All of the supply contracts and late design decisions were made in a world where top tier cards sold for 2000 I hope the future brings back mainstream cards for reasonable cost size and power draw with less aggressive performance targets
AMD isn't going to offer much cheaper options They will look at price performance and offer a better deal may be by 10ish percent but not much more
Yes it will still sell like hotcakes I don't know the trend in the West but even in my poor country the enthusiasts are still eager to buy this for bragging reasons and culture of being top of the pcmasterrace
I wonder if Nvidia has ever bought back used cards to reduce the supply and drive sales of their new products
Forget the cost I'm turning towards 3000 series because I don't want to have to put my tower in an ice bath
Demand drives the price not anything he says
Luckily I mean unfortunately chip prices are going up
AMD has been very smart with their Ryzen brand I think they will be willing to sell at a low profit margin to take a large portion of the market Nvidia is losing partners and now customers are turning on them I mean they are following facebooks trajectory I think most people will be happy with finally getting an MSRP 30 series or switching to next gen AMD It ll be interesting
It's sure going to be interesting in 2 years when they're looking to throw a new architecture in that will have to have at least roughly 20 performance gains 3000 for a basic model and 800 watts is just not a sustainable future
advice from someone in team red don't switch to team red
But there's another side to the story RTX 40 series are manufactured by TSMC which is based out of Taiwan If China Taiwan tensions escalate it might slow down the production of 40 series GPUs As a result 30 series being more readily available would be consistently in demand So Nvidia probably won't see a need to reduce the price of its 30 series any further
Nvidia has interesting options for every price point it doesn t matter what gen it is People are just complaining they re broke
Waiting for either a dlss 3 cracked file for it to run on 3 series or will see what happens with the upcoming AMD stuff I can afford the 4's but f ck em
Why do people switch to team red Legitimately asking
This Series will sell nowhere near 30 series They probably set up this absurd price point because of their out of the roof profits they're less worried on how the sales on these cards are going to go compared to previous gen something like from 10xx series to 20xx series We've reached the second gen of RTX and still have very little implementations os RTX in games and DLSS is not as good as they market it and 1080p is still the most used resolution worldwide All that said 4080 4090 are the sparkling champagne of graphics cards only enthusiasts will go for them 30xx will still be the sweet spot for the next months maybe years
To be fair anyone buying a 1000 card should consider it an investment and not a purchase at this point
Or raise the price of 20 30 series to the point it makes sense to get the 40
Ah yes the fake 4080 Don tcha mean 4070
for a public company investors are always the real 'customer'
people are turning to the older 20 and 30 series cards due to price Honestly this is my situation right now I was excited to finally get an 80 series GPU and faithfully saved up Then comes the announcement that the baseline model will be 900 and all that goes out the window Hey at least I'll get a 9 series card
They will sell like hot cakes Scalpers set the price last time with the 30s cards Nvidia figures if they are going to be scalped at that price might as well charge that price to begin with
Close enough but he's taking to buyers of 30 series Trying to scare them into buying overstock product at a hefty price point
Nvidia is down like 40 a share he's scared AF about the shareholders
They aren't gonna sell well We are in the midst of a recession families don't have the disposable income The upper middle class professionals are having their student loans kick back in in December People have less disposable income
They are going to throttle supply to keep demand high
I've got no doubt in my mind the cards will once again sell out at launch It happens every gen even with the 20 series that pissed everyone off
That s exactly what they want Listen they now have piles of 30 series cards in stock that they can t sell and brought 40s at a more than normal price They will manufacture fewer amount of 40s for those who are able to buy without hurting their wallet Now to everyone else 30s look like a good deal all of a sudden Once they sell majority of the left over stock they bring down 40s price where it should have been in the first place GG
I've been running AMD cards for the last 10 years Was thinking this was going to be the gen that I would switch to Nvidia Nope lol
4070 12GB Let's not forget how Nvidia is so scummy now they didn't have the balls to call a 900 card a 4070 so they called it a 4080 12GB Ram amount is not the only difference between the 4080s so you are going to get a boat load of people buying it thinking its only 4 GB less ram and not a massive difference in Cuda cores The 4080 12GB is either a 4070 or it is the real 4080 and the 4080 16GB is a 4080ti It sucks to see the Fall of Nvidia but I guess its about time for it They have grown to the Villian stage of their History Unless something massive changes I like many others are probably done with Team Green
I got my b product 7970 2013 release on 2014 for 125 euros down from 250 300 Everything after that is a nightmare for buyers
I member Seriously I remember 1060s at 150 Now you can't get a 3060 for less than 400 Inflation and manufacturing costs did not go up nearly that much
Hate to break it to people but the 780 released in 2013 for 650 Punch that into an inflation calculator and you get 830
In 2009 the AMD then ATi 5870 was released which was the second GPU I ever bought In this review it is described as the fastest graphics card ever but disappointingly pricey This was at a price of 300
For my first build in 2016 I remember splurging on the 400 1070 after budgeting for the 300 1060 Tariffs have happened since then though
Remember when you could get a pizza for 5
this was before 1440p and 4k gaming Now sadly if you want to game in 4k it's cost too much
Remember inflation
Inflation plus rising costs from increased complexity Just because salaries haven t risen by the same amounts or at all doesn t negate those key factors There s also the argument to be made that with mining demand dropping they predict to sell less cards so by charging more they can make up for that They will still sell well
The last time I bought a mid tier card it was 200 This was almost ten years ago
I'm still waiting for a 250 card even used Till then my 1060 is going strong
I paid like 140 for a Radeon HD 5750 in 2010 ran Fallout New Vegas like a boss
My first gpu upgrade was 50 and ran games at the then standard of 30 fps
Pepperridge farms remembers angry face
I remember when the 3080 was announced at 699 and we thought wtf happened to 1080 pricing Then they get greedy again cause they figure we had the wallets and desperation for 699 so why not 1199 The 3080 12gb sales were used to determine how far they could dig into our wallets
There has been inflation over the last 7 years or so since Pascal If we accept that silicon is more expensive to make and design for and some components have become more expensive I could tolerate 400 as a mainstream card 6700 XT has a few deals under this bar and no one would argue that it's a low end product
It's funny how people supposedly earn the same amount but then you have shitload of buckled up 3080 ti's pics with captions gotta protect mah baby
Who would have thought that on Steam 1060 and Rx580 are the most used GPUs which happen to share similar pricing and performance which had ridic good price performance ratio It helps that most people probably only dick around in 1080p
If these prices continue PC gaming will be a story of the past
Came here to see if anyone else is feeling this way Never again and I think they are saying you will buy our chips at the prices we tell you even though the cost does drop That's basic manufacturing the more you make the cheaper they are This is a outright lie
Huang 2 years later Overpriced video chips is a story of the past We are desperate our stock prices are falling down rapidly please buy our rtx 4090 for 600 usd No ok how about 500 What you mean you need to pay 5000 usd per month for electricity and can't afford it Ok final offer buy it for 399 and get a free Cyberpunk 2077 the only game that utilizing new features What you mean you already have it and it runs fine on your 3090 you bought for 299 Ok fine buy 4090 for 299 Wait where are you going We have dlss 3 0 Remix We nerfed your 3000 drivers to perform 50 slower
I wish I can go back to AMD but I have a gsync monitor so I'm stuck
Exactly what i was thinking I m still kicking myself for getting a 3080 10gb instead of a 6800xt
Same I'm buying Intel's most powerful gpu when they finally come out
He's not wrong tho we've hit a technological wall and they have to make chips larger and more power hungry to provide performance increase Which drives the price up It's true that a completely different architecture can provide substantial improvements but development of a new architecture from scratch requires massive investment and will drive the price up even more
Yup Looks like my next chip will be red First time ill be purchasing AMD since i started bulding PCs Im not going to put up with that type of smugness from a CEO no matter how much I like their GPUs and the tech they have built with them Go to hell Huang Youre going to lose LOTS of customers Not only because the greedy pricing and bullshit skus but also because of the shitty attitude This leaves NO room at all for mid grade card purchases at these price points Its straight corporate greed Maybe if you didnt placate to the miners when they were in full effect then the company wouldn't need to be making their money back so badly I hope they get stuck with so much stock of 4080s and 4090s and that masked up 4070 12gb I can see why EVGA jumped ship This is nuts
Same top comment about the same story You guys just farming karma
It's cute that you think you're hurting anyone but yourself by buying a worse product
Doubt
I suppose if their prices go back down below 300 for a regular graphics card I might reconsider But I'm being told that's a thing of the past which is fitting since ATI was my first graphics card after Voodoo So I guess it's time to go back to the past OK hand absolutely zero reasons to pick NVIDIA over AMD ATI now
Yeah a lot of people I know warned me against even buying the 3070 but the timing wasn't good so I couldn't go with a 6800 which I would've gone with if I could've Linux cooperation from Nvidia is absolutely sub 't like how things are going with Windows 11 so I'm probably going to stick with Win10 and hope to switch to Linux full time by 2025 The market is ripe for competition
This is hilarious and its quite funny how some of these companies are forgetting basic supply and demand they do not control shit people are largely going to abandon the idea of buying a 40 series unless they have a ton of expendable income and dont mind a new space heater
Ayy this person gets it
I have no brand allegiance But I do have certain expectation from AMD Intel and Nvidia for GPU I'm going to buy based on what API applications can be supported from those 3 in 2028
As others said if these prices continue every 5 6 years I'm gonna buy an older gpu and play older games and so on I paid 800 for my whole pc I'm never gonna fking spend 800 for a gpu
Is there an alternate to nvidia s gpu I thought the competition is more or less not existing
I've been Nvidia exclusive since my Riva TNT2 This change hurts
Lol face with tears of joy
At this point I dont care about ray tracing anymore AMD it is or I'll use my 3070 til it breaks
I don't know much about graphics chip Still have the 1070 Are Radeon cards comparable
I m with you I ve never even considered an AMD GPU before but the next time I build a PC I plan to go red
PS5 looks as good as my 2070 super was or better At the time the 2070s was 600 retail IIRC Console gaming is a great option now I don t miss PC often Only game I truly missed is satisfactory so I got a steam deck cause I m a degenerate Still ahead of my PC cost lol
Then leave the subreddit
OP has just gotten a 4090 context 1 This comment aged like milk
But your choices are
Jensen tmr Anything below XX80 is a story in the past introducing RTX 3680 4G RTX 3680 6G RTX 3680 Ti 6G RTX 4080 8G RTX 4080 Ti 8G
rebranded the 4070 4060
Hearing their investor meeting pretty much confirms this Jensen outlined the strategy is to price position current gen products to prepare for next generation
3000 series instead at a cheaper price Then in 3 months time when the 3000 series stock is gone nvidia say LOOK We've dropped our prices for the 4000 series An no one gives a shit because they've just got a very capable 3000 series card for cheap
From a purely business perspective it's great Many will do the following 1 Look at the price of the 4080 16GB and say 'well if I'm spending 1200 on a GPU I may as well spend 1600 for a better one' NVIDIA increases ASP and upsells someone 2 Look at the price of RTX 40 cards and say they will buy a discount RTX 30 card instead They help NVIDIA shift stock of Ampere cards which they desperately want to sell If Lovelace sells well keep the high prices If Lovelace doesn't sell well wait for option 2 to kick in and enough RTX 30 stock to go and then price cut RTX 40 cards
Why would I not just buy an AMD card instead They are highly overvaluing their brand at this point I'm done after all this chip shortage bullshit We're much more in the clear now and the CEO says this dumb shit No more money from 's a relationship stretching over a decade
no but it is why i will be buying some version of AMD this
This is also so that if people don't buy 4000 series enough they can drop the price a little bit and say look it's on sale Even if it still costs more than it should have in the first place
I mean it s not the silliest idea I had this idea about the 40 series as well and it seems I made a statement that came true They are inflating the absolute hell out of this price to push the remaining stock of 30 series then once that is gone 40 series will start to drop and Jensen will change his tune I don't think he realizes though that the 30 series will still be more than good enough for the next year or so so when Jensen has to bow down to investors for the 3rd 4th quarter of the 40 series release his head is going to roll and I'm sure prices are going to drop drastically Investors don't give a damn about anything else but numbers If your CEO strategy isn't working in high prices the answer is simple Get another strategy or we get another CEO
It's working I'm fixing to buy an RX 6800 for 400 bucks and skip Nvida all together this time Let them sit on that inventory for a long time
They make some money from early adopters I'll admit I've been a sucker for early adopter PC parts but am totally off the 40 series train This feels worse than when the 20 series came out
If this is the case ideally they'd lower the 4000 prices after they sell off most of the 3000 stock This would totally bone anyone who bought either series cards though I sure hope this isn't how it's playing out because then we're screwed either way
It isn't if they lived in a bubble and everyone forgot about this shit they are 's just a measure of analysing the risk in brand being tarnished for a while and the economic impact that has over selling all current gen stuff
and yet they locked DLSS3 0 to the new cards only its still silly
The only reason I was originally going to pass on the 4000 series was the assumed high power draw but that turned out to be overblown But seeing these prices Hell no I know EVGA isn't our friend as they're a company but when they'd rather just get out all together than put up with nvidia's 's pretty damn telling of nvidia's ethics or lack of I hope AMD is able to do what they did to Intel to nvidia I'm NOT a fangirl of AMD but nvidia needs competition It made Intel better it can hopefully make nvidia better I also hope Intel doesn't give up on GPUs but I'm afraid they already have I hope I am proven wrong though
People always hate on me for this but when supply is limited I much prefer high prices than bots and eBay shenanigans At least with true pricing for demand everyone gets an equal shot at it not just the people who make a sophisticated business out of beating everyone else to the limited stock Let Nvidia lower the price when they no longer sell out The market for 1200 GPUs isn't that big Nvidia can satisfy it before too long The opposite is what we see with PS5 where it's still out of stock 2 years after release
No they lowered the 3000 series to a very specific price so it could exist at the same time as the 4000 series that way people can't complain about the redicilous 4000 series prices
Why would they prioritize selling the 3000 series over the 4000 series This is just the price that Nvidia thinks is reasonable for the new cards
This would make the most sense considering the amount of overstock NVIDIA and Retailers have due to the mining boom that has died out since Dec 2021
Jensen already said in the investors call iirc that they already have a plan or plans in place how the RTX 30xx and the 40xx series can co exist we just saw plan A
They did say they were doing that
It's crazy though the pretend 4080 is going to cost a few hundred more than a 3080 12 GB at roughly the same performance
so that people would buy 3000 series instead at a cheaper price Well we can nip that in the bud by not doing this either 30 series at MSRP after two years isn't a good deal and we shouldn't accept it Hell many 30 series cards are still above MSRP in many areas They've gotta lower prices Until then we shouldn't buy anything
we saw this coming tbh as soon as prices skyrocket thanks to mining and pandemic combined
It isn't but I don't think they will lower these prices There is a huge cap between the 4090 and the 4080
I was able to get a 3070 on launch at MSRP but I really wanted a 3080 I was going thinking of buying a 4080 this gen but for 1200 bucks I can almost build an entirely new computer For the 1600 bucks of the 4090 I can actually build an entirely new computer
Aren t they like twice three times as fast You don t need the latest generation but it seems a steal if the price isn t three times higher either Everyone just needs to chill it s ok not to want something It s not 2003 anymore
That is exactly what they want people to do buy up an older nvidia card before AMD releases their new stuff
Until they see they've pissed off everyone and the potential buyers just say screw it and wait for the next good one that isn't NVIDIA
Cause he keeps talking about Omniverse
I work in pricing Analytics can confirm
I've been pondering this for a while It's like publicly traded companies are viruses and they must continue to grow until the host is dead We made 2 trillion dollars last year Better do better this year or we've failed Eventually they stop making more money by offering innovative new products and services and have to turn to screwing the customer As soon as you see a company start to do things like not including a charger changing certain things to a subscription model that didn't used to be etc you know they're out of ideas Not only does this model mean all businesses eventually turn to shit pay staff less starting merging and buying up all competition and products turn to shit it's also the primary means for how the rich get richer The investment economy is great at rapidly starting up a new company giving it the resources it needs to create and getting the product out to the entire world quickly It is not good however for sustaining these things It's like taking a steroid pill that will rapidly make you stronger and perform better but eventually kills you I don't know much about the details of these things but it seems like every company eventually reaches a point where they are offering their best product at their most cost effective means to the largest market they can There is a limit for growth but our economic model does not allow for that I'm not sure what the solution for that would be I know eventually big companies tend to buy their stocks back maybe the government needs to be a part of that too It's like corporations eventually need to return to being private until they can somehow prove that they once again need public investment in order to expand into something else with a clear definitive plan Because as it stands right now constantly being expected to return higher profits to the shareholder becomes a cancer that trickles down to all parts of society
NVDA is in trouble imo They re over valued even by comparison to other companies given their rev etc Their AI growth and server growth haven t been sector movers and certainly aren t helping to make up that 2b hole that miners left them I m curious if they were able to change their chip order numbers I never saw any follow up Looking at the 4090 and 4080 prices it screams panic and pray The other thing is who is buying these cards for 1080 1440 gaming No one needs 500 fps
People want to invest in a total market fund and have their money go up It's a flawed system to it's core
It's comical how upvoted your comment is when the subject of it is a company that has diversified in the past few years to the extent that their AI division gives them more money than the gaming business they started off with Doesn't look like it's getting saturated any time soon The AI business in turn grew up in a duration with almost a static population How could this be Infinite growth The mind boggles And as a side note the people might be finite and even decreasing for that matter but the valuation isn't So the money does have to come from somewhere Now back in 2008 some wiseguy thinking in a similar vein as you though with far more complexity and exasperated at how our rulers the government was printing billions willy nilly came up with an algorithm that became another booming business for this very same public company leading us to the situation that is today since that business has gone bust For now
mega corps will keep scalping people If they're selling their own product it is not scalping
Maybe if federal governments grew some fucking cojones and actually took these companies to task instead of taking their money to the bank things will change
Makes you wonder what numbers they're actually basing this shit off doesn't it Because these clowns are obviously not looking at the same charts we all are Its like they have a fairytale book for marketing or something Sure it works short term but short term good tends to lead to long term bad
The problem is the fact that the stocks always have to go up in order for the shareholders to make a profit If the company is doing the same as the time the shareholders bought the stocks then the stocks are worth the same If the companies payed dividends more frequently we'd probably see this change a bit because now you wouldn't need record growths every quarter as you would earn money from dividends You'd be interested in keeping the stock price above what you payed for but you wouldn't care nearly as much to get it as high as possible It's all a big pyramid scheme you depend on selling the stock to someone for a higher price in order to earn money than he does the same and the circle continues It doesn't matter how much the company earns what matters is how much it is worth prime example is Tesla
A system of infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is not sustainable
Not only that publicly traded companies are REQUIRED to be evil Legally contractually If there's a way to make the company more money regardless if it's evil or not consumer friendly or it's gonna hurt their public image or their legacy the investors board can require the company to do so Because it is obligated to take every opportunity to return the maximum amount of money possible to its investors or it can be sued for cessation of profit This is how broken the system is
Financial Analyst here Been saying this for years and no one seems to understand
Corps can keep growing at least at the population growth rate indefinitely If there's 2 more people each year you can reasonably expect the minimum baseline growth to be 2
Every single public company expect infinite growth from a finite population This is also true for consumers though people expect infinite progress always at the same rate with limited laws of physics and can't seem to contemplate even for a second diminishing returns when you approach the physical limits even if the investment required and hence the money the company needs to make back is the same or even higher
Boy have I sure got a manifesto for you
Let's not forget that we're headed into a global recession on top of the housing crisis the energy crisis and the exploding cost of living Consumers are shifting their spending habits to prioritize the rent groceries gas etc High end GPUs are not going to take priority over those things for most people
For some reason the world just keeps churning out fresh adults each year who want nice shiny things No one has yet come up with an acceptable solution to that problem
Isn't late stage capitalism the best
Here's the thing though nobody is forcing abyone to buy these products Prices will keep gpong up as long as demand exists
from a finite population Population and money supply are still growing right now Come back when that changes
Living in the metaverse lol
At least it s a monthly salary in some countries that s half a year worth of salaries
They're filthy rich tech bros They seriously think they just get whatever they throw a tantrum about because so far it's usually true Fuck them and their overpriced garbage
The more GPUs you buy the more money you save Jensen
With inflation i hope Nvidia gets a taste of their own medicine so to they will probably just end up with more stock
If you re making 900 a month chances are you re not in a bleeding edge brand new miniaturized supercomputer seller s mind
Welcome to third world countries this has been like this for us since forever
Short sighted They re putting the 4000 series at this price point to incentivize buyers to clear out the old 3000 series inventory The buyers think they re outsmarting NVIDEA while the company gets to dump already paid for inventory These 4000 prices having nothing to do with selling 4000 cards
Yep Its a waiting game The prices will tank in 2 3 months unless there s another crypto boom
Honestly disgracing the name of Ada Lovelace
Was upgrading ever gen a normal thing
NVIDIA is a full skip for me Time to see what AMD is all about
I remember that and I'm thinking the same Reality is I have a 3070 I got it for a decent price considering the climate at the 'm good Unless AMD produce a stonking product and price I'm good for now Nvidia made a killing during the Bitcoin super rush which is fine what big corporation wouldn't but NOW they're having to take some losses after over ordering slightly and are trying to tell gamers the regular customers to just deal with it after they've waited in line for so long Nah I say hold your wallets purses and let them burn They can't let that inventory sit in storage forever AMD will take advantage of this to what extent I don't know Will they undercut by 10 bucks 20 bucks 50 100 more 's up to them what they do I don't need to upgrade but if AMD do offer a good performance hike from last gen for a good price I'll buy one out of principle
I'm really curious for November 3rd
I'm not expecting AMD to be some Knight in Shinning Armor I wouldn't be surprised to see them go full heel either lmao
I assure you the chip pricing increases dont remotely come close to the pricing increases Nvidia are putting on us
It honestly just feels like they priced the 4000 series high so that people would buy 3000 series instead at a cheaper price GTX 1060 on your 's almost 8 years since we had a decent mid range GPU for 200
AMD is in a beautiful position Undercut nvidia slightly whilst increasing price compared to last gen Reap the benefits of a duopoly and gamers still perceive you as a saviour ignoring the fact that you re a public company whose sole purpose is to maximise profit for shareholders
let's see if that's the case then PC Gaming is dead for a while Exact same thing that happened before the 360 PS3 boom that resulted in almost a decade of barely anyone gaming on PC It won't matter that a few people can still afford it if the majority of gaming culture moves to console it will be hard to get them back It took a lot of work from a lot of people to make PC Gaming as popular as it is today
I don't bother with AMD cards always got Nvidia so I thought I'd check the price of the current AMD GPUs They're roughly the same as the Nvidia counterparts slightly lower in some cases People on here thinking AMD are going to be some kind of saviour are kidding themselves
To be fair AMD is theoretically in a prime position here They are on a cheaper node N5 vs N4 and their GPU's should be cheaper to make due to the chiplet design They don't really need to be the outright best GPU's They just need to be faster than the previous gen by a decent margin and priced acordingly Now whether AMD seizes this moment and disrupts the market or just undercuts by 50 100 and reaps the profits while not actually increasing their reach is to be seen
AMD didnt start the scalping though they just follow the
The reason people hope for that is because AMD Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 series CPU price are cheaper than previous gen CPU
I think that it is ok to be optimistic because we literally do not know what they are doing yet People were optimistic about nVidia until the announcement
Linus Torvalds is that you
Just like those poor indie devs Nintendo
Bingo But it won t be an artificial slow down it will be then just making more expensive A100s for AWS and AZURE
I wouldn't trust Nvidia not to jack up the price of that too
These cards are going to sell out on launch day I wish they wouldn't but they will
TSMC increased prices a 20 The RTX 4080 12GB aka RTX 4070 renamed has almost a 100 price increase from last gen I know it was a Samsung node but whatever And Nvidia has been making fucking tons of money this past years selling the GPUs at absurd prices thanks to the global supply crisis
i m not trying be a r HailCorporate type but companies are always trying to cut costs stabbing another business in the back for another is just nVidia finding ways to get their product made lower costs nVidia is a customer from TSMC point of view same as Samsung if Samsung was able to provide what nVidia wants then they get the business from nVidia also many businesses use all of these other manufactures at the same time for various parts i wouldn t be surprised that nVidia is still using TSMC for other things
Exactly which is why it's all fun and games to laugh at Intel's woes by saying Intel 10nm lmao until you get shafted by a dominant TSMC Nvidia is going to want to keep or increase their margins too so they'll double f k us with another price hike Which is what's happening right now
Yep People responding in this thread have practically no reading comprehensive skills
Did you notice this generation is 5nm instead of 8nm previous generation With smaller chip size and also considering TSMC defect per sqcm is much lower than Samsung for 5nm is only 0 01 more than their own 8nm I'm assuming there will be more chips yield on each wafer which means price increase from TSMC carried to consumer cannot be more than 0 01 Also since nvidia produced their previous generation chips with samsung and not TSMC so I don't think they were entitled for discount I'm assuming TSMC was still cheaper than Samsung that nvidia decided to change sides Note that TSMC increased their prices per wafer by up to 9 2022 6 2023
Honestly TSMC need to be broken up It's beyond ridiculous that the entire world's supply of chips comes from one company
Lol bootlicker
No he s absolutely wrong If you compare costs pre and post Covid it s clear the reason it costs more is because they are still working through demand form Covid Higher demand with lower supply means higher prices Like his statements don t even pass the sniff test It s all bullshit NVIDIA is now SUPER OVERVALUED especially with etherium moved to proof of stake They won t even come close to hitting Covid GPU numbers Consumers don t need new GPUS and the big boys like Amazon and azure buy the expensive shit and get discounts for volume
Bruh this is what I been saying I got a 3080 to play Overwatch and doom
Wondering the same thing What the hell is compelling about dropping 2K just to get 96 fps in cyberpunk And when did broken ass games become the measuring stick
Their pricing is rooted in the idea crypto is still alive Guess they missed the memo and market signals that started back in checks notes March
I got a 1080 for like 150 a while back and it s fantastic for what I play these days Can t see myself ever needing too much more as an adult if I m spending a grand on something it s sure as heck not going to be a gpu
The idea isn t of the past but the purchasing is
Only it's not 2x 4x faster like they're claiming They're using their frame interpolation tech ie fake frames as leverage to make these claims It's misleading at best The 4090 is more like 50 60 faster than the 3090 in traditional rasterization
Good thing the only use for GPU chips is gaming Great comment
But much worse
This is what I find hilarious They're not getting my money and I would like an upgrade using a 970 currently and have plenty of money to buy one I recognize there will be people who purchase but if they're not able to get me to upgrade when I need it they're not where they think they are IMO We shall see
last gen was artificially high cos of miners net profit margins
Well since he's talking about the chip production and Nvidia and AMD both use TSMC for that switching isn't the deal you think it is
Are you using 4k 1440p Are you trying to push high refresh rates At 1440p I can tell you there are a lot of games that can't hit 144 FPS with a 3080 Ti FTW3 If you're playing at 60hz with 1440p or 1080p then yeah current gen is fine At 1440p high refresh rate or 4k with or without high refresh rate the 40 series is welcome price aside
I think I could make a PC that matches the PS5 for 600 fairly easily
Still doesn't justify Nvidia's prices
At least not to the degree that people act like And on top R D is more expensive because of moorse law dying They are inflating prices to some degree sure theyre a business But I wish everyone would stop acting like they work there and they actually know what is going on Theres a lot of overhead and expenses that come with developing tech like this and theyre always branching out into stuff like rtx dlss etc
where have i heard this 2000 3000 seem gamers have poor memory
Next generation you be saying that same thing for 350 GPUs The 4090 is not the problem it's the 4080 16gb and 12gb that's the issue everyone is talking about But it may be simply Nvidia set the value high because they don't want you to buy these yet suggesting you to buy 30xx family They may adjust the price appropriately when the 30xx over supply is gone
Yall are holding on to the days of 200 gpus and those are never coming back I have an RX6600 I picked up for 210 new adjusted for inflation that's like 160 in 2016 money Runs cyberpunk at 1440p60 with reasonable settings That's the worst running title out right now so that's all the GPU anybody really needs for 1080 1440 for the rest of this console generation
The RTX3000 series are far from amazing at the current prices At my country the RTX 3060 Ti's are still being sold higher than the MSRP two years after their release Both generetions are very high priced right now and a terrible buy option And we still don't have a proper and modern midrange card for 250 since the RX580 and the GTX 1060 six years later
Your understanding of economics is laughably pitiful The bill of sales is a fraction of the cost of any real item there is no possible way in any reality that these cards should cost more when their total supply of cards is overflowing so badly they need to introduce the 4070 as a fake 4080 just so they can sell the massive backlog of 3000 series cards You REALLY UNIRONICALLY think that a tanker ship full of gpus getting stuck all of china shutting down and the worst pandemic in several hundred years all at their peak should not be the peak price point for these electronics And no we are not short on silicon car manufacturers are The gpu industry has plenty more than they did during peak covid season
A reasonable increase to keep pace with inflation is justified Nearly doubling the price of the fake 4070 and actual 4080 is not It's pure greed and an insult to the consumer
It's weird that the prices for new gens of other components aren't skyrocketing like this
I hope Intel pushes through a couple of non exciting gens and becomes a third serious player in the GPU market down the road
The real 4080 is a step down from 3080 it's not even using the top end die The gap between 4080 and 4090 is so much larger this gen than last I really think they did the whole scam 12gb 4080 thing to distract people from how shit a deal the real 4080 is
RT isn't really that important for gaming You can max out settings and have a very good experience regardless of RT It's more of a nice to have cool if you got an OLED or an HDR panel that plays nice with Windows HDR most of the time I see it making everything dimmer still
Of course I dont see gamers having the cahones to hodl We actually have more leverage in this market opposite of what others are saying we need an army of people yelling this from soapboxes in r hardware buildapc etc though from what i've seen anti nvidia sentiment is already spread
nvidia offering all these cheat mode rendering settings isn't helping optimization devs can just throw fsr dlss2 on their game and overcome any GPU bottleneck Now they can throw dlss3 and overcome CPU bottleneck to the tune of 2x fps
Dungeons and Dragons will surely be getting more of my money
No we won't No one has good jobs anymore The economy is crashing The next Great Depression is days away Nvidia won't be selling chit at that price
Its not ok and they wont just like they didnt buy out the 3000 ti stock
I sure won't be going there AMD all the way
In almost the exact same boat as you basically same specs I wanted to get a 4080 to take full advantage of my 1440p 21 9 175hz display There is no way in hell I'm supporting these business practices Probably gonna buy a used 3080 non mined
I once had that thought about the housing 's always someone out there with a crap load of cash no matter the state of the economy
There were people buying 3070 3090 for 2 4x the retail price There are going to be people who buy these gpus on launch day asap especially scalpers who will make things worse
Dude we're 6 months into the recession already
There are tens of millions of very well paid people that would be willing to pay those prices especially those in the professional market where those prices are bargains compared to what Nvidia charges for Quadros My guess is that the average person is expected to buy last generation cards
no way in hell those 1k cards will fly off the shelves Assuming only 300 of profit for each card they only need to sell few millions to make immense bucks Friendly reminder that Nvidia has had among the highest net profits of all the companies in tech often with net profits being in excess of 25 of their entire income and that includes research staffing sales departments administration and cost of chips If only one person out of 20 in the world is a pc gamer and of those pc gamers only one in 50 will buy those cards you're still looking at 8 million GPUs sold and a net profit of more than 2B just with 4080 and 4090 Nvidia isn't stupid They want to max revenues not total sales number They know they will sell millions of those super priced GPUs and that't the end of the story
Flirting with a recession Sure the US gov doesn t call it one but we re at 2 quarters in a row with negative GDP By definition this is a recession The definition that all banks lenders and the finance industry as a whole has been using for years
The type of person that pays 1 000 for a graphics card likely has not been impacted greatly by the economic downturn I still expect these to sell out quickly but they may need to lower their prices in order to continue to sell them Only time will tell though
I want to see it before I believe it I have grown cynical
I think you meant depression
He already told CNBC that Nvidia is expecting limited sales if the 40 series for a couple of quarters I think they have made a conscientious decision to limit supplies and are setting the prices in accordance
Nobody should be buying a 2080 2090 for gaming Buy a PS5 and call it a day 4090 is cheap if your job relies on Cuda Cores It's a professionals card
The unfortunate part about all of this is he's not off base I just read an article that the next big jump to 2 3nm is going to be even more expensive We're just moving in the direction that even a modest top tier rig in the next few years is going to start at 3 4k It doesn't mean everything is going to be wildly more expensive just the barrier of entry to be top of the line is going to burn the wallet significantly harder
Recession is even worse in Europe euro lost 20 of its value and that 20 goes to these new GPU prices Reference 4090 is 1999 euros My salary per month is close to that Im not gonna work a month and use everything on some fancy new GPU
You're not flirting with recession you're in one lmao
The cards will sell like hotcakes Nvidia targets enterprise not gamers
Idk 1599 isn't a bad price for a next gen flagship It's like the old Titan days I was just hoping that the 4090 will be a real difference over my 3090 Kingpin or 3090 Ti Kingpin
Scalpers will keep buying them especially during the start People will buy them the only thing we can hope for is that not enough people will buy them We don't know the production capacity maybe Nvidia is not producing enough to keep the prices high and volume low
Exactly and that s their current strategy Their main focus is making as much as they can from the 3000 series They know the 4000 series is overpriced but they also know plenty of people will still buy them Most people that can t get a 4080 or refuse to pay that much will end up buying a 3080 or 3090 It s a win win for Nvidia unless people switch to AMD or just sit the generation out
You can be sure the cards will instantly sell out The real question is if consumers will continue to justify the actions of scalpers by buying from them when they ve cornered the market
Add in the fact crypto mining is unprofitable and they won t sell 10 of them
I was just I wonder if in 2030's people will look back and remember these expressive GPUs in a similar way A
Were in the early stages of recession it's going to get a lot worse thr next 2 years
I feel like nvidia has no clue about the market they are in crypto miners are on hiatus EVGA news is creating doubt with consumers 30xx cards are plentiful now AAA Games are flopping due to poor execution And then there's a recession looming They just sound tone dead
Of course they will Consumers are too easily tempted to resist even when it's in their best interest
I can t guess the numbers on it but the Ethereum fork makes those pricier cards harder to sell My 3090 paid for my whole computer in 2020 A 4090 might pay for it s taxing and shipping in 2023
It's a pretty good incentive to get rid of any 30XX cards in stock If in fact this is because the cards simply cost that more to make well then consumers will have to get used to it and be OK with a generation behind if they can't afford the latest If its just due to greed and people can't buy the cards because they're out of price we'll quickly find out how fast the price points fall If AMD's RDNA cards are of similar power but heaps cheaper then we'll see how much the NVIDIA ecosystem will continue to drive sales
Why do you think they raised prices They're not going for volume sales here They're keeping the 40 series expensive so most people buy 30 series in higher volume There are plenty of people with enough money to buy the 40 series right now they want 30 series in more PCs Honestly RTX Remix alone has me sticking with nvidia this gen I know nvidia is a total diva but God damn do they make some amazing stuff
You underestimate gamers outside of reddit The 4090 will fly off the shelves Gaming as a hobby is still cheaper than most hobbies
Maybe they will fly off the shelves at least initially and then scalpers will be left holding the bag when no one wants to buy them on the 2nd hand market
We're flirting with recession at least in the US 1k cards will fly off the shelves we were having huge layoffs during covid and the demand was incredible x200B doesnt matter if we have a recession Gaming is mainstream and even with mining off the table the cards are used for other things too there will be enough people who can buy it no problem x200B people were paying 1500 for PS5s 1200 for 6800XTs and 3080s last
Yea for whatever reason there are alotof people with a lot of cash I thought shit was going to be fucked by now but here we are Every hobby I m in things are sold out on new release constantly This 40 series is going to be sold out on release If I m wrong I ll hold this L and be happy to do it
Guaranteed every new 1k card is going to fly off shelves especially during the holiday season The type of person who is affected enough by a recession to start limiting unnecessary spending isn't one that would buy a 1k gpu to begin with
Recession is full on here an has been for the last 4 months Same in EU
We ain't flirting with recession we are flirting with a crisis that makes 2008 look tame
I know this comment is old but GPU's are still selling decently And Nvidia keeps releasing the worst GPU stack I have ever seen I mean each 4000 release is basically an upsell to get the next one above It is so low AMD isn't much better though it seems the 7900XTX has some value if you can find it
Their strategy seems to be kicking the can further down the road by shifting the market away from gamers and into developers data centers others The question of who will buy their cards is indeed relevant However given Jensen's last broadcast he clearly isn't marketing towards gamers
What I don't understand is why does he need to keep high margins when the market is very different from 2 years ago If what you're saying is true then this is just one last cash grab before he retires and it's almost criminal
4nm wafers probably north of 20k AD102 is 608mm 2
Aren't we reaching the bottle cap at witch transistors perform 4090 is just like buy last of us for the third remaster just to get higher facial details If a 4060 can do that why drop the cash for it
AFAIK EVGA was a reseller and got much lower margins since they dont manufacture themselfs The poor RMA rates with the past GPUs did not help and failures in high end GPU designs New World 3090 cost them clearly a lot with a very high amount of replacements And while all of this could have been still profitable for EVGA they added their super mega upgrade program on top of that If the 10 margin AIB's that directly manufacture the NVIDIA GPU's and keep their RMA rates very low HAVE TO QUIT the GPU market that would be a big issue EVGA is a really bad example since budget cuts with manufacturing and design of the cards backfired multiple times and thats on them cant blame NVIDIA for bad weather The glorified evga 3080 ftw3 ultra had like 9 revision just to solve the power issues of the GPU That did for sure not help with their margins lets blame NVIDIA for that aswell
NVIDIA absolutely does not have 60 margins They usually operate around 25 and 35 Last quarter they had their worst quarter since 2011 in terms of margins at just 10
He is 59 and still pationate no way he retires before his late 60s
Based on the last decade of releases next gen is 2 years away Jensen won't retire in 2024 No way in hell
For NV this kicks the can down the road On the next gen of NV cards NV will probably have to start cutting into it's own margins to generate sales Jensen will likely retire before next generation though I think Jensen's goal is to win the AI hardware war and have being a GPU company be a secondary thing AI hardware is going to be huge as it can do more things for businesses and Nvidia seems to have a genuine edge over everyone else People tend to use Nvidia's datacenter GPUs to train AI models and we are just on the cusp of a huge AI revolution Look at midjourney Dall E2 and stable diffusion Now imagine that starting to be applied to other parts of businesses AI figuring out how to schedule your employees predicting markets finding employees ect You can charge absurd amounts of money to businesses because if an datacenter GPU makes you 2M you will not hesitate to pay 1M for it
Not sure about the bankruptcy MSI Gigabyte and Asus could do fine without GPUs if the margins are really as low as they appear Are Zotac and Palit next I really don't see it in the next year but if Nvidia doesn't back off of vertical integration by the end of this generation they may not be able to justify staying in the business And Nvidia will not miss them because they would then have more room for product segmentation without having to worry about pesky AIBs offering a better value BOM if Nvidia wants to sell a higher clocked version for 500 more
Nvidia must produce the largest chips it can because GPU performance scales linearly with chip size And this is where MCM technologies are really going to shine Why make a 608 mm 2 monolithic die when you can make it as four 152 mm 2 dies and have a much lower defect rate due to the small die size You also get far more options when it comes to selling GPUs as you can do your entire lineup using the same lithography pattern and using different amounts of dies per SKU and even cut down the defective dies for when you don't want need a full die In other words increasing wafer costs are not going to hit AMD anywhere near as hard as it is hitting Nvidia due to AMD using a MCM setup on their high end GPUs The only question is whether their interconnect technology is up to the task
Good explanation Thanks This is all just part of his exit strategy to pick up bloated bonuses at everyone else's expense
I will just buy a 3080 which is very capable of playing any games I want on high framerate on 1440p for the next 4 5 years 3080 is best for anyone at this point at a lower price unless your a super high end gamer
So you'll just give them slightly less money I'm sure they'll be very upset
That's actually Nvidia's plan JSH pretty much said that to Jim Kramer on CNBC They are making very few of the 40 series cards and setting prices high to clear out the 30 series supply
I will just buy a 3080 which is very capable For a second there I thought the 3080 had come down to a reasonable price Nope still 1000 Seems like the new normal of pricing is working
And that gpu will be twice as much because graphics card prices wont drop
Agreed And the timing of launch of the 5XXX series will be much better Right now a 3080 is a plenty powerful card to play AAA games especially with DLSS The card was slightly ahead of its time in 2020 and has held up 2 years later If they launched the 3080 today people would be buying it without question due to its performance Once 2 more years passes and the 5XXX series launches only then will upgrading for better performance be worth it
I invested in a 3080 I managed to grab one before scalpers I fully plan on it lasting for the next 4 5 years as well I saw the prices of the new cards and this statement by the CEO and I have to say I'm disgusted in all honesty I'll absolutely be looking into AMD cards down the line because of this which I hope they also don't price out of ridiculousness too
Yeah Advanced games drive high end graphics card sales just like crypto currency miners do If crypto doesn't need these cards and there aren't any games that require them then the 4090 is relegated back to the market where such leading edge cards lived 10 years You are excited about and that B Will actually need the processing power of these newer cards
My EVGA 3080 does 4k pretty well too newer AAA titles you need to drop the quality a bit but overall I have been happy with it for the last 2 years Then again I only play singleplayer games I don't plan on upgrading anytime soon but if I have to I think I'll go with an AMD PowerColor Red Devil card
Not happening For better value likely but not for less money
they have at least a year's worth of 30 series stock in warehouses they can't offload they want you to do this that's the whole point just wait for amd's cards you could easily get 4080 performance for half the price even less than 3080s are now
Just got a 4K tv 120 hz my 3080 pushing hard loudly crying face
I will just buy a 3080 which is very capable of playing any games I want on high framerate on 1440p for the next 4 5 years I've been using a 3080 FE on a 4k 120hz and 4k 144hz monitor for almost two years and its been perfect The absolute soonest I will consider an upgrade is the 5000 series and I won't be surprised if this card lasts me even longer than that The 3080 is an absolute beast of a card and it'll take a while for software to catch up
This might be where the market is trending where the vast majority of people who would have bought a current gen card will just shift to buying a previous gen card each cycle So not buy a 4080 until the 5080 or even 6080 is released and buy it on discount Honestly even though technically each new generation is 2 to 4 times faster than the last generation for the typical consumer they are never going to realize this difference in performance between one or even two successive generations I mean how many people out there are still rocking 1000 series cards at 1080p with recently released games and are perfectly happy with them I was one of those that went from a 1070 to a 3080 and that 1070 did me well for the better part of a decade
You re still giving Nvidia your money
That's exactly what nvidia wants buy 2 year old tech that we have the warehouses full of for the full price please
Wait until Nvidia pays for half of the AAA game studios to use raytracing exclusively
My friend messaged me yesterday saying he wanted help with getting a 3080 Where I live 3080tis are the same price 740 Can t predict the future so dont know what s going to happen with 40 series But like you said 3080 will be plenty capable for 4 5 years and i think it will age well
In 2 years from now they will release a gpu with twice the performance of the 4090 for less money That's a good point
Smart man beaming face with smiling eyes People act like a 6700 xt 350 rtx 3070 rx 6800 can't game at 1440p You can get an rx 6600 xt and max out 1080p for like 250 or grab a rtx 3060 2070 2080 5700 xt still work A 1080 is still hanging in there today Tons of gpu's are out there that can get the job done and they are getting cheaper atm If someone has a 6900 xt 6800 xt 3090 3080 3070 ti 6800 I think they are more than fine
with an abysmal 128 bit memory bus lmao
GTX 4080 3GB
Thanks for the laugh
I'm thinking more like 5 15 People don't seem to understand that TSMC really jacked up costs this time around AMD is going chiplet so that could cut chip fab cost by as much as 25 amd they're using cheaper GDDR6 instead of GDDR6X but that only translates to about 100 or 200 difference on the 3 highest end cards
Not really TSMC has a new fab spooling up in Arizona It'll be at 100 production by end of 2023 which is around the same time the 40 series will likely see anprice drop That fab will handle production of chips on 4N and 5nm After that happens China invading Taiwan will only majorly affect supply of chips on 3nm and smaller nodes That's also the reason why Apple's A16 was originally supposed to be a 3nm SoC but ended up being a 5nm
7970 really had some staying power Used one in a budget build about a year ago and it was still pretty good for 1080p
Not to mention that the enthusiast segment was buying two of these cards to run in SLI That s how I look at the 3090 4090 an SLI alternative
Didn t the Titan cost like 999 which would be like 1300 or something now Equivalent in the lineup to a 3090 4090 So some price increases especially the 4000 series but the 3090 is a comparatively good deal nowadays
Punch the RTX 4080 12GB numbers into a performance calculator and you realistically get xx60 Ti card rather than an XX80
Why the heck are you getting downvoted Are facts so threatening to people in this types of subs
Mate a RTX 3080 10 GB was 699 at launch I actually got my 3080 TUF for 762 includes 20 VAT They could absolutely sell 40 series for half the price and still make a profit but they smelled scalper and mining prices and now want to keep them up A 980 Ti was 649 a 1080 Ti was 699 a 2080 Ti was the first time they really tried to push price to 999 and it didn't sell that well RTX 3080 was 699 again the 3090 is a Titan card which was originally 999 and is mostly for content creators with its 24 GB VRAM You are out of your mind if you think over 1000 is reasonable for a GPU you use for gaming
I've seen a few used 5700XTs pop up at 200 250
Unless you play with GPU's of the past
Yeah it's fucking insane what NVIDIA is pulling here when I look at my rig I built 5 years ago What I Used Price I paid Current Comparable What it Costs i7 7700K 370 i7 12000K 400 itx mobo 190 itx mobo 200 2x16gb DDR4 250 2x16 DDR5 200 500gb NVMe 300 500gb NVMe 50 1080TI 700 4080 16GB 1200 I likely built my whole PC for what Nvidia is going to charge for a 4080TI Inflation yada yada I get that but the CPU went up 7 5 The mobo went up 5 RAM dropped by 25 NVMes are 1 6th the cost But the Nvidia GPU 100 increase 1080 was 600 just looked it up What a fucking scam by Nvidia and yah it's causing me a PC gamer my whole life to go hm maybe I need to take an actual look at consoles for the first time in almost 20
I don't think so For one indie games are a hugely important to the demographic For another AAA devs aren't going to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into exclusively supporting hardware that 1 of their customer base actually own Hell I feel like AMD could back off of future focused hardware R D at this point and still capture a major portion of the market Also Intel will allegedly be an option some day soon I do not think other GPU manufacturers are dumb enough to follow this trend to the letter No one should need a 300 watt gpu to play video games and few people are going to spend the money on it in the current economic downturn As someone with money to throw around who's getting older the 3080 might just be my last high end video card Unless something happens it's certainly my last Nvidia card
That's the scary part The 4090 Sure it's acceptable since it has always been the flagship top tier I'm actually surprised it wasn't more The 4080 16GB and 4080 12GB 1 Fuck those prices Not even remotely acceptable let alone decent or dare say good You basically need to drop the 4080 12GB 1 by at least 250 and the 16GB by 350 400 for the prices to be decent Still not good but better than acceptable I don't know anyone that is willing to spend 1k on a GPU That's easily enthusiast level with money to blow Even 800 900 is essentially enthusiast level Everyone I know generally spends 600 700 at most 1 4070
They're gonna be pushing folks to console gaming for sure like the 4080 16gb at msrp is at 1199 here in my country the starting price is at 1440 I could buy 3 ps5s for that price
This is how they are going to push for GeForce now By making hardware gradually overpriced
people will shift for cheaper amd cards since nvidia won't manufacture cheap models anymore then everyone except the industry will use amd everything i said is true and real
Nah We'll adapt As we always do
Yep and that s what they want Rest assured any company working on AI right now don t want you to own a computer capable of running it ever An AI powerful enough to make software design hardware and use a 3D printer will one day render all these companies obsolete They re legally required to prevent that if they can anticipate it How the hell do they do that They push to kill the home computer and try really hard to convince people that streaming games is the future That way they can offer AI as a service that you could never own yourself and have full control over what you are actually allowed to do with that AI That why you see companies like Microsoft and Google pushing hard for streaming services while NVidia starts doing more business directly with server companies and crypto farms
Underrated comment PC gaming is becoming a rich man s game An entry level GPU alone is going to cost you the same as a PS5
True And oddly I don't see the huge leaps forwards that PCs used to offer that would justify the cost I remember bitterly wishing my console could run Crysis What's even the modern equivalent of that
I waited through pandemic to finally upgrade my 1070ti to a 3080ti when I got a deal on an Amazon return 700 Then I noticed it didn't give me that much difference in the games I played except a lot more heat I sold that thing for what I paid and went back to 1070ti Actually I barely touched my gaming pc anymore Not bc I stopped playing but because I'm gaming on steam deck Pc gaming may very evolve from what we know especially when gpu manufacturers keep pulling these stunts
lol be careful what you say of r PCMasterRace is going come after you
For the ultra high end AAA games maybe But it isn't a one company market People need to actually be willing to buy an AMD GPU instead of Nvidia to teach Nvidia a lesson That's only if AMD keeps prices reasonable and performance justifies it though of course
Be honest 's worth hardware 't just a port of a console game at this
I dunno let's go back in time 20 years when high end pc gaming cost even more than it does now inflation adjusted and it was still pretty popular It's just that for the last 6 or 7 years we've experienced PC gaming at all time levels of cheap and they're going up again now but it will just end up back where it was before it got stupid cheap
Ya but console game prices and having to pay to play online
You don't need a 4090 to play games or to make the game look nicer than on a console People losing their minds because these things get pricier is kind of funny because even 15 years ago I always thought the prices of the latest hardware were absolutely ridiculous and terrible value in terms of value depreciation only crypto mining artificially increase the demand so much that it made the value depreciation much lower
It s economics The GPU MSRPs will settle where people will buy Nvidia won t price themselves out of customers Either people continue to buy at high prices or low demand will drive prices lower Jensen can say whatever he s wants Let s hope people don t continue to support these crazy prices
not ENTIRELY true If R D costs have been rising with each successive generation it makes sense that prices would need to rise as well Not to mention TSMC is charging Nvidia 20 more these days That said Im 100 sure that's bullshit and Jensen in just trying to become Apple and price gouge people Praying for AMD to put out something competitive
It seems a lot of people have lost touch with reality especially these companies The RTX 4090 in Australia costs 3000 MSRP and the RTX 4080 16GB Model costs 2250 MSRP I don't know how else to say this but that is insanely ridiculous They will 100 sell out do not get me wrong but long gone are the days where ordinary working people and those living on a tight budget can afford a new decent PC gaming setup when technologies are first released A decade ago this was a reality two decades ago the same You could be living on a very tight budget in a country like Australia and save for a couple of months and be able to buy yourself a decent gaming PC back in the day up to the Turing era With the current inflation of the usual household items themselves petrol prices rent and the general cost of living those living on a budget are already completely out of the picture forget about it they've been out of the picture for a few years now And those who have decent jobs and a family are barely saving anything while also living pay check to pay check with the current cost of living It is gone Gaming on PC for so many people is a thing of the past It has been just a sub par experience for years now and it just keeps getting worse sadly This is something I wish tech channels would discuss too once the reviews hit So many people are just priced out of having an enjoyable gaming experience on PC in the modern day at least if they want to play the latest AAA titles We are only catering to the few who can afford these ridicilous prices or to the crypto focused businesses that have sucked the majority of stock over the last half a decade or so
You aren't alone I wasn't entirely pleased with the last launch either but the price to performance for the 3000 series cards was insane and a huge upgrade over my 1080 Now that they saw that people would pay an absurd amount of money for their products why wouldn't they blatantly ask for it at launch It's greedy and scummy I understand that R D goes into the chips but I highly doubt they need to charge this inflated amount Now this mixed with EVGA leaving the market and you have a 4080 that is clearly a rebranded 4070 I'm done It's shitty business all the way around I will ride my 3080 into the dirt at this point and when that happens it's currently going to be team red for me
Never again and I think they are saying you will buy our chips at the prices we tell you even though the cost does drop That's basic manufacturing the more you make the cheaper they are It's more than that Nvidia sells these GPU's at high margins These chips do not cost 500 each and the rest of the graphics card does not cost many hundreds of dollars each either They are charging these prices because it's what they think they can get away with not because it's what they NEED to sell them at in order to have a sustainable business When in the past prices drop later on it's not because things got so much cheaper for them it's because when sales start to slow they have to reduce prices to keep shifting them They always had the overhead to price them lower
Doubt He'll be selling to data centers even more then He'll more likely be fuck gamers
That last line as a parting last ditch attempt was just too funny
The sad part is I can actually imagine Jensen playing this scenario in his head with a random customer when he inevitably sees his company's revenue going down the shitter after all this
The thing is that Nvidia has enough non gaming business to survive now Much as I want this to happen though
Same here I have a AW3418DW and I love it but it's firmware locked to gsync only I also got a 3080FE so I'm going to hold on to this combo for as long as I can Then maybe swap both out around the time Elder Scrolls 6 or Witcher 4 comes out Hopefully they can last that long
If the monitor is G Sync compatible that's just Nvidia allowing freesync to function Original G Sync monitors with the module or what they now call 'G Sync Ultimate' would be the proprietary types
I'm just hoping switching gpu makers isn't that hard I've only ever owned Nvidia GPUs well two really
Welcome to reddit
Probably but what are you farming Negative karma rolling on the floor laughing
There's a great comment on TomsHardware Cue comment on Toms I'm going to wait for Nvidia to flesh out the rest of their lineup I hear they are going to have a midrange RTX 4080 8GB at 799 and the entry level RTX 4080 6GB at 699 But personally I need a low end rig to run OBS so I'm super excited for their lowest end RTX 40xx card the budget gamer RTX 4080 4GB It's going to be a total steal at 599 That's 100 cheaper than the launch price of the RTX 3080
holy shit lol
They did what amd did increased the cache and reduced the bus width its still the 70 series die of old
Great meme but to be fair the GTX 960 was a 128 bit card and the GTX 760 was a 256 bit card rebrand of the GTX 670 The chart has taken some liberties
I'm not trying to defend this scumbag of a company but why does it matter so long as the memory bandwidth isn't an issue Never mind memory bandwidth is heavily compromised 3080 10GB is at 760GB s 4080 12GB at just 503GB Granted a large cache refined memory subsystem could eliminate this penalty but I sort of doubt it Also 4080 16GB has a slower memory bus than 3080 10GB albeit with that large 320 bit bus That makes this price scalping even worse the product should be cheaper easier to manufacture with that bus nerf Fuck NVIDIA truly I won't buy a GPU at those prices even if I could justify burning that amount of money for more frames I'll go AMD when I can from now on so long as they don't fuck us over too
And it makes sense There is no market for an expensive new midrange card when Ampere will be on the shelf for months
Same spent the last year looking forward to this launch but can't justify purchasing any of the 3 options
I know one person means nothing to nvidia but I refuse to bend over Its just like voting one individual vote is worthless but millions of them make a difference The thing is I dont have enough faith in people to expect them to stop themselves from buying these gpus Most people have zero willpower when it comes to money and just impulse purchase everything they see Nvidia is going to be scamming hundreds of thousands of clueless people with that 4080 12 GB and there isnt a damn thing we can do about it Thats the frustrating part Nvidia greed I can handle its expected But people buying into it is what kills me
Even if 40xx were priced at the same 30xx you would ve considered upgrading
4090 is just a 100 increase over 3090 I wouldn't exactly consider that overpriced 4080 models sure are overpriced though
Same I can easily afford launch prices but will not be buying Probably going to skip this generation unless pricing returns to previous gen ranges Also the security of purchasing an EVGA product is gone Their service was untouchable I don't have the same confidence in any other AIB
Same boat as me there is no way I justify those prices to myself Think I ll stick with my 3090
And don' take it out of their bottom line
true and at the same time we don t really need the power of 4000 series to enjoy these days games most of the most played and enjoy games should be easy on hardware demand and crowded with players
I got a 3060Ti because it was the only thing I managed to get near MSRP reasonably close to launch I m not a big gamer but I do like to upgrade I think this will be fine for me for a while Next time it s gonna be AMD for sure
I'm sure you are one of many I'm in the same situation got a 3080 at launch was happy to upgrade my wifes and get a new one but the prices are silly
Same here My career lets me justify buying top tier cards but I can't in good conscience send the message to nVidia that this is acceptable I'm either holding onto my 3090 for a while or I'm switching to AMD I know one person means nothing to nvidia but I refuse to bend over There's at least a few of us
One person may not matter but here's a second person that won't matter I picked up a 3090 FTW3 Ultra Gaming 1700 at launch MSRP I have the luxury of disposable income to put money down on the fastest card in the lineup in the vein of performance However if you have your base price set at 1500 that Ultra version of the card will be 4 slots legit shady business practices over the 3000 series eVGA running away what should be a 4070 listed as a little 4080 noticeable room for a 4080Ti squeezed into the nVidia go fuck yourselves Looks like my new build this year will be going team blue red or red red on principal They've done things in the past you could look at from different angles and sort of understand what's up I have no sympathy for this greed and distain for their own customers Go the fuck on
I am in the same boat of hoping to get a 4090 or 4080 I have had a 3070 and two 3080s Gotten my friends multiple 3070s and 3060s I haven't much issues acquiring cards at msrp I hated the price stock complainers a ton All you had to do was sign up for raffles and not be too picky lol Either way I am not buying a 4000 series card at these prices Even if there is a big performance leap all of us enthusiasts already bit the bullet on paying the post tariff MSRP of the 3000s series cards
Hooold Don't bend the knee
Sitting on a 3060 Ti not exactly a super card but good enough to play games at 1080p 60 FPS for a while At the end of the day I'm not exactly sitting here dying for a 4090 That being said NVIDIA does make a good product but I can't justify spending 3k AUD on a graphics card
I mean with the margins they make one of these things they can afford to lose a few buyers as long as 1 person does buy it They are also still targetting people on 2000 series GPUs an older that are yet to upgrade They might buy some of the 3000 series stock they want to get rid They know the community response and third party reviews will be quite negative they know the sales will be lower All they need is enough people buying them who don't pay attention to that stuff and hopefully a lot of the people that do pay attention and don't already have a 3000 series card will just buy one of them For all the salty people that may have upgraded at lower prices that didn't they will get us next generation Most of us won't actually follow through on never buying Nvidia again and will just skip a generation For the 5000 series the culmative performance jump will be attractive and since a lot of us are enthusiasts the latest games will be pushing our current GPUs to the limit at high resolutions They might even have slightly lower prices so they can pull another Pascal friends it's safe to upgrade moment Although I don't think a 700 x02 die flagship is in the cards again in the near future
So 100 dollars increase over a 3090 is enough to stop you from getting a 4090 It wouldn't make much sense to even upgrade from the 30 series to 40 series unless you were getting a 4090 anyway
How much you were expecting the 4090 to be Since the 3090 was 1499
What did you expect the prices to be The 3090 launched at 1500 the 4090 is 1600
The 3090ti launch price was higher than the 4090 launch price
Only the 4090 is decently prices The 690 was 999 at launch in 2012 which equlas 1300usd now The 3090 was 1499usd which is 1750usd today
I paid 200 USD and some change less then the 4090 for my evga 2080 ti sc ultra seems like its been this way for flagship cards since 2018
The 4090 is the only card that makes a small amount of sense being only 100 more than the 3090 at launch That's actually more than 100 less than inflation in the short 2 years since 3090's launch
It's funny but the 4090 is the best priced of all 3 new cards The 3090 3090 ti is about 1000 right now and the 4090 is roughly 1 5 1 6x the performance in standard games without DLSS ray tracing on according to Nvidia graphs So if you need the 24gb of vram the price performance is about the same the ray tracing tensor core upgrades are nice and the card is only 99 more than last year so no giant unexpected price hikes If you look at the 4080 12gb which is a little under the 3090ti you can get similar performance with a 699 or less RX 6900XT 16GB or a 740 or less 3080ti 3080 12GB So overall if you were set on a 1500 4090 on day 1 for any reason you are perfectly happy with the 1600 price tag If you wanted a reasonablely priced 4080 using a cut down die from the 4090 like last year you got screwed since the 4080 16GB is cut down to 59 the die size as the 4090 and the 4080 12GB is 49 with even less memory bandwidth at prices 300 where they both should be With raised prices it still should be 1599 4090 98 99 full die 1199 4080 ti 16GB 90 95 die size 899 4080 16GB 75 80 die size 599 4070 12GB 60 die size 499 4060 ti 12GB 45 die size 379 4060 8GB 35 die size 279 4050 8GB 25 die size But instead we get this bullshit 1599 4090 98 99 full die 1199 4080 16GB 59 die size 899 4080 12GB 49 die size
If this happens it's going to leave a damn bitter taste in all the people who stumped up for a 40 series card prior
Nah idiots will upgrade
Or option 3 I buy used at a discount from the mining surplus and help Nvidia zero percent
will buy a discount RTX 30 card instead But they're not discounting the 30 series cards outside the super high end overpriced ones They're literally still trying to sell the 30 series lineup for the same price that they originally cost That's the whole problem and why the quote from Jensen is absolutely maddening They dont want to discount GPU's anymore
Or move over and buy AMD instead A 6800xt is 525 near me at Microcenter
Yeah I m in the same boat and this is the last straw for me The 2070s will most likely be my last Nvidia GPU if AMD doesn t mess up big time
Because now that mining crashed they probably have a huge stock of 30 series cards that still need to be sold Btw how is that 4090 looking Any benchmarks
Shit I work at a hardware store and could tell you that High level corporate coming in and asking What's our problem hitting sales numbers The problem is you're expecting 5 YOY Growth from 2 years where we just exploded 30 It's like they won the lottery and are wondering why you haven't won it again yet
I'm not sure what the solution for that would be Well the 'free market' solution is that we stop buying products services from companies when they start to dick us over Of course in reality this becomes difficult when as you say these companies start buying up others and creating an effective monopoly or at least a 'limited competition' situation which is why we also need strong anti trust activists in government something we are also ultimately responsible for There's definitely ways to fight it but unfortunately companies know full well how much the average person isn't actually that
No changes TSMC told them that deal stands as is they cannot cut down their allocation
They can't cut down on chip numbers TSMC only allowed them to delay their release throughout the end of 2022 and early 2023 While originally I think NV planned to release the entire lineup in October November
if last i checked i need a 3090 or RTX 4000 or RX7000 equivalent to play cyberpunk on May settings on 't need to replace my 2070 anytime soon
IMO were either on the cusp of Nvidia taking a hit or a time where GPUs just isn't primarily a gaming device anymore and them getting way bigger We're already there in some ways but I dont think insert scifi setting here has Nvidia cards in the gaming rigs
Not just up up by A LOT NVIDIA'S stock dropped last earnings not because they lost money but they didn't hit hyper aggressive targets They still made billions still made a profit but not enough billions It's a very fucked up system
While its true that their AI business is doing good for now gaming used to be their biggest earner until the crypto bust Their gross margins fell 21 pts y y and net profit dropped 72 y y that is not a sign of a healthy company long term Its clear that nvidia is now a data center automotive ai company these days with gaming secondary But with Intel entering the discrete AI market with both gpu and cpu more aggressively along with AMD and other big companies like MS Google FB Tesla etc making their own AI chips the future for NVIDIA looks bleak 10 years out That s why Jensen desperately wanted to take over ARM it was likely NVIDIAs last hail mary In a decade NVIDIA will either go bankrupt or merge with another company Their 65 margins are an unsustainable goal long term they aren t Apple and never will be
Can that argument really be made when Moore s law is still going strong It s clear these limitations are not an issue and will not be for some time
How can you blame people for expectations if we have massively hyped tech launches basically every year They could easily just launch new consumer shit less often every 4 years or more like consoles and no one would be affected except for corp wallets
He's not just talking about making new people but population growth which can't go on forever obviously
with Zuckerberg peeking at you in the shower
In Spain were I do live the most common salary after taxes is 1250 you are right a full month salary for a mid range GPU RTX 4080 12GB aka RTX 4070
For my argentinian friend it's a year and a half worth Shit is unacceptable
Counterpoint once the 30 series are gone people still are not going to be interested in buying 40 series because they already have a capable GPU so Nvidia are still left holding the bag on thousands of 40 series units that they're going to have to let go at much smaller margins by the time the 50 series comes out They're still losing when people buy 30 series
wasn't the 6900 XT launched at 500 cheaper MSRP than the RTX 3090
They did that with Zen2 and they really need more market share for their GPUs so its the perfect time to strike
AMD at least waits until they have a relatively high market share before they start turning heel They have incentives to undercut Nvidia right now just like they had incentives to undercut Intel
kinda N4 wafers are probably some 2 4x as expensive as samsung's 8nm wafers a single AD102 die could easily cost double or even more than a GA102 die to nvidia it's not entirely implausible their margins on 4090s are less than on a 3090 despite the cheaper 2GB G6X chips As for the rest wait for the super refresh at normal prices P
Isn't it 6 years old from techppwerup The GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB was a performance segment graphics card by NVIDIA launched on July 19th 2016
GTX 1060 6 GB was launched in 2016 for 300 Adjusted for inflation that is 350 in August 2022 currency Current lowest price for a 3060 on newegg is 370 310 for open box
Unfortunately they'll have to do more than just slightly undercut these RTX 4000 prices Just slightly means people continue to say stuff like NVENC DLSS is worth the premium They need to stay within the realm of the current generation pricing And that means 35 40 cuts off from what Nvidia just shat out The 4070 4080 12GB is 80 more expensive than a 3070 The 4080 16GB is 71 more expensive than the 3080 These price increases are astronomical
It's gonna take more than a slight undercut to make me ever consider buying their GPUs
100 they reap the benefits in multiple ways of playing second fiddle to Nvidia in the gfx market and to a great many people that all hail our holy lady Dr Lisa Su who'd have thought the market would do your marketing for you eh
Why do people have to buy the best Right now the 3000 series is the best value you could buy A 3080 3090 runs 4K tremendously well for still being a 2 year old card
You know you don't need a bleeding edge gpu to play games right resulted in almost a decade of barely anyone gaming on PC This doom and gloom around PC gaming continues to be hilarious
Why would it affect pc gaming least of all kill it lmao Everyone here seems to be okay running 1080 Ti still
50 100 won't be enough if there is still a massive gulf in features and non gaming aspects Like RDNA2 regardless of what it is priced at the only use case it is an option in would be straight DX11 DX12 Vulkan gaming preferably below 4K with no RT It loses out in most other areas If someone is dropping big money on a card at that point they're just going to drop a bit extra and get the card that can do more things
We're all LT today
You just figured out their revenue model for next decade Their server chips are already paving way for this
I'm not defending the high prices obviously since I was hoping to buy one but you also have to look at the volume discounts which NVIDIA lost and the increase in cost of manufacturing due to the much large size of the coolers and complexity of the PCB power delivery
Yeah I think people are underestimating the macroeconomic conditions right now Sure these gpus are overpriced but shouldn't be too hopeful to get the same kind of price performance improvements in perpetuity as previous years It's a pipe dream of infinite scale and infinite growth
TSMC 5 nm or 4N in this case cost a lot more than 7nm wafers For a few nodes now the price per transistor has actually stayed roughly the same see for a source you can find this elsewhere if you look This used to drop dramatically with each node This isn't 100 accurate as holding the transistor count steady you should see a die shrink from process to process and the same design will get better yields on a smaller process Generally though yields are quite high except for very large dies so this doesn't help much normally For GPUs each new generation has largely relied on process shrinks reducing the cost per transistor to raise performance Sadly this era is behind us and more complicated chips are going to cost more to manufacturer and this will have to flow through to the final retail price
No he's not manufacturing a 5nm wafer is vastly more expensive than the older nodes This isn't a lie This is a fact Do you know how much a single EUV machine costs 250 million dollars For one machine TSMC didn't just raise prices due to higher demand The cost of the fabs and the R D costs are insane We're talking tens of billions of USD in R D alone
I am rocking a 3080 on 1440p 144Hz screen and yeah AAA titles easily push it to its limit The only game that would make me upgrade would be Stalker 2 and that's even questionable if it ever comes out Nvidia can suck it with their proper 4080 starting 1k they are fucking delusional lmao Covid is mostly over mining is mostly over the majority won't shell out these prices
I mean you realize you're also buying a card that's potentially significantly more powerful than the last generation And you can just buy a lower teir card that is comparable in both price and performance to last generations upper level cards
You mean like ssds and psus that sky rocketed years ago
Among launch window cards so no Supers or Ti's except the misnamed 20 series Titan GM200 3072 no higher core count this generation 980 GM200 2048 67 970 GM204 1664 54 Titan GP102 3584 though the later Titan Xp was 3840 1080 GP104 2560 71 1070 GP104 1920 54 2080Ti TU102 4352 though the later Titan RTX was 4608 2080 TU104 2944 68 2070 TU106 2304 53 3090 GA102 10496 though the later 3090Ti was 10752 3080 GA102 8704 83 3070 GA104 5888 56 4090 AD102 16384 though the coming Beast is 18432 4080 AD103 9728 59 4070 AD104 7680 47
game developers have gotten good at faking raytracing so I just don't even bother having realtime ray tracing on
How do you know how the card was used though
Fwiw Linus did a video proving that gpus used for mining do not decrease in performance by any means
fyi depending on HOW a card was mined on it may be in better health than a card that was gamed on mining software underclocks and undervolts the core while ramping the fans to 100 This does wear the fans out but good fans are good for something like 15 years 24 7 while bad fans are easy to swap out refresh Gaming on a card runs the core at 100 full heat VRM and hotspot temps maxed and has lots of rapid thermal cycling as the user starts and stops varying titles of game And generally speaking thermal cycles are what kill cards as the solder eventually cracks from the repeated stress of thermal expansion shrink
It's funny that I'm considering upgrading my 2060 to a
It just so happens I'm looking to sell one if you're interested Gaming only usage
Mine nomined what s the difference If it s cheaper the only thing to worry about may be the fans
Probably gonna buy a used 3080 non mined You're probably better served if it was a mining card Constant load through mining is way better than erratic load through gaming
I have a 3080 and I rib many different resolutions but I also own a 3440x1440p 120hz panel and the 3080 with 9700k 32gb ram 3200mhz and I can't hit 120hz all the time or in all games Ultrawide is more demanding than 4k In the same games I get 130 to 140fos at 4k 16x9 If you want 1440p ultrawide go 3090 which I'm about to change too because Vram is more important for me due to VR and triple 4k sim rig
Apparently there's always someone out there with a crap load of cash no matter the state of the economy Yeah it's precisely because of the economy that a few people actually do always have crap loads of
There s always people with cash but it s always those on credit that suffer the most during a crash We ve been running on a credit economy since the late 70 s
Yes that's what the very wealthy I've known do Mainly sit on cash until recessions and bear markets happen then swoop in
It's not someone it's foreign corporate investors and hedge funds
Helps that they crashed the market in 08 and scooped them all up Banks own entire neighborhoods america is turning into a mining town
Interest rates are rising The housing market is unsustainable as is Prices will drop Maybe not to where they were unless the economy collapses but they will drop
That's mostly moron property investors and flippers buying from other flippers and getting fucked Thankfully the market is suffering and a lot of flippers are being stuck holding the bag cause they are greedy cunts
Are you comparing houses to a piece of tech Houses appreciate technology depreciates It's a completely apples to oranges comparison
A house has way more value than a gpu I don t even see the FE cards selling out in seconds maybe like a day if at all
Thats what happens when your feds let your country get used as a vehicle for money laundering
Example are overseas Chinese
Some Rich person corporation buying a house to rent Which people need to live and make money off of is different from Nvidia selling overpriced luxury products
As long as you can turn a profit on graphics cards either with crypto or reselling the prices will not fall one cent
Corporations are buying up housing That's why the market is super inflated They aren't going to be buying these cards You're comparing apples to oranges
People need a place to live a gaming PC not so much thankfully for gamers
One is a fully permanent investment that will rise in value and provide essential things that will always have value Also naturally VERY limited in number The other is something you have for fun is pure luxury and even at that often only mildly better then the alternatives And ye there is always someone But who cares if 500 people are willing to pay even 5k for a new nvidia card if the other 50 million buy old amd cards
Yeah investors buying everything in US to keep the prices high it doesn't matter if it has to be empty for a while they can wait for score big
Housing vs graphics cards One is a luxury item that depreciates in value yearly one is isn t
True and that certainly applies to their business side as those are investments But for consumers they are not and the growth cycle does not work the same way We'll have to see how the commercial market does
Prices only go up Once a company is able to sell stuff for a higher price there is damn near no way it goes down by anything significant
Or rather people who really shouldn't be spending that money but do There's more than just rich and living paycheck to paycheck Many people can save up a thousand dollars or two but rather than being smart with it it turns in to a credit card purchase and fuck it forget it and enjoy the new toy
someone out there with a crap load of cash They re called corporations and they re contributing enormously to the current real estate bubble It should be illegal but too many rich and powerful people are making too much money off of it
Difference is a house will still be a house in 30 years and can earn you an income Cards can no longer do that and will be in a landfill in 10 years
Everyone need a place to live Rich billionaires take the opportunity to buy buy buy everyone out of the market Not everyone need a gpu Unless gpu renting become a thing It's not a thing yet Now it's a good time for amd and Intel to make a good play Then again not the first time amd and Intel miss their chances
Well all of china wants western real estate hedge funds got in millennials started buying homes and boomers moved I honestly think we might never have a home boom in the US like the one we just had China is having issues Boomers will start dying Loans are pricey Perfect storm for mass home liquidation
I agreed with you totally
People with a crap load of cash might be happy to drop it on an appreciating asset like a house but there are not many people wanting to drop it on luxury goods that depreciate as rapidly as GPUs do these days
There is and unlike for 1 5M houses the vast majority of working adults can save up 1600 every 2 4 years for something if it's a priority to them I thought consumers would balk at the first 1000 iPhone when it came out and no one flinched
Zillow is a big problem in the housing market they're buying up houses for over value at times with cash to use those as rentals Somewhere along the line I had heard that one of the Scandinavian countries does not allow Zillow to buy houses for this reason
Weren't a lot of those people crypto miners expecting a return on investment
During the stimuli check phase and when people had plenty of times to play video game Plus crypto was at ATH tho Not sure that people will buy an overprice gpu in a recession
Right but those prices were paid because there were not enough cards Nvidia needs volume to make money and I don't think they're going to move the volume they're going to need to make the money they want at these price points Maybe I'm wrong but I know I'm out and I have plenty of money to buy one if I wanted
Difference was people had more money and stimulus checks depending on the country you were in many people are now being pinched by cost of living increases thanks to high inflation and credit card interest I don t think it s going to be the exact same as before
Yes but you are largely ignoring why people were paying so much for those cards It was because there were no better deals on the used market today there is
I bought 17 30 series GPUs in 2021 mining purposes only Prior to that I bought just one in the past 5 years I think there were many many folks like me buying that ROI passive income Now that mining is dead I am selling 16 and keeping 1 Again suspect others will do the same The result Less demand from one time volume buyers to mine and now a flood of still very good very powerful 30 series at a fraction of the cost Those 4090 s will not blow off the shelves given less buyers and a flood of capable cheap GPUs
PS5s were selling for 1200 and were bought in seconds
I hate to buck the narrative around here but I will be one of those people clamoring to buy a day one 4090 I need the horsepower for video editing encoding and ML
I'd imagine volume will be less especially as the 30 series cards are continually dropping If the 3080 hits like 500 or so I'm in
Recession denial Anybody that s paying attention knows what s going on and how much worse it s going to get Even those that know still publicly deny recession because it s a self fulfilling prophecy Buckle up That 4090 s not going to feed the family at least it ll keep the house warm
The problem lies mostly with the small 4080 aka 4070 that is seeing a big price increase vs previous generations
You outed yourself as a fool the moment you called him Brandon
Ok Miss Grab em by the Pussy
The U S government sent 3200 to people during Covid I bet a good amount of that went to buying personal electronics
Their strategy seems to be kicking the can further down the road by shifting the market away from gamers and into developers data centers others and they lost a massive market with being banned from selling into china in 2023
It s not that Gamers will buy these cards mostly The issue is you are competing for time on TSMC s 4nm node which means you re competing with professional users datacenters you re competing with iPhones next gen macbooks latest and greatest smartphone laptop all of which are significantly more profitable per mm 2 of the wafer Think of it this way Apple s A16 bionic latest chip in iPhone 14 Pros were also made on TSMC 4nm node Those iPhones sell for 999 and 1099 But the A16 Bionic probably has a die area of 88mm 2 based on A14 Bionic size The chip in 4090 has a die area of 608mm 2 And 4090 sells for 1600 Now that s already 7x more die but consider we re working with 12 inch diameter circle wafers Try to tile squares inside a circle the smaller the square the less wasted space you have at the edges That s what you re competing against when you buy a desktop graphics card Wafer cost is proprietary but it s north of 20k for sure
Because the shareholders don't care They are looking for return on their investment If Nvidia's profit takes a hit so too does their stock Shareholders want the best possible return on their shares now performance a year from now doesn't matter Jensen and other C suite execs likely also have a bonus that is contingent on performance of the stock If the company is less profitable down goes the share price and so too does their compensation package
For CPUs yes For raster no but realistically yes just as you said increasing from 1 million triangles to 10 million triangles for a model makes effectively no difference Whereas in the n64 days if you doubled the triangles you were essentially moving ahead a whole generation of console
No not for a while We haven't even started gaafet Gaafet should give a lot of of life
Gross profit margin is 60 I'm obviously not talking about Net Margin which was 30 last quarter btw Not sure what version of margin was 10
I do enjoy how Nvidia's apocalypse quarter net margins were higher than many large companies can even dream of
Honestly I would consider the 3080 12gig to be capable of super high end gaming
I totally agree I was caught between 3080 3080ti and went ti for some 4k 60 gaming but I think most people are better suited to 3080s and getting a gorgeous 1440p 144
And get the 12gb model for anyone looking at 3080 More future proof via vram and more cores despite similar SKU
This It really is just a solid over all card Definitely worth a look given the prices of the 4000 series
Buying a 3090 or 3090 ti to wait for the rtx 7000 series
Probably what I'm gonna go with when I'm ready to get a gaming PC My current PC is 8 years old and was roughly mid spec when I bought it and I haven't upgraded it Gonna keep it for non gaming stuff
What card is actually good for 4K assuming native 60fps gaming Most of the entire RTX 3000 lineup can barely hold or get past 60fps in 4K in AAA games And true next gen games haven't even come out yet If i wanna make sure that i can run GTA 6 in 4K 60 in 3 4 years what card should one buy right now Or is the tech still not there
They won't sell GPUs for less money but in 4 years from now you will have a gpu with 4x the performance of 4090 let's say 6080 or 6070 which will cost around 1000 or less The issue with the 4000 series isn't just the prices Nvidia announced it's that in many countries like mine when Nvidia says that the MSRP is 1600 for a 4090 the custom AIB costs 2500 I bought a used car for 500 less than that lol
It really depends on what the market looks like in 4 years and the costs to them If production costs are low enough that they can have low prices to block market share from going to AMD or any other competitor at that point they may come down But given how Nvidia has such a stranglehold on the GPU market and hold an edge with with ray tracing and DLSS they can probably set prices however the hell they want since they can claim it's as much hardware as software capabilities But more likely than not prices aren't going down anytime soon
That would be an 8gb rtx 't be surprised if that happened too just to see what they could get away
Mine got faulty on 2019 I tried to reflow but it never worked Awesome card rest in peace
Yeah say what you will about the high end but the really shit thing is that the low end price for entry has gone up so much And basically for several gens now the performance at the entry level has stagnated for same cost of entry each gen since like Pascal Meaning for the money spent today on entry level its the exact same performance as the same amount of money spent last gen entry level Totally stagnant In some cases its even more expensive now
That price was never feasible hence it rising almost immediately You also missed the point in your outrage I never said it was reasonable simply provided some reasons Nothing more nothing less Nobody NEEDS a 4090 especially at the moment
r patientgamers
don't forget Amd is releasing new cards Maybe wait and see also 1 or 2 years from now Nvidia might be humbled and actually give decent prices
Serious question do you think that if GPU affordability is shrinking the high end gaming market that game devs will look at what consumers actually own and say fuck it let s not push the specs for our games anymore It takes a huge investment to make triple A games and I m sure visuals are a big part of that cost But if the customer base for games is getting priced out of the hardware then why stay in the race This is probably just wishful thinking but as someone who s played PC games since the 1980s graphics are so good now that future improvements feel like they re going to be increasingly marginal Maybe people will start to think that the current gen is good enough until the market becomes more sane again
Why wouldn't you just wait and see what Nvidias 600 700 dollar offerings end up being It's obviously going to be much faster than a 1080 ti
I would look at consoles but I do Alot more on my PC than just game Thats the problem with consoles it's for games only PC's are multimedia platforms they do just about anything you put your mind too
I think Radeon 7000 will be it this time round Or getting a 3080 12gb from evga
I was looking forward to upgrading from a 1080 my PC is otherwise comparable Waiting on AMD now before I likely just carry on until the 1080 gives up
Realistically the current comparable to the 1080Ti GP102 is the 4090 AD102
7700K 447 in 2022 dollars ITX mobo 230 in 2022 dollars 16GB DD4 memory 302 in 2022 dollars 500GB nvme drive 362 in 2022 dollars 1080 Ti 845 in 2022 dollars Your PC components total 2186 adjusted for inflation while your current comparable system totals 2050 and is almost an order of magnitude more powerful Also you don't even need to buy anything more than a 12600K which is under 300 and would put your comparable system under the 2000 mark The jump in performance from a 1080 Ti to a 4080 is immense nevermind the new technology that's available between these generations You're looking at a demonstrably radically better PC for less cost I'm not seeing the scam here for your particular situation to be honest Which is not to say the prices are okay in all instances for example there's no clear and convincing evidence yet suggesting I should upgrade from the system I built just this past year or that everyone has 2000 to spend right now There is also a serious problem at the entry level which has priced a lot of people out of PC gaming entirely Some perspective is useful though because on the high end this has always been an expensive hobby It was true in 2017 it was true in 2000 and it's true today
12000k sounds like 1 core cpu
People who defend this shit over inflation are blind fanboys and idiots
It's pointless to look just at retail prices without looking at the costs to produce such things TSMC recently bumped up their prices by 20 Source So Nvidia's bill of materials is probably like 10 15 more just off that increase alone General inflation in 2016 2022 1080Ti release year is another 10 on top So the 4080 that you mentioned is like 950 1000 per card in 2016 money if you remove the inflation and objective component cost increases At the same time in pure rasterisation 4080 16gb seems 20 faster than 3090Ti based off Nvidia slides taking only the games that don't have the frame insertion feature and 3090Ti is like 60 faster than 1080Ti on average across resolutions 72 faster in 4K So in the end if you take 1080Ti as 100 perf 3090Ti will be 160 perf and 4080 will be 192 perf this is without DLSS With DLSS you're looking at 250 300 extra performance depending on DLSS type In the end you're paying extra 40 50 premium for about 2 3x in performance which means that you get extra 150 performance taken average for extra 50 in price in 2016 money 980Ti to 1080Ti was 10 in cost vs 30 35 boost in performance which seems a lot more attractive because it doesn't really change the price but results in almost the same ratio Now I am not saying that PC gaming isn't becoming more and more expensive or that raising prices isn't bad but instead urging to look past the obvious price increase and compare that to the objective reality as opposed to just say Nvidia bad cause prices got raised The quick numbers I pulled up the GPU perf comparisons taken off show that the increase in performance across those generations is substantial enough to be comparable to the price increase It is slightly worse and it does result in the climbing prices for high end GPUs but at the same time 3060 Ti is extremely similar to 1080Ti in performance in 1440p and 4K is even faster by 10 30 depending on the game but the MSRP is 40 less So you can't say that all GPUs did do is become more expensive without providing anything in exchange High end GPUs do get worse and worse in terms of value for money but there are plenty of other options that give you an upgrade in price perf ratio
A high price is not a scam It's just a price you aren't willing to pay It's okay that there exist GPUs that are outside of your budget They aren't holding a gun to your head forcing you to buy this and you don't need to always have the latest and greatest gpu to play videogames My nearly 6 year old 1080ti runs new games just fine
Wait what I swear my 7700K was like 270 I also don t remember NVMe s being THAT bad Also kind of unfair to do 1080ti instead of 1080 since the 1080 dropped from 700 to 500 something when the 1080ti released a year later
I saw a z690 motherboard by ASUS that has an MSRP of 1999 I couldn t believe it I haven t priced motherboards in a while but I hope that one was a fluke
Steam deck baby red heartred heartred heart
I was thinking about this the other day I remember buying two GTX580's in 2011 for a price that I suspect won't even get me half a 4080 Like yeah it was a decade ago and inflation is a thing but fk me 's
I got my 3080 FE Model for 650 around a year ago The 4080 16GB is apparently priced at 1269 in the UK I legit think I'll have to move to just console gaming in the future I can't justify that huge price increase for some extra utility More so that a fair few games on the latest gen consoles now run at 60fps or 120fps Will see what team red does I think
Yarp it's utterly insane My Xbox Series X cost me 500 No it doesn't match a top of the line PC in terms of graphics but it's good enough for the moment I'll get way more life out of it than I will a 1200 graphics card that'll be rubbish within 3 years
Heck and that's assuming Nvidia doesn't launch the 4080 Ti at a higher price point over the 4080 like they did with the 3080 and 3080 Ti You could be seeing an even larger price increase between the 1080 Ti and 4080 Ti
Current comparable is actually the 3060 performance wise Current Avg Price 500 I too am looking forward to seeing what Team Red will produce
I likely built my whole PC for what nVidia is going to charge for Yeah a lot of folks said the same exact thing years ago when the GTX 10 series debuted I remember thinking PC hobbyists were insane to pay those prices back and here we are now Errybody is losing their minds over this but I don't get it what did you all really expect They're just following the market trends Look at what people were still are paying for not only GPUs but all PC consumer tech They're not gonna leave money on the table and miss out on profits while partners scalpers and aftermarket resellers clean up If y'all don't like it don't buy it From what they see consumers stay buying what they produce at hiked up prices
I pretty much have the exact same setup as you 7700K 1080ti and after looking at what it would cost to build another high end gaming PC I could just do what I do in my favorite videogames R6 Siege CS GO COD in real life Now I do practical shooting multigun competitions and I gotta say I am having the time of my life I don t think I m coming back to PC gaming anytime soon
I am looking into PC gaming and this was very helpful thank you for taking the time to share this
You must've bought the 1080Ti when the cryptocraze hit Got mine for 700USD just before the cryptocraze
So here's what I tell people as long as your system does what you NEED it to do then your system is fine If you're still using a 1080P60 monitor and your system can output 60 FPS its just fine
I bought a Series X eat a dick Jensen
Completely off topic but just as an fyi If you buy a new NVME drive I highly recommend getting at least a 1TB drive NVME drives use a portion of the free space as a buffer to increase read write speeds As more of the drive is marked as in use that buffer gets smaller If that buffer gets completely filled then you get a massive decease in speed So having a larger drive means you can have more things saved installed before that limit starts becoming a problem for you It won't be unusable but you may as well get the performance you paid for you know
Lmfao at all the prices NVDA have lost their minds
You don t even need to go to a console I have a 3080 and honestly I haven t played many games that really needed it I got myself a steam Deck and I ve been gaming much more on that than my desktop I even plan to sell the gaming pc There really aren t many games that demand a top of the line gpu especially if you are willing to settle with 1080p or 1440p 60hz
Consoles are much more limited the frame caps on games like gta 5 and red dead are annoying But as a series x owner I can tell you the value is amazing You could buy a series x for 500 and a Mac mini for 700 a combo that is enough for many s needs gaming and computer wise and only then would you be spending as much as the 4080 by itself without a single other component High end pc gaming is going just become ridiculously expensive compared to the alternatives
Win 11 compatible
the numbers are even more absurd your 7th generation i7 is 30 less powerful than a 10th generation i5 which can be had from bestbuy for 120 so you could spend 1 3 the price for 130 of the processing power meanwhile GPU's are almost 2x i know they're more powerful but id 4259 id 3749 skuId 6411498 ref NS loc 101 extStoreId 44
what the biggest scam is just how much electricity they need
You're better off sticking with the 1080ti than looking at consoles lol I'm waiting to see what AMD has to offer or hoping Nvidia lowers prices of the 4000 series once they sell their 3000 stock
NVIDIA's MSRP almost tripled for the 3 cards branch they showed comparing the 1080 ti 1080 and 1070 to the current release in less than 6 years Inflation my arse
I wonder what the performance difference is between the two processors and then the two gpus
I mean at this point if people are 1 Perfectly fine with gaming at 60fps with adaptive resolution 2 Willing to play games regardless of input methods 3 Willing to miss out on PC exclusives Then just get a console and be done with it We don t even know if Ada s gonna be the price ceiling for gpus But i bet it won t be and those memes about buying a midrange pc that can compete with consoles for 500 That ll be gone within the next few years
Fools are still paying it That s the problem If people didn t buy them prices would drop big time
Hell I feel like AMD could back off of future focused hardware R D at this point and still capture a major portion of the market Honestly APUs like the one in the Steam Deck and the 6800U aren t too far from being good enough for gaming for most people If AMD can release an affordable APU with enough performance for 1080p 60 high Nvida would be in real trouble
Furthering your point indie games for the most part don t need 1600 graphics cards to run In fact a lot of them run perfectly well on integrated chipsets NVIDIA s push for the top only benefits new AAA titles and even then the games still look fantastic on medium settings as they would on console
It's like someone on the executive team saw a release plan for 4090 1499 4080 899 4070 699 Then crossed out the 70 and wrote in 80 and moved everything up 300 and just shouted REVENUE
It is honestly really suspicious that the 4090 isn't more in price Either two things are happening Nvidia wants the price close to the 4080 16GB to get more people to buy the 4090 OR the 3090 was overpriced to begin with in 2020 The fact that a bunch of us bought the 3080 for the MSRP of 700 seems like a steal now No one should ever be spending 1k for a GPU It is time that most people switch over to AMD Hopefully the have a competition to DLSS and Ray tracing when they announce their new line in November
Nah the flaship top tier were the Titan cards A GTX x90 card was reserved for dual chip GPUs which were a total flop Like the GTX 590 And nobody was buying a Titan for gaming Even though it only cost 999 lol The 3000 series is the first one with a xx90 GPU just so they could milk customers more But that was fine because a 3080 was just 700 If you could get one I got my 3080 TUF at launch for 762 that includes 20 VAT Nvidia got used to scalper and mining prices and now they think just because they say so they can keep the inflated prices Fuck them
They're gonna be pushing folks to console gaming for sure like the 4080 16gb at msrp is at 1199 here in my country the starting price is at 1440 I could buy 3 ps5s for that price Agreed but what happens when the next PS5 Xbox Nintendo console comes out They will probably all rush back to AMD honestly because I'm sure at this point Nvidia will think they are too good to mass produce a low version chip just for them
You are delusional if you think anyone building a goddamn computer will be pushed to consoles just because the new shiny Nvidia cards are overpriced 3K cards are flying off the shelves for great prices right now and are more than enough for the vast majority of gamers Stop buying the newest shiny thing to fill the void inside and you'll find reason
Why do you think you'd need a 4080 16GB if you are ok with PS5 The 4080 is like 10x more powerful than the PS5 lol That tier of card is obviously for someone who wants to play games at max settings 4k 120 fps The vast majority of people have no use for that kind of power they would be much more suited with a 3070 or eventual 4060
Consoles aren't a 1 1 replacement They have almost always been the best bang for buck on release but you miss out on a lot by being constrained to them
The modern equivalent is playing every game in 4K with settings maxed at at least 120fps
5nm process for a 600mm 2 chip in 2020 was 238 from TSMC according to analysts so a 102 chip The 4nm is a customized 5nm process iirc not a new node Its marketing speak Our node is 1nm better than AMD Nvidia is translating a 40 chip cost increase on their 4090 into a 300 500 price increase in their other cards where the chip is probably actually cheaper The 4080 16GB has a 380mm die size So its significantly cheaper compared to the 3080 with its 638mm die any claimed cost increase due to the die costs for the 4080 16GB over the 3080 is a fat load of shit as it would have to increase in cost per square mm by 65 to match the die cost of the 3080 If anything the cost of the 4080 should decrease this year since the die cost should be lower as the 103 chip is so much smaller Our costs went up a few dozen dollars We have to increase prices by several hundred to keep up So long as AMD doesnt shit the bed I will be buying a 7800XT this generation I wont touch nvidia after all their bullshit Not counting GDDR6 costs or board costs the 4080 should really have decreased in price to like 599 The fact that its 1199 is pure bullshit on Nvidias part
AMD already put out competitive cards I own a 3080 12gb and a 6900XT The 6900XT has more consistent min fps and sustained FPS in the games that I play using 40 watts less on average All maxed out settings on 1440p and all games are 180fps and up
That said Im 100 sure that's bullshit and Jensen in just trying to become Apple and price gouge people Praying for AMD to put out something competitive But wait Who's fault is that though It seems to me 50 of Nvidia's RnD is on software at this point and yes RnD has always been a high cost but it wouldn't be a problem if Nvidia tried harder to sell in bulk not price
Amd CEO is Huang nephew rolling on the floor laughing as far as I know One family control both corporations AMD would never push hard against interest in Nvidia AMD gpu just exists just to make illusion of choice but main AMD business is CPU and Intel is their true rival not Nvidia I think AMD and Nvidia may be in secret partnership with shared technologies Having both corporations in one pocket without true rivals makes you feel like you can dictate any rules for market
E 's less bullshit than you think In 2019 2020 estimated price per chip for TSMC's 7nm was like 233 and Jensen thought that was too pricey so he went with Samsung's N8 and passed the savings on He couldn't do that this time around and needed TSMC's 4N TSMC's 4N is a refined 5nm node and for the sake of discussion we'll go with the estimated price per chip for TSMC 238 in 2020 money but GENERAL inflation was 15 over the past 2 years so we can use that as an estimate for chip fab cost inflation which makes the price per chip like 273 in 2022 money TSMC jacked prices up another 20 over that 328 per chip Etherium mining is gone so that wiped out an estimated 20 of annual GPU demand so they need to raise ARPU to compensate for that Now add the R D costs for developing Lovelace AND THEN add effects of supply chain issues on top of that This is before factoring in the 30 series inventory that they still want to move The prices aren't that crazy
The thing is that it's not like they are working on developing 5xxx series now from ground up The true R D is few gens ahead That's why we've seen very stable increase of performance from gen to gen it's around 15 20 and it never will be higher as they need to account for that cost Jensen said that himself on the Turing keynote
They will 100 sell out do not get me wrong Well there's the problem Where's the market demand Who spends that kind of money on your everyday gaming computer
or ppl will just do what they do now 6900xt is in massive stock still and can be got for 899 aussie on some deals my mate at mwave says the 6800 6900 are outselling the nvidia cards like 3 1 right now for this very reason hundreds of dollars of cheaper for only a few percent FPS drop If ur playing at anything under 4k that's all u will need for years lot of ppl will just buy that or a 3080 now if AMD plays this card with the 7900xt for example and they say its better than a 4080 but less than a they will win a massive market share from the ppl refusing to buy a 1600 dollar GPU
Watch them do a contract subscription service Kinda like apples supposed iPhone subscription Just pay us X amount each month and you can rent our card subject to approved credit and a contract Then you can turn it in and get the next latest and greatest
Nobody needs the latest top end GPU to enjoy gaming on a PC Sure it sucks what Nvidia is doing but realistically there's still tons of lower priced cards out there that will work just fine for people with tight budgets I'm still running a 2070s and can play most games at 60fps on high settings at 1440p Also there's tons of second hand cards floating around now for way below MSRP
The RTX 4090 in Australia costs 3000 MSRP and the RTX 4080 16GB Model costs 2250 MSRP Just because you call your currency a dollar and stole the dollar sign symbol doesn't mean there's not an exchange rate to USD m8 yes salaries are reduced by this conversion and so you have less purchasing power in general but it's not NVIDIA's responsibility to sell you hardware at a 20 discount If companies did that for hardware you'd end up with india ordering containers of hardware at half price and shipping them back for a huge markup
It is gone Gaming on PC for so many people is a thing of the past But I am sure all the consoles will gladly use them and pass on the cost This is nothing but a HUGE SCAM No wonder they just got a huge deal to manufacture more
This is totally whiny I have a GeForce GTX 1080 2G and I play Doom 2016 on it Surely there are cards between the 150 I spent on mine 5 years ago and the 2000 top of the line card You realize you can game without 48GB vram right
yeah the 4090 and 4080 aren t for people on a budget They should go buy a 3060Ti
They've lost touch with reality yet are setting prices to meet demand Seems like they aren't the ones out of touch
It was never a reality where people on a tight budget could afford top of the line PC hardware That is exactly what the 4090 and 4080 are top of the line We can all agree they are absurdly expensive but don't make up bullshit People on budgets have ALWAYS went for the 60 and 70 tier of cards
I do not disagree with you but this is a different perspective buying into feature creep is not essential Raw FPS numbers Gaming at higher and higher resolutions High Hz gaming Variable Refresh Rate Real Time Ray Tracing DLSS FSR etc are marketing perspectives on why a new generation of GPUs is the new hotness vs old GPUs If a PC gamer decides that 1440P 144Hz gaming is good enough for the moment then the tier of GPU each progressive generation needed is dropping Buying a top tier GPU is likely only going to be needed if you want to game at 4K at a high framerate The GTX 1080 does 1440P at 144Hz for the most part might have needed a bit of tweaking and some games would not run at that level New generation cards are going to achieve this low of the totem pole of card tiers I think that a lot of PC gamers are going to hold onto their cards and or buy second hand more Nvidia are going to be somewhat stuck chasing further and further shrinking market of people willing to pay for their new cards They probably know that sooner or later they are going to pumping out GPUs over specced for market realistic monitors and games so their market for new GPUs is going to shrink I guess thats like so many other tech markets like mp3 digital audio players The market is generally entry level stuff or over the top insane stuff When my FiiO X3 iii finally dies I will be stuck where the only replacement option that I have is to buy a used FiiO X3 iii as the market has shifted further into crazy priced SKUs
You mean AUD or USD 3k AUD is 2k USD
While I generally agree with your points one complicating factor is that the AUD has declined by 12 versus the USD which is NVIDIA's reference currency since April That's certainly not helping your local pricing either
This is depressing I kind of came to that realization back in 2003 and married console gaming I'm starting to investigate and budget for a return to PC gaming but left with the question how long will my build last me What will I need to change How much will I need to invest
but the price to performance for the 3000 series cards was insane It was never 'insane' it only felt that way because Turing was so crap Dont get me wrong the 3060Ti and 3080 were quite decent offerings and the 3070 as well though to a lesser extent but nothing about them was 'insane' at all It was an entirely normal generation leap by normal standards Something like the GTX970 for 330 that is actually an insane deal I'd also argue the RX480 for 200 as another semi recent example
That is probably the best monitor rn I settled for a 4k G7 on prime day instead but my next monitor will for sure be Oled with adaptive sync instead
Its not too bad You have to wipe the nvidia drivers with a program call DDU It takes a few steps but its not bad at all There are full walk throughs if you need them I have a 3070 so i plan on hanging on for a few years Maybe nvidia changes their bullshit stance and money grabbing habits by then If not then AMD it is My cousin has an AMD 5700xt that i put in his pc a year or so ago and it runs pretty well It runs a tad hot but that can be fixed with fan profiles
Echo chamber of autism
Good thing it doesn't matter
It got the updoots I have been mentioning only the past three gens in 1060 2060 3060 since the launch Despite having hugely varying die sizes the 192 bit remained constant among them
They did what AMD did which is increase cache and reduce bus width for RDNA2
The thing is I dont have enough faith in people to expect them to stop themselves from buying these gpus I think you're spot on I saw some guy was complaining and cursing Nvidia with all kinds of words but ended with I'll just get a 4080 anyway I'm genuinely baffled like what's the point of bitching if you still gonna hand in the money the way Nvidia wants It just doesn't make that much sense to me
Hell yeah If the 4080 16gb version was 699 MSRP and is twice as fast as my 3080 10gb I would definitely pick one up
Not until there is a new graphics format only NVIDIA can
Its way over what you can get a 3090ti for right now though
The 4090 isn't terrible no Though it's worth noting that the 4090 is like 10 cut down from the full AD102 chip A fair chunk more than the 3090 was We should also remember that the 3090 was considered terrible value at 1500 when it released as well A lot of people have forgotten this Though this is exactly how Nvidia conditions people to accept worse value as 'good deals'
The 3090 was overpriced and the 4090 being just 100 more doesn't make it a good value The 3090 had immense value to miners that wanted the highest density mining output with each card making 500 to 600 a month so they sold like hot cakes I'm legitimately curious to see sales figures this time around when it's primarily gamers and some workstations
The 3090 was over priced
The MSRP for the rtx 3090 Fe in EU with 19 VAT was 1530 now it's 1970 't add up
My 3090 is fine for a 3440x1440 monitor I don't see myself replacing the GPU until I replace the monitor and that will probably be 5 years from now
Question is though what if they called it a 4085 and 4087 Ie could it be their among convention that draws price comparisons that s aren t fair
The 3 are probably priced that way so you say F it and buy the 4090
I skipped the 3000 series I ve been waiting all year for this launch and this reveal was the most disappointing thing Praying that AMD come through with a good card at a respectable price because I won t be buying one of these 4000 cards at these prices but I also don t wanna buy a 3000 as it s not worth the upgrade
I think plenty of people will drop out of the hobby or just move to consoles if they really need to continue gaming I know my next PC is gonna have an APU Look we have economic data from everywhere in The West showing that people are going deeper and deeper into debt to sustain themselves It's not a question of will people still buy the cards It's starting to become a question of Who tf is actually able to buy these even on credit These prices cannot be sustained They might eek by with this gen and maybe even one more but the 1000 dollar GPU party Nvidia is throwing is coming to and end sooner rather than later
And it just sat on shelves even when people were buying up every other GPU Almost every Best Buy in my area had a stock of 3090Tis that they couldn't find anyone to buy
Lol Nvidia don't give a shit You know full well they'll slap in some super and Ti variants along the way like they always do Zero customer loyalty or appreciation
I think targeting idiots during an economic downturn will have diminishing returns If I was an investor I would be furious Fortunately I bought puts in August that expire in November Maybe I'll check out AMD's offerings with my gains Seems like supreme divine justice
Idiots are the ones who can t afford an 800 card to begin with
Yes but they wouldn't go as far as jeopardizing their new lineup to sell the old one Like people are seriously saying Nvidia is making sure that people don't buy their new cards so that they sell the old ones That makes little sense Those prices are here to stay unless people don't buy and Nvidia gets a harsh lesson
It s like that meme with the guy poking the world with a stick Instead it s a corporation poking its dead employee with a stick and telling it to get back to work and get more money
I like to play cyberpunk on April settings at 1440p
Cyberpunk seems like it s very inefficient but also has a ton of lights and stuff so maybe it s like particle effects I dunno f NVDA either way right
That's just the thing if high end video cards are super expensive then they won't be widely adopted game devs won't really target them and high end cards won't have a killer app and it will keep demand low for high end cards If they ever want gaming to be a growing portion of their business they need to push out good price to performance cards or they'll just become a mostly irrelevant part of the ecosystem with game devs looking to get customers with non graphics features Current gen consoles are 2 years old now and their availability was so poor that there are hardly any current gen exclusive titles And some of those studios are essentially owned by PS MSFT who have really good reason to push for hardware sales
Moore's law has not been going strong for some time now Nodes are getting more expensive because the time R D and manufacturing investment required has become monumental Intel's revenue in 1995 when they were at the top of their game was 's 80bn and they're still struggling to keep up in the node wars and an Intel CPU from 5 years ago still works fine today
Yeah that argument can be made because it's what is happening Transistor cost has been going up with newer nodes Previously we were seeing transistor sharply decline with a node shrink
It is not mandatory do buy new stuff that comes out are you going to condemn a company for wanting to sell stuff Seriously
This is a pretty weird argument You're saying that you'd rather a new thing you can't afford not exist at all rather than exist and maybe be something that you can afford down the line You're approaching the existence of these video cards with a I'm going to take my ball and go home perspective
Bro you don't need to buy a new GPU every year
I'm sure it can't But pray tell How long has it been going on so far What makes us imagine that we are the special generation which will see it end in our lifetime Furthermore please explain how making replacement people under the condition of population non growth fails to drive the demand cycle Be specific
2200km directly east of you and the average salary is exactly half of that
I am Spaniard as well And yes that is definitely a monthly salary
That is pretty low for a first world country IMO
The median salary in Spain is 2700 before taxes so about 2000 after taxes
A rtx 4070 is not a midrange gpu
No it's aka 4060 look at the memory bus All previous generations have had 60s on a192 bit memory bus while the step up to a 70 moved you into a 256 bit memory bus The 4080 12gb has a 192 bit memory bus
Yeah the 6900 XT was 1 000 opposed to the 1500 for the 3090
At this point I don t think they really want more marketshare If they feel their cards are even close to Nvidia they ll just price them 50 lower and call it a day I hope that s not the case but yeah
Do you think AMD wants to compete with Nvidia They re tacitly colluding riding the price gouging wave together and extracting more profits year on year If AMD were to heavily undercut Nvidia it d cause a price war and ruin all their progress
Zen2 was still reasonably priced 900 dollars for a 4070 is not
If that's the case then why did the 3090 4090 have the lowest bump in price when the 4090 is the significantly more expensive gpu to manufacture Meanwhile the 3070 to the 4070 it's a 4070 is nearly twice the price If the costs had to bump that high most businessmen would have just scaled down the 40 series to be more iterative and less expensive especially for the mid range cards After all AMD has been running TSMC 6 nm for Navi 24 and still beating 30 series prices Do you honestly think Nvidia is running so fat a ship that it can't meet AMD on 6 nm for budget cards
3090 to 4090 had the lowest increase in price and the greatest increase in performance kinda defeats that theory
OP adjusted the amount of years for inflation
You are absolutely right 6 years then my bad
It was realistically 200 shortly after launch That s what I bought mine for EVGA gtx 1060 6 GB
Why do people have to buy the best You do realize these sorts of prices have trickle down effects right 30 series are not GOOD VALUE when you're paying launch prices for a two year old GPU ffs This is exactly how Nvidia twists your perception of the situation in their favor You're falling for it
VR primarily MSFS2020 VR still isn't 90fps even on a 3090 When PS5 VR2 comes out PCVR will be a very hard sell when the current graphics card costs more than console HMD
Yeah I don't get where these people come from Probably live in their own bubble where games die and the whole gaming is dead if something isn't constantly happen
Y'all really are naive These higher prices aren't exclusive to high end GPU's If you've noticed the whole bottom of the market has largely fallen out thanks to raised prices GPU's that used to cost 200 now cost 350 This all ultimately going to start pricing out a LOT of people Many got into PC gaming the past 10 years or so precisely because it was relatively affordable to build a gaming PC that could easily outdo what consoles could That idea is dying and I promise you plenty of people will have little issue going back to consoles and the great value that you get from that hardware in comparison to a modern gaming PC If the only requirement is to just 'play games' going with a gaming PC over a console is becoming a far less attractive option
Its what happened though Before the whole 'pcmasterrace' thing PC was a joke with barely any releases compared to console If most of their regular customer base cant afford to keep up then who is gonna develop games that utilize them if 99 of the market cant run it Meanwhile sony can hammer out content that is far superior to the quality of a midrange pc but at a lower price That would be an easy choice for anyone That coupled with the fact that gta6 was just confirmed means a lot of people will buy the ps5 just to play that game and if you already own a ps5 and youd have to invest 2000k in a pc for a better experience that becomes a hard sell PC gaming will still be a thing yes and it will still be better than it ever was but it wont be where the zeitgeist is at anymore i think
Right but a 4060 will cost 500 so now what
That's a reasonable argument for the 4090 which is a 450W card but why would a 4080 12GB which is essentially a 4070 need complex cooling solutions It's a 285W GPU We've had more power hungry cards in the past that ran just fine with simpler cooler designs Even the 16GB version at 320W isn't that bad in terms of power consumption There is no need for complex PCB's neither exotic cooling solutions for anything from the 16GB model and below
What would their chip cost per card have to been increased by in order for their 100 uplift in MSRP not net them any additional profit
the increase in cost of manufacturing due to the much large size of the coolers and complexity of the PCB power delivery 1 The PCB for 4XXX is smaller and less complex than the PCB for 3XXX They are really very tiny PCBs 2 The FE cooler for 4XXX is the same as 3XXX with a marginally larger fan
It is true that cost per transistor is no longer decreasing but this only started happening with the switch from planar to finfet And 30 series despite being made in this post planar era managed to maintain the traditional value gains from new nodes generations at least for the 3060 Ti to 3080 tiers compared to 10 series In no way is 4N so costly that it's double the price of Samsung 8N even with TSMC's price hikes The 4070 and 4080 pricing are simply due to corporate greed and sitting on huge inventories produced for miners that no longer exist In order to sell the existing 30 series inventory they are purposefully pricing 40 series sky high to place them above the existing cards instead of replacing them like a real generation would
Neither of which are expensive at all right now
Don t even think it matters those miners that mine hardcore undervolt the cards even so they should be fine
I feel Like its more about sending a message
Had to make a new account just to tell you thats the dumbest shit ive ever heard The 2060 outperforms the 1080 in new games
Can't wait for the housing market to crash so Blackrock can buy all of them to rent out forever s
This is the correct answer There are still loaded people out there willing to buy all sorts of things It's just us middleclass folks that are priced out atm
Drop is a relative term During the recent madness small crappy houses went for about 320k by me That's largely because that's what resulted in competitive payments to renting a decent one bedroom apartment Working back from that the floor should now be about 275 278 with the most recent uptick in APR to 6 5 It's going to be a very slow correction absent some catastrophic changes
I think he just more meant that there are always buyers willing to overpay pay even for a house
Right but crypto mining is less profitable as energy prices rise And reselling is less lucrative if the economy crashes because unlike housing people don't need to buy GPUs
I'm with you except I offloaded everything sometime before the end of 2021 when people paid eye watering prices for the cards themselves It literally paid for my wedding and honeymoon
You are one of the few with a use case to buy and utilize one I m betting a lot are waiting out what AMD brings and for what prices or the first round of legit game reviews on real world performance versus Nvidia provided ones
Funny enough the 4080 prices are so ridiculous that the 4090 seems like the a gimped 4070 with 10gb that is just slightly better than the current 3080 12gb for 750
That's perfectly fine as a 3d artist I would also love to have one for my workflow
Still nowhere near 2008 levels So far this is a blip
Yet others and even maybe you would have upvoted a derogatory nickname for the previous president if it was him instead of who is in now
Regardless of who you like or not it is correct to call it a recession based on how it was defined literally until we entered this one Some of the most blatant goalpost shifting just so they can control narrative
Except with the re targetting of buyers its not gamers buying Its data centers developers enterprise market There are legitimate rising costs on the manufacturing side for sure Moore s second law noting the doubling of costs per node of assembly plants is noteworthy with plants costing double digit billions also with Apples massive cash reserve in triple digit billions I wouldn t be surprised if they had their own plant at some point But that s not a zero sum issue Orthogonally if you consider how much time Jensen was spending talking about non gaming features at GDC broadcast just a few days ago you can see how their market strategy makes sense selling toward non gamers They re already saturated gaming wise both as a market leader see steam surveys showing 2 3 nvidia and supply wise mining card glut It makes sense to target and develop new market Ultimately they are a business and its not profitable to sell to gamers alone long term
They aren't competing on the node at all Their allocation is contracted ahead of time That's actually what their problem is They have no choice but to pay for the wafers but they have an over stock of 3000 series cards 4000 series is priced not to sell because they want to clear out 3000 series for as much as they can still get for them Apple is not a good gauge for pricing because they're consistently gouging their customers and make ludicrous margins
This relates to the point we are nearing the bottleneck of micro transistors other sectors of computing need to find alternatives to get past these bottlenecks
Net was 10 6 7B in revenue and 656 mil in net income
And then you ll probably just buy a 6000 series because the 7000 will be like 5k
If you want to make sure you can run GTA 6 in 4k 60 in 3 4 years then just buy a new GPU in 3 4 years lol Simple as that
I play in 4K 60 FPS at very high to ultra settings with a 12GB 3060 Diablo 2 Resurrected 100 F1 22 90 Dirt Rally 2 0 90 Automobilista 2 110 Assetto Corsa with every available appearance mod 90 Apex Legends 80 Path of Exile 100 Way of the Hunter 60
If i wanna make sure that i can run GTA 6 in 4K 60 in 3 4 years what card should one buy right now Or is the tech still not there Other than the 3090 variants out now I don't think anything can nbsp This is assuming these games have RT RT is difficult at 4K without DLSS even with dlss the 3080 got choppy at 4K with RT for Cyberpunk at release
Most of the entire RTX 3000 lineup can barely hold or get past 60fps in AAA games This is objective nonsense lol I have no problem maxing out the framerate on my 4k 120hz monitor with the 3080 FE I got almost two years ago
lol if anything in that time the price of their new gpus are going to be up No offense but they're only going to increase the cost not decrease Maybe they will have a GPU that has 4x the performance on their marketing not less
That price was never feasible hence it rising almost immediately That price was totally normal and in line with older GPU generations And Nvidia sold their FE cards all the way from 2020 to now for the MSRP If you could actually get an order in you could get a 3080 for 699 The problem the last two years were the pandemic duh everyone stayed home and instead of going on vacation they got new toys like a gaming PC Couple that with homeoffice and even webcams and other simple PC parts were sold out If you already need a new PC for homeoffice might as well grab a gaming one and mining Everyone who needed a PC during the pandemic has one now and more money is spent on travel again And mining is dead for a week now ETH switched away from PoW to PoS There is no coin out there right now you can mine with your GPU and make a profit on electricity is too expensive and the extra hashpower from ETH is going to those smaller coins making it even worse Nvidia just put the prices this damn high so they could get rid of warehouses full of 30 series cards They are sitting on a lot of them and now the 30 series looks like a deal When 30 series stock goes down and 40 series has low sales numbers they'll 100 go down in price This whole thing is like the last mining boom where every idiot and kid swore the prices will never come down again Hint They absolutely did
The best way to game
Don't buy their 4000 series Don't even buy their 3000 series Either be patient buy used or buy AMD Part of this 4000 series pricing ploy is to make 3000 series cards look like a better deal without adding any actual value to them or reducing their price Make sure Nvidia doesn't get rewarded for this behavior They will literally only listen to their balance sheet
I would sincerely love to see what team Red brings out but I need CUDA cores for iRay rendering DAZ studio Octane renderer and I don't see alternatives available for that
AMD will not do such thing They'll undercut Nvidia just enough to impact those who look at the price perf ratio without many features taken into account but they'll not bring the market costs down almost at all AMD enjoys selling you overpriced GPUs as much as Nvidia does and no way in hell they'll do something just because if it hurts their bottom line If AMD can't compete in performance price is their only option but I suspect that pure rasterisation they'll do just fine against Nvidia so they're gonna cost about the same perhaps 50 100 bucks cheaper at most
Intel is as well And while they are definitely not in the best place yet with drivers they are improving and the cards are super cost effective
yeah all this talk about AMD bringing competition is garbage Their half baked competitor tech is nearly worthless and I STILL can't use their cards for data science projects which is the whole reason I buy a GPU
Amd also charges high prices for ryzen 6000 7000 also radeon cards close to geforce
If they deserve to be humbled they do then they don't deserve return business in the future regardless of whatever meaningless grovelling they perform for the customers that got them this far
Amd cards have like 20gb of ram so expect the price to be high Im assuming at least 800 for the 7800xt
Even if AMD is 10 behind if they're priced right I could care less about dlss 3 0 Another example of an excellent product being destroyed from the top 900 for a 4070 Crazy
Maybe but they're loving this 20 series raised prices across the stack 30 series was a scalper exclusive And 40 series baked the scalper prices into the MSRP Anyone holding out for the 50 series has Jansen's promise that prices are a story of the past God I hope AMD takes them to the cleaners
nVidia likely won't exist in 1 2 years Their CEO is just doing a quick cash grab before burning it all down
3090 and 4090 are the modern equivalent of Titan cards which also used GP102 given their absurd price and unnecessary amount of VRAM They're just marketed more in line with the other gaming cards now
How daft can one person be You even adjusted the prices for inflation so it should be clear how much of scam this is Your PC components total 2186 adjusted for inflation while your current comparable system totals 2050 and is almost an order of magnitude more powerful That's how all technology works from phones to consoles to PCs new gen better than old gen If prices doubled every time performance doubled no one would be able to afford any of these things anymore since salaries aren't being doubled along with them Also you don't even need to buy anything more than a 12600K which is under 300 and would put your comparable system under the 2000 mark Irrelevant The point is to compare the same tier of components The jump in performance from a 1080 Ti to a 4080 is immense nevermind the new technology that's available between these generations The jump from a 7700k to a 12700k is also pretty big and yet by your adjusted for inflation numbers the new gen is actually cheaper I really can't understand how someone could even try to defend nvidia on this and not see that they are trying to take advantage of the crypto boom to keep their prices high Miners didn't care about the price as long as they managed to make a profit It was simple math for them For the average consumer these prices are absolutely ridiculous and a complete scam
You're looking at a demonstrably radically better PC for less cost i mean lol it's many years later no shit it's a better pc what
Yes there is always overpriced stuff meant for X not Y But do you agree with the headline or are they greedy I have never seen a profitable fabrication that didn't become cheaper over time One eventually you pay the overhead if you use all the same equipment Or two equipment skill or whatever else generally improves making it cheaper to make Companies pretend they have an unlimited overhead and that is why they need to charge X dollars But the truth is they have a desire to fill an unlimited profit margin Which is fine just don't pretend
Sure but you can sort of expect some progress when you look at all other industries progressing and so did the GPUs for decades at this point Your point is not invalid per se but to have another generation without perf improvements bar the XX90 which is very expensive to begin with is far from great Your 1080 Ti although probably the best high end GPU ever will show its age terribly when next gen games will finally be launched so it would be great to replace it with a 4080 Ti at a more reasonable price for instance without having to sell your soul
Nope that's what the 7700K retailed for at launch and yeah NVMes were horridly expensive 1080 also launched at 600
You could
I think this is the unfortunate or fortunate reality that we re in at this point The technology is progressing far past the point of diminishing returns 1080p 4K is surely a huge leap but really do most people need 4k for gaming Not really Can most people afford it Definitely not 4K 8K The return is so minuscule I can t tell unless they re side by side How much better can we really push it before it just doesn t matter It s like cars Your average person doesn t need a Lamborghini and probably doesn t really want one But they do want a reliable vehicle that goes fast enough without issue At this point you can either add features make the card more economical or make it smaller but I think we really don t need to focus on better and better GPUs or hardware in general but making it smaller lower power draw and more accessible to more people There s a point where average consumers won t be able to afford these cards I personally was waiting for this series of AMd Nvidia to release to consider upgrading my 6600xt and frankly if this is the roadmap for the future I ll probably just sidegrade it for a 3060ti and in the future just give up modern gaming as a hobby all together There s way way better ways for any individual consumer even upper middle class to spend 1 5k on a consumable wearable non lifetime item At this rate the next generation cards will be 2k or more
They just need to get DLSS or something similar working on that consistently to really make waves Same goes for Intel This tech that Nvidia keeps touting is a double edged sword because it means you don't need as powerful of a GPU to have a decent time playing games as long as maxing the graphics out isn't your main hobby
Yeah have been buying more games than ever no performance issues on my 980 'm interested in doesn't require high end graphics Been playing Peglin lately it's great Max settings lol Seriously if you gave a game like this ultra high end graphics that could make full use of a 4080 how much would it really add to the gaming experience Holocure The Captain Project Zomboid Rogue Legacy 2 Ring of Pain Totally accurate battle simulator The demand for high end cards isn't just constrained to the PC gaming market but even to an even smaller subset of PC Gamers who are really enamored with AAA games That lower quantity demanded can't support the high pricing by itself that pricing was reliant on crypto mining
If you're not running VR then these cards don't matter to you at the moment but there is still room for improvement in the VR space and I suspect that as more next gen games start hitting the market VRAM will start to matter more and more in flat games as well If my 3070 had 12gb of VRAM I wouldn't even consider upgrading for a while but even that card will very quickly lag behind exclusively due to the VRAM Also there are plenty of flat Indie games like Tarkov DCS Minecraft that could benefit from the improved performance already or by indie do you mean pixel platformer
IMHO Its because the real 4090 has been announced yet and the naming conventions shifted 4090 3080 4080 16GB 3070 Ti 4080 12GB 3070 They'll fill out the gaps later with more cards It's just a switching of tactics so they could raise the pricing of their more mid range flagship cards which they know tend to sell more If I were to guess I'm betting in time we'll see at least 2 higher tier 4090 cards made by them maybe even 3
And all 3 of those companies have dealt with Nvidia only once
The Series X is basically an RX 6800 non XT Its not a slouch IMO
It's less about power and more about affordability and the overarching trend of new generation gpus being more and more expensive My only hope is that if the trend continues consoles stay affordable at least then i'd still be able to game in the future
More like 5x and even that doesn't directly translate to the screen in terms of pixel count FPS
GOW Ragnarok
Fair but I want a unique experience not just 4K 120 with max settings I honestly struggle to see a large difference with resolution scaling and anything past 60 frames I feel like and this is especially true back in the days of Deus Ex and Black White that PC had unique things that consoles just couldn't do Even with the Far Cry example it simply couldn't be played on console period versus having a lowered resolution and frame rate
The 4nm is a customized 5nm process iirc not a new node it's a customized node but it's actually an optical shrink of n5p and has higher density and better performance efficiency than the standard node customized node doesn't mean it's not different than standard actually it means specifically that it is different The 4080 16GB has a 380mm die size So its significantly cheaper compared to the 3080 with its 638mm die No absolutely not lol Samsung was dirt cheap because literally nobody else wanted it TSMC is enormously expensive in comparison the cost has probably increased 4x for the same size chip Nvidia is translating a 40 chip cost increaseninto a 300 500 price increase of the card this also just isn't about silicon upfront R D costs both hardware design and software to drive it to fix some of the downsides engineering deficits of modern nodes have absolutely skyrocketed since 28nm That's a 2018 article but nothing has changed and what Jensen is saying is correct there are a lot of articles pre indignant internet pitchfork mob saying the same thing So yeah increasing wafer costs are one piece of the 51m to bring a product to market vs 542m for a 5nm product before you even got to the wafer stage 10x as much upfront R D cost Someone gets to pay that at the end of the day and that someone is consumers Either the price goes up or the generational cycles get longer to allow more time to amortize that cost that's what the math says here That or you use older cheaper nodes like Samsung 8nm samsung 10 or TSMC 12FFN 16FF to keep the cost down A product like Ampere slots into the 10nm category here samsung 8 is a 10 btw You can throw a tantrum all you want but it genuinely does cost far far more to both bring a product to market and to actually manufacture it and at the end of the day that cost has to be passed along Yes it sucks yes things were better in the moore's law days but that's not how things are anymore and having a whinge isn't going to change that Physics is a harsh mistress and at the end of the day this is a very expensive physics problem
I'm aware and I was seriously considering the 6900xt when I saw it for 650 but I don't think it's enough of an upgrade over my RX 5700 considering the money it costs I'm talking about I hope AMDs new generation can be at LEAST as competitive as their 6000 series was with Nvidia Because I've lived through AMD crapping the bed and making a worse product than their last lol
R D costs are recouped and with a good margin btw by their professional and datacenter centric products The gaming cards are a subproduct from those since Turing I can understand the cost increase for the TSMC factory but it doesn't justify the asking price for this new 40 gen or for Turing back then for instance I think nVidia since Turing care less and less every new gen about gamers They invest in pro and datacenter tech and then sell us gamers a subproduct of that when in reality they don't care anymore so they try to become like Apple and ask premium price for those who want and can afford their top tier cards Their current and future profit will not be and are not on gaming The recent GDC presentation was a clear indicator of that where Geforce cards got about 10 to 15 minutes and the real focus was put on Datacenter Automotive and IA development In the future if you will want a gaming card from Nvidia be prepared to sell your soul to the devil first and at some point in time they will stop making GeForce cards because their real profit will be on pro products only
I don't know though I'm very curious to see what happens this time DLSS 3 and a little more firepower is wild I game at QHD high refresh and this gen seems more than fine for the next few years While this is a hardware forum it's important to ask where are the games Where are the games that push the envelope graphically
Both of these things can be true The newest cards are super overpriced but there are a lot of older cards that still perform well in most games These prices will change PC gaming though Building systems yourself has been more expensive than pre built for a while now and these prices will only accelerate that trend Building systems will be even more niche than it already is The success of the Steamdeck will push this trend too PC hardware has always been more expensive than its console counterpart but made up for it with cheaper games But with Gamepass and PlayStation Plus that advantage is also slipping Sure Gamepass is available on PC too but then an Xbox is cheaper than all but the lowest end gaming PCs For most people the value just isn t there Hope I m wrong Maybe AMD will undercut NVIDIA like they did to Intel and we ll have a more competitive market Or maybe the flood of mining GPUs will bring prices down and force them to lower 4000 prices too Keeping my fingers crossed I ve been in this hobby for over 20 years and don t want it to be out of reach for most people
Sure Keep raising prices ad infinitum because there will always be last gen at the same price it was released Doesn't make sense New tech should be either better at the same price or cheaper at the same level of performance Otherwise there is no need for it
3060ti is with 400 RRP same as ps5 without blu ray Way too expensive and 3060ti will also need to be true budget gaming card Mining is gone Nvidia can only dream of insane prices they had
You are talking out of your ass I was a university student living on welfare a decade and a half ago and up until around 2015 it would have taken anyone in that same scenario a few months to save up an extra 2K to 2 5K to buy pretty much a top of the line GPU combined with decent hardware Good luck doing that these days with the cost of living there is no such thing as saving anymore for the teenagers young adults growing up now And those who are single study and work 5 days a week won't even be able to buy a decent PC to enjoy the fucking weekend if this is their main hobby because of these ridiculous prices Instead they have to pray whatever used GPU they're buying is going to work with no warranty or hope they can catch an RTX 3070 for example at the end of its cycle on a discount before it runs out in 5 minutes wherever it drops on special
It is depressing Insane prices for high end hardware these days
There is a small chance they donwhat they did with the Zen cpus and undercut NVIDIA They may also just alightly underprice for instead Will have to wait and find out
Because talk is cheap and easy and gets you imaginary Internet points Action is hard and slow and requires you to sacrifice something
Yep 1269 for the 4080 16Gb FE 949 for the 12GB one
There is no way it is going to be twice as fast
At these prices I bet 30 series stock gets wiped out in a month or two then in time for Christmas 40 series gets price reductions down to what they would've actually launched at had the warehouses not been overflowing with excess 30 series inventory
1679 for FE at the moment and you probably need that much to power the damn card too judging with how expensive electricity is at the moment
Your price expectations here are very low Currency effects alone made it very unlikely to hit those numbers and then you also must consider how much of a deal Nvidia was getting on those Samsung wafers last gen Both 4080s look intentionally overpriced to me but the 4090 is cheaper than I expected
It s not going to end because the 4090 just like the 3090 are being bought by both researchers and companies that are in the AI field I know personally of a company near me that bought 3090s at 2k a gpu because of the time savings that would come with them If anything the xx90 series cards will continue to increase in price
I'm comparing MSRP prices from Nvidia not what AIBs are offering In the US it is literally a 100 dollar difference
What was the price for similar power as a 3090ti on AMD side
Lol
Nvidia and to some extent the AIBs were all happy printing cards while pretending there was no cards gpus were rare and letting the prices rise laughing while people were on FOMO mode buying overexpensive gpus Now they are stuck with a lot of old stock due to their artificial scarcity tactics and sadly I think the consumers will pay and like it They will keep selling the 3000 stock as low mid tier while the 4000 becomes the entusiast dumbconsumer prices tier This will help them clean their old stock the rare cards D they know people sadly pay these prices due to FOMO and 0 impulse control and at the same time they anchor these new prices on ppls brains I mean during the 1000 series if someone told you the 80 series was 800 ppl would be really mad now after the 2000 3000 nostock shenanigans people will thank you for a 800 true 80 series Nvidia can keep doing this and when they want the consumer favour they'll just drop the overprice for a little and consumers will rejoice yay we got a 70 series for only 600 700 sounds like something we could hear now but pre RTX2000 you woudn't and this isn't inflation
Like people are seriously saying Nvidia is making sure that people don't buy their new cards so that they sell the old ones That makes little sense It does make sense the point is that someone who wants the latest and greatest will have to pay more those who want to spend less will have to buy Ampere if they had priced the 4080 at 700 they would never sell the remaining 3080s and 3090s except with a heavy discount which would mean losing profits
They won't jeopardize anything I think their plans are to make a stupidly amount of money from early adopters while they build stock and keep selling them later with a price cut There's a lot of people that has not upgraded since GTX1000 series
Ummm thinking face they probably have hundreds of thousands of 3000 series chips in warehouses due to over production Product that Nvidia already shelled out money to fab So yes they would so that
I'd say both it's a badly optimized next gen game released 1 or 2 years before it's time in terms of visual complexity no other game since has needed a designated 4 or 8 k card for 1080p its also not worth upgrading for i game I've already beaten
I think Nvidia isn't planning for gaming to be their source of income in the future If AI takes off and their chips are good at running 's easy to see where they're going Or want to go That future is a huge opportunity for anyone who can scale it They don't care who buys their chips They care if they can be the big thing going forward and I don't care gaming is going to be the big thing seeing all the other stuff that's growing extremely quickly over the past few years
That is not Moore s law Have the transistors doubled every two years Yes Moore s law is going strong
Yet transistors have still been doubling showing no limit of physics has been reached Nodes have continued to get smaller
Yes I will It's not mandatory but we are being influenced and manipulated into buying shit all the time with hundreds of billions being spent on marketing and ads And companies wanting to sell stuff are killing our planet Wouldn't necessarily call it fair
Yeah I don't get all the pearl clutching just because there exists a gpu that someone thinks is overpriced They aren't holding a gun to your head forcing you to buy this and you don't need to always have the latest and greatest gpu to play videogames My nearly 6 year old 1080ti runs new games just fine
It's not about me affording it it's about corps driving consumers to believe they need new shit every year or two years which is bad for collectively everyone and has huge impact on the planet
What makes us imagine that we are the special generation which will see it end in our lifetime He didn't say it would happen now only that it can't go on forever which is just a basic fact Furthermore please explain how making replacement people under the condition of population non growth fails to drive the demand cycle That just sustains demand Corporations have an expectation of increasing demand and constant growth That was the whole point of the comment I'm not sure what you're not understanding here since it's a fairly simple
You live in the Balkans The inequality between european countries is just incredibly huge Our portuguese neightbours also have incredible low salaries easily 30 40 less than Spain And in France or Germany they pretty much have twice our wages for the same jobs
Median is not the same that most common The average it's about 1750 after taxes Median will be lower then
Hmm it kinda is though X50 entry level x60 cheap midrange there sometimes is a big performance gap here see 960 970 I think it was 2x x70 expensive midrange x80 cheap high end nvidia may confuse this one with the x70 though x90 expensive high end Titan Do you guys not have money technically that applies to all of the cards now but it wasnt always like this So yeah midrange
And yet looking at S
50 lower then am better of buying Nvidia no matter what amd throws out I hardly doubt AMD will have a solid answer for DLSS 3 and RT is still a question Current gen Nvidia took back market throne while AMD was 500 to 800 cheaper in msrp Now 50 Puff
AMD barely sells any cards look at the steam userbase of RX 6000 cards compared to ampere if they have competitive prices they can sell more cards compared to selling less cards for higher money Also AMD gets the T4 wafers for cheaper so its cheaper for them to make the cards
Price wars aren't a bad thing if you know you can win them
would have just scaled down the 40 series to be more iterative and less expensive That' 's also not how consumers or the industry works They'd just get bashed for barely being an upgrade
Unless they're actually taking a loss on the 4090 to position it as a halo product Or the 1599 Founder's Edition will be effectively nonexistent and the only models will be AIB models for 300 400 more
lmao
Will PSVR2 work on PC
is it because of the gpu though without vr at 1440p fs doesn't use more than 40 50 of gpu for me with a 3080
Yeah it's not like consoles are massively over priced at the moment
If most of their regular customer base cant afford to keep up then who is gonna develop games that utilize them if 99 of the market cant run it The market can run it You don't need to run games maxed out at 4k to be able to run it Most people are still on 1080p and older cards do that just fine Meanwhile sony can hammer out content that is far superior to the quality of a midrange pc It's funny you say this when ps5 is famous for it's lack of content That would be an easy choice for anyone The amount of games available on Pc dwarf consoles by a few orders of magnitude That coupled with the fact that gta6 was just confirmed means a lot of people will buy the ps5 just to play that game Is gta6 an exclusive and if you already own a ps5 and youd have to invest 2000k in a pc for a better experience that becomes a hard sell And you if already own a pc you're probably not going to buy into a locked eco system like the ps5 PC gaming will still be a thing yes and it will still be better than it ever was but it wont be where the zeitgeist is at anymore i think PC gaming isn't going to die because bleeding edge tech is expensive A 4 year old card runs every game and beat the consoles so what's the issue exactly
I ve been Pc gaming for almost 30 years and I can assure you it s not and hasn t been a joke PCs have nearly always been faster than consoles and sold lots of games and even had a lot of exclusives
Buy an older gpu
I agree that they're pricing them above the 3000 series to clear stock there My point is just that rising marginal chip costs are going to force GPU prices up absent some breakthrough allowing new nodes to be more economical On Samsung vs TSMC pricing I'm not sure why you think that All the talk I've heard is that Samsung is pricing below TSMC I can't imagine why NVIDIA would opt for their inferior node otherwise I think if anything the pricing discrepancy would be larger since Samsung 8 should have been cheaper then TSMC 7nm and NVIDIA might have missed out on pre covid pricing for their wafer order
The general reason given is not to send a message so if that's the goal it's being done very poorly That's like boycotting a store and telling everyone you don't go there because it's too far away Super effective message
It does Damn I'm retarded
Then rent out Nvidia 4090 cards also
Can't wait for the housing market to crash so Blackrock Blackstone can buy all of them to rent out forever s FTFY
Those people are the middle class You are the poor working class
Also true but until it actually is unprofitable they won't drop Less profitable is still profitable and for some that's enough to continue thier dickish ways It's also possible that GPUs will simply no longer for sale if the cost to manufacture is greater than the price people are willing to pay Which may be possible given supply chain issues and the cost to manufacture continues to rise
the 4090 seems like the 2300 for a 3090 in October of 2020 the 4090 does sound like a bargain But let's see how much they actually sell for especially the partner cards
Until AMD can get an equivalent of CUDA there's no other option for a lot of people
Depends how you measure it Inflation alone is wrecking us This recession is already worse for the working class masses while the only effect plebs like me who didn't get lured into the housing market with ARMs flying around felt in 2008 was a drop in my piddly retirement account which is hardly impactful in the moment Now our paychecks are effectively shrinking every single week that inflation continues to devalue the dollar
Listen idrc what people want to call Defendant Trump Brandon just sounds kinda dumb
Businesses are still making investments jobs are still hiring We are flirting with a recession is the correct way to put it Flirting with a recession caused by 4 years of Donald Trump and his reaction to a pandemic that started during his presidency We will see if the current presidency along with the democratic house and the captive senate can manage to course correct things enough Hopefully we oust enough obstructionist in the fall to have a functioning senate but who knows with voters like you
The stock prices of these top companies are so beyond high that the CEO has to talk about lofty sci fi shit like metaverse omniverse Apple becoming a services company tesla is not a car company etc because if you can t imagine the company 10x ing revenue again in 20 years there is no way to justify the valuation And how can you do that when you re worth close to a trillion and basically captured the entire market for your business Like Jensen has to talk about it self driving cars and data centers and shit because like you said you can t sell that many more gaming chips That s not indicative that they ll stop making gaming chips
They re not required to do anything They are in fact competing with Apple Apple is by far TSMCs biggest customer They gouge their customer lmao okay who cares Apple bids on node time according to how much they can make per wafer That s what nvidia is competing with Reservations are a year in advance but they can and do exchange sell swap allocations with other companies Especially because exact node allocations they want may change TSMC is well aware of the needs of their clients they manage it Trust me I know the business
Oh i was reading ttm net margin
So the question remains why bother spending 1000 bucks for a 4000 card lol We are literally in the transition to next gen games so who are those cards for Your average gamer will most likely be fine with any of the 3000 cards Hell even GTX 10 series cards are still able to run current gen games just fine
RT is difficult at 4K without DLSS even with dlss the 3080 got choppy at 4K with RT for Cyberpunk at release I barely hit 60fps in cyberpunk on 1080p full rt psycho settings without DLSS But I can tell even in 1080p the graphical hit from DLSS so I keep it off I could get better frames but at least for now the few ooh's and aaah's I get I enjoy To be very clear if it weren't there it wouldn't bother me either I saw a video about how Control uses RTX and looks 'so much more realistic' It was just showing in a room where you could see the reflection off framed pictures and I'm like I don't give 2 fucks about that
Bad wording by me fixed it now I meant 4K in native resolution Higher end 3000 cards can still maintain that but who knows if this will hold true for newer games coming out I know that s why DLSS is a thing but if Nvidia starts locking newer DLSS features behind newer hardware it s going to reach a limit where certain versions cards won t be supported anymore
You know old cards are always cheaper than new ones That's how technology works
Hunh Either you aren't getting what they are saying or are bad at math They could buy a 1600 4090 now or wait for a future card that costs less In the 4XXX series if you believe the powerpoint the price for getting 1400 launch price 3090 performance is now about 899 Unless something is different this go round there won't be many games that tax future cards until we get a new gen of consoles There is slight pressure from current gen gaming for more performance at 4k Beyond that NVIDIA is staring at hard times Absent something to load up the card once you hit 240fps at 4k you are addressing a very limited audience in terms of rasterization performance They have to be hoping game streaming takes off or mining on GPUs makes a comeback
It being in line doesn t change the facts The price was never seen outside of founders cards there s a reason for that It wasn t feasible for the AIB s and that lack of margin lead to things like EVGA leaving the GPU market entirely People have their head in the clouds The prices are egregious but they also aren t necessities and you don t need to buy a 4090 The last two years was demand AND supply being insane with reduced demand from miners and an impending recession they are most likely cashing in on people who don t have an issue spending this sort of money The 3090 was already ridiculously priced and yet sold extremely well
If you need Nvidia buy a used 3090 or 3080 ti if you want less mileage on it Don t give Jensen your rent payment
It's tough If you need it for your job there's less of a moral argument behind it so I wouldn't feel so bad But if you can try to buy used Whatever you can do to remove money from Nvidia's pockets They'll only do the right thing if the market demands it
And most the ai code only runs on their cards their research teams are amazing but the GPU production people need to stop the BS pricing maybe license CUDA to AMD so their can be more than one realistic choice for anyone who wants to use a GPU for anything other than gaming
The alternative is redshift which supports AMD gpu However there really is no competition when it comes to the performance of ray tracing with NVIDIA coming up with micromesh tracing we are about to see huge breakthrough with tracing billions of polygons like unreal s nanite AMD is a decade off from achieving the same set of features there really is no competition Just two cents from a rendering engineer
I'm team red and I was excited to see what they had in store after the Nvidia 3k were announced with crazy prices only to see the 6k series from amd barely was a deal compared to Nvidia's announcement I really hope the new amd lineup is affordable love my 5700xt but I really wanna dabble in ray tracing
It is a shame that it's true at least for now If there is demand for it the market will provide AMD will get to that point eventually For the layman there's nothing about Nvidia anymore that's necessary There's not nearly as much exclusive optimization anymore and freesync is just as good as gsync
Install a 1060 or something in your other express slot for those renders unless you need high throughput
AMD would be making a mistake if they do that because now is the best time to entice buyers to try their product many for the first time and potentially secure them for future purchases too
I really really hope Intel can be competitive in the GPU market More competition can only be a good thing
couldn't care less Is 900 for a 4070 a legit price Didn't see that announcement Or do you mean the 4080 12gb
Except they don t get Titan drivers More of a dumb hybrid but either way I think cards of the same chip are more comparable than a 102 is to a 103 Especially a 103 with a 256 bit bus
80tis were price dropped titans tho
please don't leave out how power consumption has also been at play over the years seriously in the age of green I'm not concerned about having the most polished graphics any more i don't care if i have raytracing if it means that i have to insane amounts on other expenditures i want the most power efficient system and i want developer's to optimise their games
What s going on is that some technology such as DRAM and nvme storage has legitimately become cheaper some has leveled off and inflation of the USD has been pretty wild Graphics technology has been the one outlier in the general trend and has been heavily affected by the chaos of the last several years Also just look at nvidia s presentation this week They are heavily tilting toward corporate clients doing intensive non gaming applications who have no problem spending over a thousand dollars for a product delivering the kind of performance that just a few years ago would have been many thousands Nvidia scaled up the architecture to make Titan and even many Quadro workstation products redundant Where they are failing in my opinion is in scaling down to the lowly entry level consumer But margins in that market segment have always been low so if you re a business person doing business which do you prioritize
Appreciate the honest response I don't necessarily believe the headline Anything could change He's a CEO of course he is just trying to create an environment beneficial to his company even if he says misleading things I'm just saying transistor costs have been increasing with these newer nodes So not only is nvidia paying more per transistor they are also buying more transistors So naturally the cost to produce GPUs has gone up not down I have never seen a profitable fabrication that didn't become cheaper over time One eventually you pay the overhead if you use all the same equipment Or two equipment skill or whatever else generally improves making it cheaper to make Tsmc admits to raising prices on some of their nodes so yeah the prices can increase Last year
GPUs are still progressing What data leads you to the conclusion there has been no progression in GPUs Your last point is just saying wouldn't it be nice if GPUs were cheaper Yes but I could apply that to everything I purchase
I looked it up 7700K was 340 at launch and you were correct about the 1080 I probably never saw that horrendous ssd cost cuz I stuck with the sata m 2 until only getting a 250GB Samsung 960 evo I m assuming you bought a high end model ssd though as well Like Evo vs Pro
The 3080 is definitely more capable than any gpu in the consoles that are out rn and will be until the next generation of consoles 2027 and there will definitely be like 2 more generations of better cards than the 4080 from both amd and nvidia if they keep following the 2y per GPU refresh they've been doing recently im in the same boat with a 3080 and i'm just gonna wait another 2 4 years and i'll probably be fine lol
FSR bro This is a problem users who are misinformed or can't find the info FSR 2 1 was recently announced Go check out the highlights
If you re not running VR then these cards don t matter to you at the moment but there is still room for improvement in the VR space and I suspect that as more next gen games start hitting the market VRAM will start to matter more and more in flat games as well I m still not convinced that a 3000 VR setup is ever going to hit the mainstream especially when things like the Oculus Quest exist and based on sales are extremely popular If you want to spend that much on the hardware you do you but plenty of far cheaper and readily capable options already exist Aso there are plenty of flat Indie games like Tarkov DCS Minecraft that could benefit from the improved performance already or by indie do you mean pixel platformer are you seriously suggesting you need a 4090 to play Minecraft
I'm glad I got a 16 GB AMD vega card though I suspect a lot of the VRAM has been going to waste lol Personally I'm waiting for an 8k capable GPU since I invested in an 8k screen unfortunately Vega doesn't seem to support DSC which I would need for an 8k DisplayPort 1 4a to HDMI 2 1 adapter It felt like it took ages for 4k adoption middle finger1440p My personal dream would be 4k120 gaming in a 17 laptop at 50 watts which would be 1080p60 in a handheld at 7 watts with linear scaling And then 8k120 at 200 watts with 100 extra watts of headroom for higher resolutions or refresh rates
A gaming PC equal to console performance has always costed around 2x that of the console price That still remains true to this day and I don't really expect that to change Like are you people seriously pretending like a 4080 is in the same realm as a console They are 2 completely different realms of performance If you aren't in the market for top of the line hardware then wait for the mid tier hardware to release then if that is way more expensive then bitch about that Seeing people complain about the price of top tier cards that were never the targeted audience for these cards is just wild
Affordability still exists in their lower end cards These aren't being made to game on they're being made for power users who do large video editing scientific modeling AI or other tasks which benefit from massive GPU power Most games will run great on their mid tier or even low tier card for that gen
Eh my opinion goes against the popular Nvidia bad in every possible way sentiment So I fully expect to get downvoted The price of the 4080 is absurd we can all agree on that but like if you weren't in the market for a 4080 in the first Even mentioning consoles means you weren't ever the targeted audience for these types of cards The 80 line has always been for enthusiasts They are complete overkill for anyone who has a normal setup
Ragnarok is easily played on a 3080 are you out of your mind
Every company wants to be more like Apple because of how successful Apple is If people stop putting up with that shit from Apple amd stop buying Apple products other companies will stop trying to adopt Apple's corporate culture The gaming industry as a whole hasn't cared about gamers for years now It's been trying to become another Hollywood for the past 2 decades The idea that X company or CEO cares or doesn't care about gamers means absolutely nothing these days Nobody involved with any part of the big money gaming industry cares about gamers Stop thinking that they do It's not a thing Anyone that tries to tell you otherwise is just trying to establish a parasocial relationship for marketing purposes Jensen Huang is a man who built a company that designs parallel processors His job is to make great chips make those chips as useful as possible and sell all of those things for lots of money Dr Lisa Su has the same job Pat Gelsinger does too These people care most about whomever is willing to pay top dollar for their products
Let's just forget about the global chip shortage sky high global inflation global supply chain issues increase in transport costs and TSMC raising their prices across the board The 40 series is literally advertised 2 4x faster than the 30 series Those are pretty huge improvements There are absolutely people out there with the need for the top end GPU just not gamers on tight budgets
Ok then get a 1660 Super on Amazon right now for 220
If you can pick up 97 or 98 of the performance for roughly half the price they will fly off shelves this time around Seeing the tech reviewers speaking out openly about it the comments here and on other sites there's quite a bit of people upset at nVidia already Hopefully this time it isn't all squeeky wheels and is legit the mass
It doesn t draw any more power than last gen
6900xt is 90 average performance for about 50 price
Yeah I guess all the dummies are out here making money and these 5 head mega minds are broke as fuck Lol indeed
Let's see if the used market booms as many people predict which could very well screw the plans of getting rid of the new 3000 series stock As well as the 4000 series if the value proposition stays unchanged for long This could also give amd a nice time window to come up with a proper mid range performance price product
That's it They just want to get rid from the RTX 3000 series so they force people to choose between an outdated overpriced product or the new ones even more overpriced
Strix 970 I was looking to get the 4070 the fake 4080 12gb at 550 650 or 4080 real one 16gb at 700 800 I wanted a 3080 but we all seen how that went and no way am I paying anywhere near msrp of a two year old card I guess I'm waiting on what AMD has and if they have what I want in the price range I want I'll buy that and if not then when I do build a new PC in the next year or so it probably wont be a gaming PC I've got other hobbies
So yes they would so that U 't There is literally no way they deliberately jeopardize their 4000 cards for any reason They will simply have the two generations of cards coexist and sell the 3000 as the lower end models and the 4000 as the higher end ones Those prices are here to stay as far as Nvidia is concerned The idea that they will cut the 4000 series prices after they sell the 3000 cards is just pure cope I love how everyone in this thread has latched on to a far fetched theory and are acting like I'm crazy for not accepting something that they completely made up
I'm playing it with a 3070 just fine at 1080p With DLSS at quality I can turn on all the RT settings and still maintain 70 90 fps indoors and 60ish fps outdoors
Right But the new part is they cost more That's the diminishing returns
Yet here you are on a capitalist's social platform that is profiting by selling your information and shoving ads down your troath and you're doing it using a device made by capitalist companies that you are funding with your money If you don't agree with the capitalistic model you're free to do it but don't be a hypocrite and bring up the question just because a company has made a product that you can't afford or are unwilling to buy or even worse just to not concede in an internet argument By the way to go back to your previous comment consoles are still a capitalistic tool what you don't see is that their business model is no longer based on selling you the hardware but on getting you into their ecosystem so that you will continue to pay as long as you use the console Sony and Microsoft often sell their hardware at a loss because the real revenue comes from services you pay for you're still getting milked just in a different way
He didn't say it would happen now only that it can't go on forever which is just a basic fact This is a distinction which fails to distinguish If it's not going to happen soon then it's not going to affect Nvidia in general or CEO Huang's declaration in particular rendering OC's comment gibberish That just sustains demand Corporations have an expectation of increasing demand and constant growth No they don't Marxists pontificating about the inevitable course of history like to tell us corporations have an expectation of constant growth Meanwhile the dynamics of the business cycle are still taught and well understood at the undergrad level The Nvidia corporation was founded just after a recession has survived two major economic downturns in the years since and understands it faces yet another shock presently Not constant growth you see
Indeed With 600 700 euros a month you are generally considered to be doing ok It s livable if devoid of any luxuries The problem is that the minimal wage is 360 euros and a shamefully large part of the population lives with that or lower Thank God I earn more however all things considered those prices here just seem out of touch with reality I might have the cash but I will not be buying one at that price point it s just not right
Unless you are a decent programmer in which case you get a netto salary almost as good as in Germany and you can buy a 2 room condo for 100000 in a decent city without needing to rent for life like many germans have to do
Median is the best indicator of reality since it literally means that 50 of people make that much or more
This gpu will run every game you throw at it at 4k with nearly max settings Calling this midrange is moronic its a bleeding edge piece of tech that hasn't even been released yet
How do you know dlss 3 is even worth it Because of one commercial sell from nvidia
Yep 50 Not worth it Also 50 than a 4080 is a joke The price should be 599 just like it used to be
I hardly doubt AMD will have a solid answer for DLSS 3 and RT is still a question Even if they did you'd just find another excuse RTX Voice NVEnc Gsync drivers There's always some bs justification for Nvidia stalwarts to hold their noses up and still buy Nvidia and AMD is done killing their ASPs for your benefit Nothing new here All you want is cheaper Nvidia cards and AMD doesn't exist to help you with it
True for 50 it really doean't make sense to get AMD but if its like 200 300 cheaper than it would be huge W and that can actcually happen since AMD gets the T4 wafers for cheaper than nvidia
RT is a decade behind but who cares if your demography doesn t care about RT anyway AMD users just want fast frame time in rasterization and they are striking that pretty well
Nvidia usually comes up with the cool technology like G Sync real time ray tracing and DLSS then AMD usually implements something similar but is usually a generation behind
I think your are mistaking selling loads and making loads AMD was easily selling most of not all GPU's they made during the last 2 years Be it to bots scalpers cypto people and regular people Its just that they don't make nearly as many as Nvidia due to their CPU focused share at TSMC The amount of wafers going to GPU's is relatively small in comparisons to what Epyc and Ryzen are getting
AMD barely sells cards because they spent most of the wafer allocation on EPYC dies from 2020 to mid late 2021 since they were very high margin vs low margin but profitable People absolutely did buy RX 6800 6800 XT and 6900 XTs when they were available but they were basically vaporware for a year What no one bought were 900 1000 6700 XTs since a bit more money even with scalper pricing got you a whole lot more card either further up in the stack or from NVIDIA Edit wafer
The 6000 series prices were relatively competitive though so surely they should ve sold more I think another reason why AMD sold less cards was due to negative reputation they got from the 5000 series as well as poor marketing compared to Nvidia You re right in saying that they could sell more cards at a lower price and extract similar revenue But profits would still fall A monopolist naturally will produce less at a higher price because that s where the profit maximising point is according to microeconomic theory Maybe in the long run a larger market share would result in higher profits but shareholders are short sighted and want immediate results ie higher prices
It's literally what they're doing by naming a 4070 a 4080 WDYM
People paying the current inflated to fuck asking prices is what causes high pricing Companies will charge what they can get by with and crypto showed them that was a lot But now people aren t making shit with crypto so they need to temper their expectations Anyone who buys at this price is just making things worse
I'm pretty sure it won't but in this day and age you never know
They aren't One time buy for like 6 8 years
PC gaming isn't going to die because bleeding edge tech is expensive Not die but it will shrink as a market in time And the side effect will be that devs pubs start going back to heavily prioritizing consoles
Is gta6 an exclusive Considering every other GTA game since 3 has been console first by more than a year I'd say it by far most likely yes
Samsung is obviously pricing below TSMC due to the fact that their nodes are simply inferior but my point is I don't believe the price hikes are justified by wafer pricing alone Sure a comparably sized Lovelace die to Ampere might be up to 50 more expensive to produce but prices have increased by much more than that 70 80 for the 4070 and 4080 edit In addition Nvidia's margins are already insane so they could afford to take a hit regardless Instead they're trying to have their lunch and eat it too edit 2 AMD also already proved that RDNA2 on 7nm wasn't that much more expensive than Samsung 8nm Yes TSMC will be charging Nvidia higher for ditching them but again I can't fathom it would be that high
I mean using that example it would be more like Nvidia only selling in one specific country The better analogy imo would be buying used green shirts with holes because the only green shirt manufacturer is pricing them like a goldbar
Isn't that a thing Geforce Now
Ahh could just swap out the Blackrock with 'major investment firms' Just read that it wasn't Blackrock buying up individual homes though so thanks for that check
Damn you didn t have to call me out like that smiling face with tear
That's true it's primarily why I use a 3080ti
Just because you didn't get an ARM in 2008 and or didn't get affected by it doesn't mean it wasn't bad More people were affected than not There were traders and executives jumping off of buildings because it was so bad What we're in now is objectively nowhere near the level of 2008
My point exactly well played
Flirting with a recession If you go by the new definition that came out after we hit the requirements for how they've been Blatant goalpost shifting for political reasons dishonest behavior Please try to grow up past stupid red vs blue crap none of those people are on your side at all
The economy was doing well until Covid hit The unemployment rate for Black people was at an all time so it doesn't get any play Biden shut down a large American oil pipeline project Keystone XL He also lifted sanctions that Trump imposed on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline Funny the media doesn't mention Biden's pro Russia actions
No but the actual market strategy is They re pricing themselves out of gaming for the foreseeable future The trend is to sell towards other markets Will new gpus be affordable again We ll see However this immediate next quarter Definitely not
I guess they are for those hardcore and wealthy enthusiasts who absolutely need to switch to the best tech every gen because their life would be miserable with a last gen card lol
I might get one of I didn't already have a 3090 Got an FE from BB a year ago when 3080s were unobtainium As things stand I will probably wait out this generation
I've paid attention to nothing about the 40xx cards besides the price However besides enthusiasts and people with just more spending money not mutually exclusive I thought others would have been people in industry where this could enhance their workflow Time can be money to them
If you do DLSS at highest quality is it really noticeable I didn't like dlss until the more recent upgrades now it's hard to see much of a difference Especially during fast action nbsp I put everything to max on 1440p and dlss quality On occasion it will will drop to the high 20's but usually im in the 40's 50's in the city
All good I sort of disagree there too the vast majority of games I play admittedly multiplayer scream at 4k on my GPU Others like Elden Ring have a 60fps cap others like Doom Eternal scream even with RT enabled It really depends If you want to play Cyberpunk or MSFS then you ll get better results as you go up but the value is still questionable to me but then again I would never spend over 1000 on a card so I m the wrong guy to be talking about that As for DLSS Frame Generation by the time software comes out that demands an upgrade from the 3080 there will be another generation of cards that may be worth considering then I had my 1080 for four years and I expect the same out of my 3080 If I was coming from Turing I d certainly be waiting to see what the performance on the 4070 cards end up like and then deciding between that or the 4080 12GB Cheers
This is objective nonsense lol I have no problem maxing out the framerate on my 4k 120hz monitor with the 3080 FE I got almost two years ago Cyberpunk is the benchmark barring Crysis coming out AFAIK there are only a very few other game that stresses down video cards at or worse than Cyberpunk and many that do not stress the cards nearly as hard and look absolutely phenomenal I think we will have no probs whatsoever running 'next gen games'
More like how inflation and rising costs work along with market trends It should be obvious to everyone that new shit costs more than old Nope some people are delusional Edit Also its clear some people have no clue about economics
The 3090 was already ridiculously priced and yet sold extremely well The 3090 only sold well because it was a monster for mining No other reason there If mining didn't exist it would have sat in the shelves just like an overpriced 2080 Ti My 3080 TUF paid itself off with mining ETH while I wasn't gaming on it and I got it for only 762 That's pretty much MSRP for a non FE card The used market is absolutely full to the brim with 3090 cards lol They definitely weren't used for gaming I could literally pick up a 3090 for just 800 right now
Tons of used 3090s on market right now with crypto whackos offloading their stock after the ethereum switch to proof of stake I've seen a few as low as 600 and most all of them are 3 digits
Damn TF2 is going to look soooo good with this shit
Yeah amd are great for gaming but some applications really benefit nvidia tech I use blender snd really want RT cores in my next gpu
Yep Looking at what Nvidia do for computer graphics research AI and high performance computing simply puts AMD to shame I get that a lot of people love AMD for being that budget option but it comes with basically no extras Nvidia has a lot of value added software and cutting edge technology that is extremely useful for all sorts of work and often helps in gaming QoL G Sync MFAA DSR DLSS etc Not everything will survive not everything will hit mass adoption but I like that they're at least pushing for new things rather than waiting for someone else to do it then copy it and get crowned the people's hero There wouldn't be any copies if there wasn't innovation to begin with
Yeah the latest APIs shift the optimization burden onto devs and away from GPU drivers In my experience freesync is better than gsync AND cheaper Nvidia supporting freesync displays was a quiet admission of this DLSS GeForce Now is Nvidia's biggest advantage but AMD is hot on their heels Ray tracing is a nice extra but I wouldn't base my purchasing decision on that I see RT as more of a future proofing feature so that in 2033 when we have the RTX 9080 to we can really appreciate Control and Cyberpunk as we were meant to
Absolutely AMD is no slouch and I have faith they will have someone something competitive in a few years time Nows the time to pour that money into R D catch your enemy resting on its laurels
Tempting as that would be I have concerns if my 850w PSU would be up for whatever AMD has in conjunction with running a 2080 ti in tandem If I end up spending the same anyway new PSU might as well keep it simple
Especially because Nvidia certainly has room to come down further If AMD tries to undercut them by 50 100 Nvidia can just lower their prices by 50 or so and then AMD's value proposition is gone Unless AMD then responds with price cuts but doing that right after your announcement is a pretty bad look
It ll be well over half a decade before I think they can be truly competitive
When they all agree to sell for about the same price competition loses a lot of its edge People will just stick with what they know no reason to give a different manufacturer a try
LTT did a video recently with a very efficient PC I think less than an old style light bulb
No you didn't get it and the guy explained it very well It's not about being cheaper it's about progress and comparing it to other markets If you look at CPUs SSDs it's to spot it not so much with GPUs unless you are ready to pay a lot for it
No i am saying that the 4090 opens up possibilities in minecraft that are not there now
then why would you care Because by your own admission the prices are absurd What if nvidia priced these cards at 10 000 Would but you aren't the target audience still be a valid counterpoint
Well not least for the next year or two
You're talking as if manufacturers are leaving previous generations in the cycle for consumers to purchase An RTX 3080 is still 1300 in Australia an RTX 3070 is still 1000 unless it gets heavily discounted happening these days barely dropping below 900 sometimes By the time these cards hit a reasonable price for most budget gamers they will be out of stock and the new generation would have taken over Exactly the same as what happened with the Turing generation overpriced all the way until it went out of stock This is why you have the majority of gamers still stuck with Turing or prior generations of Pascal or older x200B I wouldn't have an issue with your argument if for example the 4000 series releases at the end of this year for 1400 1800 2200 in Australia more reasonable prices while they also sell the 3000 series for 500 700 and 900 But the reality is the 3000 series will run out of stock deliberately designed that way by nVidia and then the 4000 series will keep being priced out of the majority of consumers x200B As to all the shortages inflations and other prices that applies to every other product in the market including the NEEDS Shelter Food and Water costing an arm and a leg making the people on budget and even those with decent wages priced out of the PC gaming market once again x200B RTX 2070 Super used is still selling for 600 to 800 in Australia btw that's how F'ed our market is here
3060ti is a bit better than ps5 but cost as whole console 1660 is much worse Why anyone would do that
I'm not including the 12GB variant Let's not normalize this The 12GB isn't a 'variant' It's an entirely different GPU and product altogether It just straight up isn't a 4080
I think they are hoping people will go so this is a great deal or banking on coporate purchase for ML or other professional use
Well I can't comment on how other prices are in other countries but if it is worse then that sucks
I sure hope so I'm still waiting on an excuse to buy a new pc I really just need a small excuse and these last years I feel I cannot make a purchase without feeling ripped off in some way and that just stops me in my tracks
thanks Good to know what cpu and how much ram have you got if i ever upgrade in the next 2 years the minimum requirement is going to be CP77 max on 1080p
Loooool literally a meme opinion you hate society yet you participate in it Cheers for the laugh
Lol ok Yet when it doesnt meet constant growth goals outside recessions then stock prices tumble Get out of here with that nonsense
As an American I can't even justify this and I make your country's average wage by midway through the work week Obviously our cost of living is astronomical but I'm aware that even if we have the same percentage of expendable income mine stretches MUCH further for luxuries such as this
Actually I work as programmer and most of us earn about 1600 2200 Some have better wages but only a few We do better than most of people but still are quite far from the rest of europe The best thing you can do here as a programmer is learn english get a decent spoken level and search a remote job for another european country you can easily get 3000 month and even work a few less hours by day
Within the lineup of RTX 4000 cards this thing is midrange thats just how it is how it has been for 20 years now The fact that consoles are the new baseline that makes upcoming GPUs overpowered doesnt mean that entry level GPUs suddenly become high end My 6900XT doesnt suddenly change from high end within its stack to midrange just because a 7900XT appears or a 4090 it still is a high end card just an older one EDIT Also no it wont run UE5 games at 4k60 or so especially since the actual 4070 would end up somewhere around 3080 performance in Rasterized rendering all maxed out maybe a 4090 can but even that I am not sure about since there isnt really a 2x improvement for non RayTracing just 60ish Just wait for the new games in a few years and see how the high end 4070 turns into potato tier for we simply do not have actual Next Gen games on PC or any real UE5 game that uses all the features etc its all old stuff or games that have to cater to the old and new consoles which means that they are held back too
Anything that is improvement is improvement end of excuse while those that you mentioned are minor things especially compared to dlss and RT Basically what you are saying is we are done losing money because we can't compete fine then even easier choice lol
Unfortunately I m stuck with Nvidia for the one thing they actually do have Near universal support from software vendors They ve locked in a lot of software in such a way that CUDA or related backend support is frankly better than anything AMD cards can handle I wish it wasn t the case but time is money and if Nvidia give a card that can do X in Y speed and Y speed is better than AMD then they ll have that money
I seriously doubt they will x200B Nvidia usually comes out with something like G Sync or DLSS then around a year later AMD comes out with a competitor like Freesync or FSR
RTX Voice NVEnc Gsync drivers These things are actually nice and generally work right out the gate AMD products do not have a comparable suite of value adds like that Additionally AMD drivers have been an issue for years Having purchased a 1700x 3900x and 5900x AMD products might perform equivalently to their competitors or even better but the product experience does not have the same level of polish which matters to a lot of people Learning to manually tune DDR4 was a chore It's like comparing two cars with similar horsepower but one has remote start heating seats Android Auto and Apple Car Play etc If someone just craves a fast car at a cheaper price they'll take that option over the more expensive one with the aforementioned features You're complaining about Nvidia stalwarts on r nvidia and acting like AMD is part of your identity No corporation gives a single fuck about you
Amd doesn't get wafers cheaper wafers are set price is just that more chips are on wafer therefore more space is used cheaper because you make more cards out 200 300 is more promising and most likely the case but still Nvidia is more premium product brand from start they support more features AMD let's face it FSR won't compete with dlss 3 Dlss is literally generating more frames and taking load of CPU this is f huge RT I have feeling like AMD is going to say that they are aiming for better RT than 3090ti and not 4000 series I just have that feeling and is not the first time AMD done this So then those 300 can still become questionable even for non Nvidia fanboys
It's a generation behind give or take but as you say if you don't play many RT games who cares
Consoles too
They don't scale it down chips funny turn out not as good so it gets rebranded
It would be the dream wouldn't it I have a Rift S that Oculus decided to stop supporting 6 months after I bought it If I lose a controller or a cable I'm screwed I already have a PSVR and will absolutely get PSVR2 and it would be my main VR headset if it could do PCVR and PS5
You can buy a gpu and use it for that long as well if you want too
That's because their leveraged bets on a derivatives market they didn't understand blew up in their faces and wreaked havoc in one of the foundational bricks of our economy Very impactful to them not nearly so for the entirety of society And the market hasn't bottomed yet
It s not a derogatory nickname he s literally in court as a defendant right now
We ve sorta reached the peak though right Like they need to come up with something brand new like they did with ray tracing and I don t think it exists VR gaming hasn t really become a thing 8k is not there Games can t really have that many more triangles at the current screen size and resolution I don t think gamers need giant fucking dies from the latest and greatest nodes anymore People keep talking about rewarding punishing nvidia That s not what s going on Probably TSMCs prices will go down for the 4nm node Then they ll release smaller dies that are a much better value proposition
Anyone with a 3080 or 3090 shouldn't need an upgrade until at least like 2024 or 2025
I tend to despise the term 'enthusiast' because it's become a word that defines a very small subset of people in the eco system who buys because they can and defends themselves as 'enthusiasts' because they have the best card I believe anybody who is enthusiastic about the business is an 'enthusiast' I consider myself A 'lowly' 3080 12gb owner an enthusiast Can I do full RTX 4k at 120fps No But I am interested in the flow of things in the industry and find it fascinating Just like I haven't had every current gen console system ever but up until the PS4 Xbox one gen I considered myself a console gaming enthusiast because I had up to that point really enjoyed the in's and out's of the business with that ecosystem But in reality people who enjoy games in general and are excited to see play and talk about new and old forms of gaming in general are in fact also enthusiasts
On occasion it will will drop to the high 20's but usually im in the 40's 50's in the city If you have a 1440p or 4k monitor yes the higher the resolution the better DLSS looks but on 1080p your basically having to suffer from a crappy looking end result if you turn it on
Yeah I m still on a 1070 and while it still holds up pretty well you can tell it s starting to struggle with newer games being released I m looking to upgrade soon but the 4000 cards are pretty much out of the question unless the prices for them drop tremendously I could of course wait for prices of the 3000 cards to drop and get a 3080ti or so but the thought of buying 2 year old tech at this point just doesn t sit right with me But again the prices will dictate this decision So AMD really has to position itself well and they will earn a lot of new customers Even though I prefer NVIDIA but they have been giving us the middle finger for so long now If AMD goes the Nvidia Route as well I will either have to go along with my 1070 or overpay for a new GPU
Demand will ultimately determine the final price of these objects
What the fuck are you on For the love of fuck yes new shit costs more than old but graphics cards have not just linearly gone up in price even adjusted for inflation for generations now There's literally been graphics plastered all over reddit about previous gen xx80 and xx90 cards and their original MSRPs plus adjusted for inflation and they don't double every generation You have no fucking idea what point you're even trying to argue beyond durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr prices change i'm smart about economics What the fuck is this comment Also even not accounting for lE EcoNomICs the consumer base is heavily affected by FOMO so old generation cards always see at least a little bit of a downturn in pricing especially on second hand markets once a new generation comes up because the demand especially for high end consumers shifts from the previous generation to the current generation Electronics do not go up in price due to being vintage or old school At the very worst you just wait for the 5000 series to go up and you can find used 4090s some that have only been used once for example like a 3000 series card I just bought recently for a fuck of a lot less than the 4090's current price even adjusted for inflation Get your head out of your ass mister economics expert
3090 also sold because it was a monster for professionals without being stupid expensive That VRAM really helps
Gaming is gaming it s a different sector But what I mentioned above is used in all forms of media you see everyday be it TV series ads and even movies GPU rendering has come a long way
I think this is why Nvidia care less about gamers now They are now looking toward corporate customers
I expect only one card will really draw significant power at the same time
yeah that really depends on what card you have
None of those things were in demand the same way GPUs were and complexity of an intel CPU as well as the technology it drives has not changed nearly as much You seem like an nvidia shill Takes 10 seconds to look at my post history and see that I plan on switching to AMD if they offer better this fall 10 seconds
Are you saying all technology must progress at the same rate at all times or are you saying GPUs have not progressed
Yes If you weren't going to buy one then why would you care what the price was In the same way I don't care about the price of Gucci purses or whatever Now would I personally care probably but I am the targeted audience for this tier of card That said I'm not surprised at all by the price lol the 4080 12GB is stupid but if it ends up beating the 3090 TI then I think the price is mostly fine their marketing surrounding it is just cancer But like as a teen I didn't give a fuck what the price of the 1080 or the Titan were I wasn't going to buy them regardless as they were out of my price range I cared about the 1060 and 1070 If you are in the market for a 4070 then wait for the 4070 If the price of that ends up being absurd then you have a good reason to complain I don't forsee Nvidia releasing the 4070 any higher than 550 but we will see
Well that wasnt the question he was talking about the performance of the 3080 not the available games it can play or cannot play But yes it wont be for a year or two
3080 and 3070 is not for budget gamers and their prices reflect that The GTX 1660S offers great performance for price There's good cards for every budget out there on the market from 200 A bunch of these posts sound like I can't afford the newest iPhone this year cries
The versatility that comes with having a pc that plays games vs just a console is big And a 1660 Super should play most anything you want at 1440p medium settings 100fps which is basically what a PS5 does And id rather have a pc with a 12400f than PS5s zen2 cores You csn even get a 5800x for 255 right now on Amazon So if youre willing to spend a little more for that processor and a 3070 lets say you ll have a pc that will smoke a console and last for years
The 2 000 3090Ti FE just sat in Best Buys at a time when people were still frantically buying all the GPUs they could find It was too expensive then and it's triply too expensive now that mining is dead
Okay buddy good to know you pay your employees a shit wage maybe some of them are in here crying about not having enough money for a GPU they can t afford because their employer sucks
12700F 16GB DDR4 3200MHz dual channel
Cost of living isn't astronomical that is excluding healthcare Comparing the average US city to a Balkan capital say Nashville TN to Sofia Bulgaria it's something like 2 1
A few is a huge understatement every senior developer in Romania who switched at least two companies which means quite a lot of people earns about 3000 netto and if you don't it's time to brush off your CV this is literally a standard salary in 2022 and I'm not even including working as a contractor and not paying so many taxes as an employee which easily doubles this amount but that's more risky so that's that In Germany a senior guy makes about 4000 but just the rent alone ruins the advantage Z rich London do pay significantly better and allow for higher saving rates but depending on the lifestyle they can get very expensive too For everything else the Balkans win hands down in this domain unless you work in the US that is
So if I buy a 1080 I'd technically have a high end card Again that's silly
I mean find your excuse Just don't act like you need anything from AMD outside helping as leverage for negotiating lower Nvidia GPUs It's disingenuous AMD will sell their chips at fair value Unlike Nvidia Radeon isn't a big part of their revenue base and they will simply redirect wafers to DC and Semi custom if their channels get backed up Now since they have lower gross margin expectations than Nvidia I'd expect them to blow the 4080s out of the water anyways Navi 31's 308mm N5 and 6 dirt cheap N6 chiplets is probably cheaper than AD103 Those profits are theirs to keep not give you Nvidia is welcome to start a pricing war if they want Put simply they should have all the cards this gen But the idea that they should strategize around giving Nvidia stalwarts a leg up is silly We saw it play out with Intel hello Rocket lake purchasers Those that bought Intel regardless bought Rocket lake AMD just focused on more objective consumers
That's absolutely fair and you can see I didn't add that to my list Pro users still have no choice They still make up a sliver of the captive audience crowd however
You're complaining about Nvidia stalwarts on r nvidia and acting like AMD is part of your identity No corporation gives a single fuck about you I'm complaining about irrational purchase decisions and how that affects prices for me If Nvidia stalwarts actually bought the better performance add ons included card AMD wouldn't give up on competing with performance As is they wait for Nvidia to first mover the new pricing tiers then undercut them slightly for maximum return That's on Nvidia stalwarts 're undermining the competitive marketplace you so desire by never actually rewarding the better value products with a purchase
DLSS 3 generates more frames but it causes latency and other problems there is always a downside to these upscaling techniques also some leaks show that AMD will have hardware accelerated FSR for RX 7000 If their RT performance is between 3000 and 4000 thats perfectly fine the 6000 series can barely beat the 2080ti also i personally won't spend 300 more for DLSS 3 0 so does Nvidia fanboys thats why there are still posts about people getting 3080 12gbs for 600 instead of waiting for the 900 4080 12gb even after the reveal
Artists gamers are not the only demographic these cards are targeting
For sure Looks like an amazing headset
That's true but most people don't do that Consoles also provide a more satisfactory gaming experience over that period
Very impactful to them not nearly so for the entirety of society 2008 affected first world countries globally It was very impactful It's known as the Great recession At the time the International Monetary Fund IMF concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression E2 80 932008 Right now we have no subprime or predatory lending and the main contributor is simply inflation This is nothing at all like 2008
VR will happen but being able to drive it to the standard ordinary people expect from the marketing with affordable GPUs is just not a reality yet PSVR may change this if they make eye tracking an industry standard I still think it's got massive potential and we're still just waiting for the tech to catch up and make quality experiences beyond glorified mobile games affordable
Meh it could be faster Cyberpunk still feels laggy with ray tracing options turned up I would like to be playing 100ish fps at 4k with ray tracing turned up Late 2023 early 2024 might be the right time point
Ah okay
Good luck with whatever card you get in the future Just know that even the 3080 10GB will drive the vast majority of games at native 4k with no problem Also know that high percentage render scale as well as DLSS depending on the game ofc also works extremely well I actually gamed on my 4k display with a GTX 1080 until I got my 3080 I didn't play at 4k native but I did play at 1440p which on a 4k display looks identical to a native 1440p panel side by side The pixel density and scaling made it indistinguishable It is unfortunate that oversupply led to these insane prices but also know that these are all terrific cards with 4k displays and will serve very well for years to come I was lucky enough to get a 3080 FE for MSRP during the second week they were available and it will likely end up being the best value performance I've had in my 25 years oof building gaming PCs and this is at 4k
Yeah but professionals don't care about the price that much They either buy a A5000 3 598 GPU or a 3090 for cheap Though the 3090 doesn't have the full feature set I was talking about gaming Gamers balked at the price of a Titan card sure there were literally a handful who bought them for gaming but they were crazy outliers
The same high performance computing customers will drive tech for le gamerz don't worry We 3D guys need faster cards and Nvidia delivers And with that come all the 3D features that trickle down to games
They have progressed but they are literally the only tech market in the world where the perf stagnated in the last 6 years Stop defending these corporations and have some standards for Christ sake
Yes minecraft is a platform not a game just because you think minecraft is just vanilla minecraft does not mean the content isnt there and you can keep downvoting my comments but it wont make you more right and its not what the downvote button is for
That's a disturbing mentality to have that you'd be unironically okay with a corporation pricing out 99 of their consumer base But hey maybe that's a good thing because it would certainly lead to their downfall faster
A 1660 super is a horrible decision right now that 6GB will be a bottleneck even at 1080p Radeon 6600's 8BGB are going for 240 US now Destroys the 1660 3050 The low end belongs to AMD for the time being
No not really To avoid bickering read what guy knowing a bit more says about current state or as I think simply gpus for pc are overvalued as they were not priced for gaming but mining Next stop drop of pc gpu prices will be massive as no more mining Let s wait for amd on November 3rd maybe they are less delusional than Nvidia
Yeah The only way if I can justified it would be for my work and I certainly dont pick up enough side gigs to say that's great value for me
I can't give you staitstics as I don't have the proper numbers thats why I told you just a few you are right it's just a lazy statement I'll try to explain myself in a different way I've been working six years programming met hundred of colleagues and I've only met one fella with a wage 45 000 before taxes I've made quite a lof of friends through the years or people that I have certain trust with and and they have seen exactly the same Maybe I misslead you because I've probably explained it so wrong We are talking about month wage but here in Spain most of us get 14 pays Most of programmers in Spain get 1600 2200 x14 About 28 000 40 000 a year before taxes If you want a better wage than 45 000 before taxes here in Spain is very VERY difficult You won't get it programming you'll have to go the manager way
Yes just not a modern one A 2080 Ti is an older High End card that nowadays performs like a 3070 but going by your rule x70 cards are high end The new midrange cards are obviously not as well equipped to handle big resolutions than the previous high end cards which gives the older cards an edge there And thats the difference between a midrange card and a last gen high end card You can bet a 6900XT will be faster than a 4070 and or as fast as the 4080 12GB high end card despite being midrange going by your logic In fact a 3090 etc still falls into the current high end segment even going by your logic simply by pure high end and a 3090 will be faster than that thing EDIT The 11GB 1080 Ti can do things a comparable midrange card cant do due to the amount of VRAM it its now potato tier That said 1080 Ti aged like fine wine Also some cards age worse than one of them had 8GB VRAM both had equal performance the 970 aged worse The 970 could not run Mirrors Edge Catalyst at highes texture settings it got like 15 fps while the 390 was fine with it A few years from now the 16GB vram on my 6900XT will be the difference between a midrange card and a old high end card I can enable settings that a 5050 or so wont be able to or whatever that will be then even if both have the same amount of compute It is not as simple as you try to make it
Who is AMD leveraging Nvidia prices are completely out of control since 1000 series Nvidia probably doesn't even consider AMD as a competitor Amd could get higher margins on bigger GPUs now that they have mcm they have perfect opportunity to go above Nvidia because mcm scales better than monolithic die will AMD take opportunity Obviously not lets wait until Nvidia gets mcm Only this AMD cares is how they will fit themselves next to Nvidia so they can profit nothing more because anything more is simply risk even tho gamers proved time and time again that they are ready to spend anything on GPUs All I want is best GPU that money can buy that is best for their company AMD or Nvidia AMD just makes sure I will never pick them honestly am fine with that AMD leveraging Nvidia rolling on the floor laughing I presume this is why Nvidia is now charging us 900 for 4070 right Because AMD is leveraging Nvidia prices give me a break the only thing AMD is leveraging is themselves to higher tier
Oh I agree
True although gamers are probably the largest
That's true but most people don't do that Is that true The gtx 1060 came out 6 years ago and it's still the most popular card Enthusiasts I e People on this sub might change gpu every couple years but that's not the case for the general population Consoles also provide a more satisfactory gaming experience over that period That's debatable
I'm aware of its impact which is why I said it depends how you measure it I didn't say it was no big deal You say simply inflation I say rampant destruction of wealth and wages across the board This is a very big deal too
Yeah I'm not planning to move up from 1440p until about 2024 so 40 series isn't really worth it for me The 3080 will keep me happy
Yeah that's you Goodbye
I mean the steam stats give way too big a percentage to be just outliers People be spending that pandemic
Performance per dollar of ddr has decreased at release of every new version SSD prices were increasing for some time too There is nothing novel here
They have progressed but they are literally the only tech market in the world where the perf stagnated in the last 6 years What data leads you to the conclusion that gpu performance per dollar has stagnated in the last 6 years
Ok that s fine point is there are options for people on a budget
I have a PC with a 10700K and 3080Ti and I have a PS5 If I had to choose one I d choose my PC PS5 is still cool though
I m not the one who said my employees can t afford 1 000 for a phone every few years
Maybe you didn't work with the right people I can't say for all balkan countries but in Romania there are at least 10 companies who pay the salaries I told you without breaking a sweat for a regular senior developer no tech lead management positions and I'm not even accounting for ones like Microsoft where interviews are hard to pass statistically
Fine have fun with your high end gtx 690 And I'll get myself a low end 4050 or something
Who is AMD leveraging No one You're the one hoping to use cheaper Radeon prices as leverage against geforce prices AMD doesn't 're making money hand over fist with Genoa Bergamo and Ryzen They're even making money in HPC supercomputing Amd could get higher margins on bigger GPUs now that they have mcm they have perfect opportunity to go above Nvidia because mcm scales better than monolithic die This is wrong MCM scales performance not performance watt Monolithic dies are more efficient Considering Nvidia is hitting power limits already this is only an advantage if they target optimal Voltage frequency ratios in their clocks like apple did with the M1 All I want is best GPU that money can buy that is best for their company AMD or Nvidia I'd believe this if so many didn't keep shifting their interpretation of the term best GPU I believe you want the best Nvidia GPUs your money can buy You just hope AMD offerings would put that closer to the flagship tier AMD just makes sure I will never pick them honestly am fine with that Pretty sure they're fine with that More wafer capacity for Bergamo chips Because AMD is leveraging Nvidia prices give me a break Please read better PS Punctuations help
I think you are underestimating the revenue from artists they are more willingly to upgrade more often every extra second of render time costs money and they also buy multiple GPUs have a look at some of the render rigs one rig with 10 3090s It's a completely different world
That's true but I think they may be because nothing else has been good in that segment since the 1060 Those gamers have been left high and dry since then It is debatable but for me the only PC thing I'd miss is mods A PS5 is killer value right now especially with GPUs priced as they are Sony exclusives make that more enticing
What in the
Funniest part being PCB shorter on the 4090
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
That literally would not fit in my case
It makes the 3090 look small And the TUF 3090 is definitely not small
now do one comparing it to a 1080TI cries in to my SFF case
Couple more years and GPUs will be integrated into a PC case then you just put and plug all other components into it
When the GPU node gets smaller but the cooler gets bigger
Jesus christ This is like comparing an RTX 3090 Ti to a GTX 960
Wow this is just ridiculous now I thought we were actually going to start seeing some smaller cards after seeing the 30 series FE cards naked And now this comes
So even if I wanted to buy one I wouldn't be able to fit it in my case
When I bought 2070S it looked like a monster compared to 1060 Then 3080TUF made 2070 look like a toy and now this At this point I am not even sure O11D will have enough clearance with the insane height of the card and the need to use the wonky power supply adapter that apparently doesn t bend too much
Why is it so big doesn't it have the same tdp as a 3090ti
Dear G
I upgraded to a used 3090 TUF just the other day I was shocked at how much bigger and heavier it was than my 2080 TI and I had to move hard drives and cabling to make room Even then installation was tricky fit And I have a NZXT H440W which is a pretty big case The apparent relative size of the 4090 TUF 't actually believe it It makes my card look small If you haven't seen a 3090 TUF in person I think it might be hard to grasp just how fuck off huge this is Oh my god
I feel like we should maybe slow down on making things more powerful and maybe start making things more efficient These cards are ever increasing in size and power draw eventually most people won t even be able to use them Perhaps we should try to make them smaller and more efficient so that they can I don t know be usable by most people
3090 is already big WTF
That's not a GPU This is a GPU
Remember when the 3090s were comically large
Runs at a blazing hot 40C in full load
Bye bye mini itx builds
Derbauer compared the 4090FE with the Aorus command those cards are so huge it s comical
Well it only needs two expansion brackets so surely it would fit in an mITX case s
Thats hot
Now pls give the same size cooler to normal cards so i can run them silent Also now imagine that heatsink but with 3x120mm noctua 's gonna be insane
Optimus water cooling already announced a water block for Tuf model Got my eye on theirs
that looks like 3090 vs 3060 wtf lol
Wow everything about this card is god awful
I would like to see their reasoning why you need 4 slot cooler for 450W card when 2 5 was enough for 350W one Hell my Evga 3090 XC3 is 2 2 one and it was OK As i see it its clear attempt at milking the consumers they can now justify selling them for more than they could otherwise even if nobody needs such huge ass heatsink
Goddamm I thought the 3090 was massive jfc
How the fuck can the case hold that thing up
That s a huge bitch
I ve got a Corsair 4000D case Not a massive case by any means but it s definitely not small Very comfortable to build in and my 3090 with an AIO on it has tons of extra room These new Asus cards literally won t even fit in the case Wtf
Nvidia went big mode
Geforce font txt different why
i feel like at this point the motherboard goes onto the 4090 not the other way around insert look at me i am the captain now
Huh Smaller board bigger heatsink Makes me think of the smaller endowed guys driving dodge dually's May or may not apply here I guess
The g in gpu is now giga instead of graphical
PCB of the actcual card is like 10 of that lol water cooling is the way to go
Lol are we going backwards with innovation It should be atleast the same size if not smaller
Wow this is nuts I knew it was large from the dimensions but
This shit needs to stop
RIP My meshify C
WTF
BBC B Big B Black C Chonky Card
I love that the card itself gets smaller but the cooler gets bigger
I'm now a little worried about my case I had to flip the cable bracket in my Lian Li Mesh to get my EVGA 3090 to fit
That's a big mammer jammer
You should see the high end Gigabyte one If you thought the 4090 FE was big that custom one is just comically large
Pcb is alot smaller though so if water cooling that will be tiny
350W card vs 450W card What's the size difference between the 3090 Ti TUF and 4090 TUF
Needs a serious kickstand to prop that up
Does it run Crysis
In awe of the size of this lad Absolute unit
Not so TUF now eh
no fing way i have the tuf 3080 its not small
The new font really does look like shit
Soon the gpu will come with space to add ram a cpu and rgb fans for pizzaz
We've entered realms of pure comical GPU sizes
Good Lord
Going to need a new way of mounting GPUs to the motherboard going forward
4090s is a computer in itself Nvidia has gone mad
I still remember fitting my 3090 into the case it was like trying to move a sofa round a corner this begs belief
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
The price increase for the 4000 series is actually due to the added copper needed to cool it lol
Absolutely
The return of full the full tower is here
Holy fuck This puts the size into perspective OMG
How are these not snapping off PCIe slots
Christ what the hell I thought the 3090 was massive and it s being absolutely dwarfed here
I can't believe it makes the 3090 look
GPU sizes unironically turning into that cat weight chart meme
Trying to fit this in my case would be X rated
The guy she tells you not to worry about
No no no I put a motherboard onto my GPU The mobo is the expansion card
Where Banana Need measuring banana This could be twenty feet long for all we know
TUF as in if you thought this was going to fit in your case TUF shit
The font change is AWFUL
there's no way to fit this in my meshify c heh might need a new case
I can already feel my room heating up
Wtf
Lol absurd face with tears of joy
The first computer was the size of a room The last graphics card will be the size of a room before global extinction lead by ai
You should have a banana for scale
That thing is gonna break my 850W PSU
I am using a Meshify 2 compact PC case as far as I see If I would have the money I wouldn't be able to but the graphics card in it D
I only build SFF but I bought AMD last three times so no skin off my back I have a RX 6750 XT GPU and a AMD 5800X3D Nothing out there I can't run gaming wise
At this point I found a new hobby If its costing the price of a house mortgage Yeah Nvidia keep justifying the 4070 is the 4080 12GB We should get the FTC involved for false advertising I decided to spend money on an EUC instead And later down the road I'll get an AMD GPU Nobody wants a power hungry card the requires a ATX 3 0 power supply Then your connectors have a plug in cycle limit of 30 times Unplugging and replugging the 8pin connectors
90 BETTER PERFORMANCE 3 times the size
The TUF series for 3090 is a joke 2 8pins for a whopping 375w power draw Compare the Strix OC 3090 3x8pin which comes with 480w out of the box mostly shows perf increase in 4k Both cards have good components but the strix 3090 is rated for 1080w
Yo this is not ok
Wonder what's going to run hotter The card when its working properly or the fire from the connectors melting trying to supply this thing power
So they dropped the stupid 12pin plug Never mind I was looking at it backwards zany face
wow that massive eh Massive size massive price tag not even reach 2x of 3090 perf
Bruh i literally just got a 3060 Dont tell me the new 4000 came out already
This 40 series is fucking stupid NO improvments to the chip at all just chuck more power to get more FPS out of it at a time where worldwide energy prices are skyrocketing Then to also find out the 4090 is BIGGER than a whole xbox series S console
The smaller the technology pcb the bigger the cooling It is what it is
Just goes to show how much more hardware you're getting for basically the same amount of money Very excited
When I got my 3080 ti I thought it was ridiculously stupidly big I took pictures comparing it to my old 1660ti and made jokes about it I actually can t imagine how a pc with a card this HUGE will look How big does the case have to be Can the case or mobo even support something this huge
350 vs 450 TDP It ll be interesting to compared 3090ti TUF vs 4090TUF since they are both 450TDP
All spcaps look prettier tho
Whose a big boy Yes you are
Definitely going back in time that 9090Ti is gonna take up the whole room
Which ones the 4090 s
What The Actual Fuck
OK I was on the fence but now I know it ain't happening I have a 3080 but may just get a 3090 if I really want to upgrade
Thicc
And I thought my 3080 Ti was massive dear lord
She's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
Top VHS Player Bottom LaserDisc Player
This hits different because the 3090 TUF is my current card That 4090 is truely massive I thought the 3090 was huge when I first bought it
No thanks I'll keep my current 3090 lol
r sizematters
Isn't the 3090 TUF cooler basically the same as you would get in a 3070
BROOO WTF that is a 3090 Man I thought my 1070Ti Amp Extreme was a big card
Look at me I'm the motherboard now
Yeah I m out Not going any bigger My TUF 3080 is already a chonk and uses a ton of power I don t need an even bigger space heater
The heck i recently replaced my 1070ti by 3080ti and was like omg thats so huge
You vs the guy she told you not to worry about
We re really testing the bounds of GPU sag aren t we They should come with an adjustable leg at this point
Are they the same height though
We re going backwards with technology I thought as technology progresses things got smaller and be as powerful and more efficient than their predecessor
The new font looks really bad
You probably not only have to change your PSU but also your case I dont think mid tower pc can fit 4090
That's fucked up I understand it needs better cooling though so it makes sense
How is that gonna fit in any case That s like me putting a corgi in my case lol
Of course it's twice as powerful it's twice as big
I have a full tower and even I am concerned
We're going to need a bigger boat
Wut
Holy shit that s ridiculous
Thats insane
M I don't know if it'd be strong enough to handle the absurdity of the TUF 4090 But I do at least have the room in my case
Is there some sort of push towards external GPUs What the actual fuck
And this is why I won't be going with Asus again despite really wanting to The card is too damn long for my case I'd have to use a drill to remove the rivets keeping my drive bays in place permanently destroying the case ruining the structural integrity of it and all for what A card that is likely not going to be any significantly better than an FE Pointless
Next the gpu is gonna need a case for itself
My 3080 is actually a little smaller than my 2080 Ti Was noticeable when I put it in the case the first time Wasn't quite as tight of a fit
RIP SFF peeps myself included
Photoshop game is good thumbs up medium light skin tone
Liquid cooling is going to be the way with cards this big for me Some needed a bracket to hold them before what s next
Maybe just start making the graphics card the case and fit the rest of the components inside it
I have a large fractal case and I m 100 sure that wouldn t fit into it What the fuck
i bought a pop air mini for my next build i honestly hope a 4060 can fit in it
Holy shit thats biggest gpu i've ever seen in my lifesweat droplets
And here I was thinking my 3090 was way too big already It looks like babies first GPU compared to the 4090
THICC
By by itx builds I guess
Almost 2 longer than the EVGA 3090 ftw 13 7 in total
I WANT
Honestly which cases do I have to choose from if I m looking to get one of these 4090s Seems like it s VERY limited
Massive bois
Remember when small form towers were the big trend LoL
I'm going for that one for sure Looks like a cool card
if only these cards could produce cold air as well we couls have an a c and a heater all in one
YUUUGE
The 3090 TUF still feels kind of normal sized I got one Big but not quite Strix preposterous This though 40 series is insane And I'm not talking about performance
Bruh
it is the same dimensions as the 3090 founders edition
The size and price just keep increasing
Would this even fit in a Phanteks P300A
Can we get a 20 series in there too
I was originally going to go for a 4090 FE at launch but I think I'm going to hold off until waterblocks are released for multiple skus Sure EK is releasing theirs in November but as someone who has made the switch the SFF and watercooling I literally wouldn't be able to fit an aircooled card in my case I'll be risking supply issues but it's not like my 3080 Ti is struggling to play games in the meantime
Won't be surprised if the Asus x Noctua is bigger and has 140 mm fans
So R9 295x2 was not a bad idea
At a certain point if these things aren't scaled down they should just be sold as external devices with their own power supply Yea that might add to the cost but they are already the cost of a computer by themselves
Whoaaaaaaaa
The new font is bothering me more than the size
I feel like we re heading for a day where gpu s will take up the whole bloody case lol
Hope the 4xxx doesn't have the capacitor issues the 3xxxx series had
What Its just an ordinary GP OH MY GOODNESS JENSON
Rip I'm gonna have to buy a new case Could you get some depth measurements comparisons if you get the chance that would be great no worries if not
This looks like a joke One of those size illusions right Someone please confirm the whole 40 series is actually an in joke or off time April fools prank
Do i need a separate case for it jeez
That's no moon
The corsair 1000D finally has a reason to exist
Man even had to say oh my gawd out loud just to emphasize to myself how big it is
Lot of people going to need bigger cases
What the actual fuck I've seen a 3080 TUF in person same design as 3090 TUF and that card is already enourmous And now this 4090 is significantly bigger than that Such a stupid trend to make it all bigger and hotter Suddenly all your cases are too small power supplies too weak room too hot and PCIe slots on your motherboard bent
Well it turns out my thermaltake level 20 xt has finally a worthy opponent
I thought my card is chunky but damn boi 4090 is thick boi card
I don't like the new font
Holy shit I might have to check if my case is big
So its titse times as big as a joke
I'm curious if the power consumption on the new AMD chiplet GPUs The chiplet design should allow for clocks better in the efficiency range without harming performance as much as a monolithic design
I mean I'm not going to pay their extortionate prices anyway but even if I was I'm pretty sure this wouldn't fit in my O11D due to the height
I ve never been so disinterested in a product launch It s way too big Price is too much also Meh I ll wait till 5000 series to upgrade 1080Ti still doing the business
When Moore s Law slows down you just gotta add more chip area to keep gaining performance
I'd rather compare my electricity bill
Just make a SOE and be done with it
I want someone to cut off the over hanging heat sink and see how it performs Just to make sure they didn t make it that big to make us have to buy bigger cases
new font looks like shit imo
At what point do we stop calling it a card and start calling it a box or crate
We need a banana for scale sir not half your hand
Time to buy an old van to use it as my new PC case
Does anyone have actual measurements for these
I think we aren't too far off when GPUs will end up as the size of a Motherboard
50 series cards are gonna need their own separate cases at this rate
chonk
At this rate I might as well get the 3080 or 4060 Ti
RTX 4XXX are all begging for a custom loop Think its time to upgrade from the 2080ti down the road Not at these current MSRP's
They might as well just make one slot motherboards now
N listen to me when I say the 3090 is fucking huge already
That s freaking ridiculous so you basically need a super sized case just to squeeze that sucker in there I mean at what point is Nvidia just going to make a damn Console of their own and Collett a day
This is already what my 3080 Ti looks like next to my old 1080 Ti
Really looks like this is a gpu generation to skip They just cranked up the power on last gen architecture threw on a huge cooler and tossed it out the door
Looks like father and son
Honestly officer I'm not growing pot I'm just playing Crysis on my 4090 me probably
When I get my 4090 I'm having a decal made with the old logo font
This is just the Tuf version can't wait to see the Strix
got it ordering 2 fractal torrents one compact torrent for everything but the 4090 and one regular torrent for the 4090
Here I am buying a toy to hold up my 3080 and the 40 series needs a brick to keep it from sagging
Well good think I m gonna build it with a Corsair 7000D
Please someone put this on a mini itx board
you vs etc
DAMN BOY
Here let me just move home for this
the 5090 in a mini itx mobo
Sooo external GPUs are coming next right
Incredible
hopefully it wont get any bigger in 2years with the high end rtx5000 series as this is where i plan to upgrade i don't expect them to go past what we already see here that's said my case silent base 802 shouldnt have any issues
Holy fuck that is out of hand
This is making my tuf 3080 feel insecure
Seems like all the 4090s have the same design Boxy and similar dimensions Is this what EVGA meant by NVIDIA limiting creativity
So small form factor PCs are actually dead with the 4000 series A very sad day indeed
3090 Pro vs 4090 pro max I wonder what 1080ti mini will say about this
yeah we're never getting rid of global warming
I have an all amd system and I m never going back
some more comparisons
And here I thought that the 3000 series cards were already too big Then all of a sudden BAM 4000 series ABSOLUTE CHONK
Why am i getting a knockoff vibe from that new font
If it hasn't already been done here then We're gonna need a bigger boat P
At this point full atx towers are the future and only options
AMD 7000 series and Nvidia 4090 s are about to show the world what true global warming is
Having Deja vu moment here of when the Voodoo 5 6000 prototypes first started circulating around the internet
I had issues fitting my FTW3 80 ti in my O11XL prior to adding a water block to it I can only imagine my tube layout if I had this chungus of a card in there For context I mounted my pump on the right fan on the bottom radiator and had only a single mm of clearance to fit the card with the stock cooler
Gonna be a TUF fit in some cases I ll show myself out
No one mentioning the new power connector on the 4090 though
This is fucking stupid Cards should be getting smaller not doubling size
I want to see this compared to like a 3060 universally known as the most bang for your buck card The 4090 would not be able to fix in ANYTHING It makes the 3090 look small
We're gonna need a bigger case
The 4090 is not the issue is the 4080 12g aka 4060 v 3080
Okay this one actually is too big for my case like wth rolling on the floor laughing
Soon they have to attach those with car radiator
I was barely able to fit my 3080 TUF in the NCASE M1 same size as this 3090 the 4090 without question will require a new case
No Smaller die size half of previous 8nm samsungs and it still runs this hot Dafuq
why is the bracket still only 2 slots
Next generation 5xxx Series Graphics cards would probably would cost around 3 500 and a cigarette
Bloody hell
Lol what the fuck
I think the 3000 series TUF cards were a bit undersized I have a 3080 Ti TUF and I picked up a 6700 XT TUF and it make the 3080 Ti look a bit small It's noticeably bigger in every dimension Still that 4090 is massive I'll be interested to see what the temps are
Banana hand for size
Big brother and little brother grinning squinting face
Holy going off the Asus website the 4090 TUF is 348mm long and 160mm
My reference 3090 is about a quarter of an inch away from the fans in the front of my case This is ridiculous
I have a feeling my power gas bill will thank me for not buying any of these My skin durring the summer will also appreciate my decision as my 3080ti alone makes my space hotter than satan's spoog
I have a question if the TDP for RTX 4080 16GB is 320 watts which is actually lower than the TDP for RTX3080 Ti at 350 watts why did all these manufacturers make the new cards so much bigger than the previous generation of cards at the cost of lower compatibility when the new cards should run cooler at the same performance
downgrade on the capacitors
And I thought my 3080TI was
woah my 3080 tuf is like baby kitten compared to it
Suddenly overwhelmingly glad I just moved out of my H510i into an o11 dynamic
Wow forgot how good the 3000 series TUF coolers were It seems it can cool a 3070 Ti or lower I m not sure and a 3090 well enough while also being kind of compact to put it on both
The dimension of the 4090 TUF is 348 2 160 72 6mm or 34 82 16 7 26cm Asus Website We find the volume taking in consideration it is a cuboid So the total volume comes out to be 4 044 6912cm 3 Now we convert it into liters it by 1000 it comes out to be 4 0446912 liters 4 liters So the question is can we build a SFF PC inside the RTX 4090 TUF
Ok but a 3090 that almost looks like a normal sized GPU is actually impressive I hope the 4090 flunks because of how big and expensive the cards are I think it's time to admit 4 slot GPUs are enough Like ofc you can stick a metal slab onto a chip to improve it's cooling so why not do that with some super rtx 9090 and then never have to make another giant GPU again for the next 10 years
I have the TUF 's already not small and the TUF 4090 makes it look like a midget Mother of god
And here we thought 3090 WAS big lmao
In 10 years the GPU will be the case
at what point will the graphics card itself run your entire computer
To me bigger is better Including cock n balls No homo maybe
What are ridiculous size
That's not progress
I hope these things come with card sag brackets
I ll have to get a bigger case for these damn cards
New Age Space Heater
Hey Mom I need a bigger case
Funny thing though is that the 40 series is gunna use less power than the 30 series My best friend has a buddy from high school who works at NVIDIA That's how I know this
Have you seen the pic of the itx mobo plugged into it
You don t have to worry about gpu sag if the gpu is already touching the bottom of the case
OK Im switching my reason from can't afford to can't fit in my case as excuse to not buying it
Someday we will have a desk sized graphics card connected to a tiny smartphone
Holy mother of god that's ridiculous
In awe at the size of this lad Absolute unit
At some points we'll be back to having computers as large as houses
That is insane when i took out my strix 1070ti for a strix 3080ti i was blown away at the size difference but that 4090 is next level wholey shit
I have a tuf 3080 and I already thing that thing is massive lol
That card is literally 5cm longer and more than 4cm wider than the 3090 My 3080 zotac amp holo is 3cm smaller than this I think it could fit in my case 4000D airflow but it probably would sit right next to my intake fans Like exactly next to them My central case fan would become an external gpu cooling fan
Is this for real By 2030 I will need a separate tower case and PSU just for the GPU
Oh yeah Been waiting all year for dem asus sandles
Need banana for scale
I want to see someone MacGyver one of these to bolt on the front or top of a case with a riser acting as an exhaust
Inb4 nvidia launches rtx 5090 fe with a waterblock Not even an aio Just the waterblock so you have to custom loop it
A step forward in performance 5 steps backward in font choice
What a generic font in the new one
This looks like my 3080 vs my old 1070 insane
What the I though 3090 was big enough
Is there a way to turn off the RGB on the TUF models in general Other than opening it up and disconnecting the cable
So is this goodbye to high end sffc builds
nVidia is definitely taking the piss at this
He thicc boyyyy
The thing is just one huge heatsink It seems like instead of using new technology or optimization they just made the new series draw more power and heat up more to deliver the performance boost Honestly kind of a joke This generation of GPUs has less effort put in making them and the asking price is higher I hope they take development more seriously for the next generation
Let s see a noctua 3070 up there too
its ok the universe is expanding
At this rate one day I ll have to buy a case just to house my graphics card
I was so ready to call bullshit on this I was convinced that was a 3080 or a 3070 or something but the nvlink connector gives it away Dear God
Come on now this isnt really a size comparison without a banana
Woah wants it
Pretty sure my 3070 ti is bigger than that 3090
Mother of God
I currently have a 3090 and planned to get a 4090 I'm starting to have real concerns about size
Do you need someone to take that 3090 off your hands Il take a donation
Wait 4090 is out
That cannot be real i have the 3080 tuf and it is allready fucking massive Do they want everyone to get some server rig or some shit to fit in their builds
we have GT210 in some office PCs It would be funny side by side
Mom can we please get the 1599 room heater I can even play games on it
Perfect for ripping the PCB slot off of your motherboard
Upgrading to a 3080 is getting more appealing
That font change is pus wtf were you thinking nvidia
Will it fit in a NR200 with the front cover off
Am I the only one or it seems like the gpus are starting to transform into combustion engines
Gonna need a whole server room if this keeps up
no words waiting for the 5090 lemme see how ps4 to ps4 pro would that be
It's just bigass cooler and same size pcb omg
I mean if you're spending 1600 USD for a GPU you can certainly buy a waterblock for it to put in your custom cooling loop
The BFGPU just got BFGPUer
i'd be afraid this card could tear the pcie slot from its motherboard over time when mounted vertically
Now do 3090Ti vs 4090
Forget sffpc will that even fit in an atx case
That's as big as the box my 1080TI came in
The TUF 30 series cards are chunky boys too like god damn
I think we're crossing a line from hah my GPU is massive to can this even fit in most cases
Yup a two slot bracket should be fine for this
Is it 3 times the frames but
600w and smaller power connector That's just stupid I'm sorry but its true Idk what they trying to achieve but especially on high end 40series over 400w it will cause issues
I THATS A THICK ASS BOY
That s definitely a crappy cooler on the 3090 iv seen 3070 80 S with better coolers
WTF card user dont matter here just money marketing
This is unbelievable what the heck None sense Some of this cards are bigger than a xbox Nvidia should think how to better without going gigantic Probably The 5090 is going to be bigger than my entire case
Are there even any cases that fit this beast
192 bit bus ahahah
I know it's not going to happen but people need to vote with their wallets and send a clear message to Nvidia and possibly AMD depending on RX7000 details that bigger and more power hungry is not the direction we want to continue heading as PC gamers Pricing be damned these cards are flat out ridiculous
The fact that the 4090 has a 2 slot bracket is a joke
I am the o my one who is more concerned with the width of this cards than the length In most large mid towers the length is going to fit The width tho Not the heigh the width My mid tower is pretty spacious for a mid tower And my tuf rtx 3080ti once the power cables are conected the cables are like 0 2 cm away from the tempered crystal panel this cards are like 2 to 3 whole cm wider than my 3080 tuf If it was the card alone it would fit but the power cables won t I really wouldn t like ti have ti go for an always opened build
Am i the only one who doesnt mind the size wish we had these sizes on the 3xxx series and AMD cards its just better cooling Now im waiting on 5 slot cards with a tube fan design one fan at the back and one fan at the front to just tunnel the air through i dont use the rest of my pcie slots anyway
GPU support brackets are hitting gym now in preparation
Guess asus decided the MLCC Poscap debate is over and swapped out the full array of MLCC s behind the gpu this gen
You and the guy she said to not worry about
I don t mind the size of it That teensy little plug though Why did they miniaturize that damn power socket I mean the card needs 450W
Boy that s TUF
I don't understand why they don't just add a third bracket for support instead of sticking with the two bracket
This is actually a joke now
D 't wait for the 4090 Would definitely be an issue in my Hyte Y60
Awesome bro Nvidia solved winter heating problem No need that stupid ass Russian gas no more Slava Ukraniclapping handsthumbs upyellow heartblue heartUkraineUkraine
People are worried that the gpu is too long I m worried if it s too wide Like look at how much extra width is past the case slot
Size isn't everything you know A lot of people would be perfectly happy with the 3090 In fact research shows that most boxes don't have the depth to even fit the bigger one
Interesting that the 3090 PCB is larger than the 4090s 4090 size is all cooler
Hey it runs sub 60C
Face it Cooling performance is related to the surface area
I googled the dimensions and the 4090 TUF is around the same size as the 3090 Suprim X The 3090 TUF is relatively small for a 3090
This is the way
Perfect for water cooling
good catch on that honestly that just means water cooled 4090's will be smaller than 3090s watercooled or air cooled right
But the pcb is fatter So the area evens out
Where in Michigan you from
Holy shit just noticed
True but replace the 3090 with a 750 ti
That is literally longer than my case
Same I don t think can t even vertically mount that
I'm not sure it would fit any very many cases with SATA bays
I don t think it d fit in 75 of cases This is a really really weird moment My first thought was this product is 100 not meant for the consumer market
That will likely fit in my P600s case but it's going to make it look like it's MATX at first glance
Good you don't need a 4090
I have a sleeper machine built in an old MATX case with 4 PCI IO slots That card could fit but I wouldn't risk it
I cut my case to fit a 3080ti
This is already became an issue with my case The biggest card I could purchase was Rtx 3060ti and when I say fit I mean really tight I measured twice and it actually was a little bit too big had to redo cable management just to move few cables 4090 is just not an option It has almost no right to exist in the first place I am kind of shock this is still in a consumer gaming tier card
1 2 of the 3k gen doesn't fit in both of the last 2 cases I had Who the fuck are these 4k cards for
I read that new motherboard versions will have a PCIe slot that is diagonal to let you install in old pc cases
I wouldn't be able to SLI lol
I have the fractal design meshify c and the max length for gpu with the front case fan is 315mm Not alot of options there
Wall mount it Now the house is your PC case
The 5090 won't fit into most apartments
That literally takes up more volume than my case
My 3070ti has the exact same heatsink as the 3090 and that already barely fits and has a serious sag
Back when they marketed it as the B FGPU
I remember thinking the 3090s were massive I almost can t fathom how big that will be in hand
The TUF 3090 is much smaller than the STRIX 3090 It is a bit smaller than the STRIX 2080 TI
Yeah Hmm Is the TUF larger than FE Do we know I have a 3090 and do have some room in my case but this looks a bit big lol I guess cases are cheap compared to 4090 cards
can confirm the 3099 tuf is not small I have one here I've been abusing but that's just nuts man
I was surprised to see that my EVGA 1080 was almost as big as my Asus 3080
The 1089ti is definitely still a relevant card today
The case IS the heatsink
PC will be integrated in the gpurolling on the floor laughing
You mean a gaming console
Seems logical at this point but nope they want to keep milking the PC elitists
Did you get the GPU with or without the integrated CPU
With Nvidia in the game maybe we could see a CPU GPU combo
Actually if you look carefully the 4090 PCB is smaller it ends where the plug for power comes in I have a evga hybrid 3090 and its just a two slot card the cooler stops right at the end of the pcb From what I've seen the MSI 4090 hybrid is pretty small too
Surprisingly according to Ali from Optimum Tech the 4090 FE fits in a FormD T1
AIB should include free case with a purchase of this beast
I don't know for sure but I think the 3090 Ti power adapter only had 3 cables while this one has 4 The card can draw up to 600w or more It's kind of ridiculous I guess they want to make sure it stays perfectly cool without being a vacuum cleaner in your PC
Because we can get 3GHz at around 50 60C this time thank to bigger coolers
They overbuilt the coolers to take 600 watts easy it looks like
It might not
If chips become more efficient that just means they can push them harder to get even more performance
I mean yes but also you re looking at the enthusiast top of the line here It s like complaining a Lamborghini gets poor gas mileage and is too low to the ground to have an optimal experience at a McDonalds drive through window The purpose of these cards is uncompromising performance first everything else second
They already are being made much more efficient Efficiency and high power draw are not exclusive
Vote with your wallet and buy the lower power option
4090 1 5x 3090ti at the same 450w how it is not more efficient you also don't have to buy the top end cards
They are more effecient As such so too will the smaller lower end skus This card isnt meant for you
They are more efficient Why do people think otherwise Seeing the same comments on Ryzen 7000 You can undervolt or lower the power draw Or not buy a xx90 card in the first place BTW they removed SLI so compared to high end systems in the past this is much more reasonable
start making things more efficient They are provided their claims are at least somewhat true the 4080 12 gb is a 285w card with better performance than a 3090ti
Nvidia should hire you for such insightful comment
It always amazes me that people don t understand that more powerful more efficient It is more efficient That s how it is more powerful It just has more head room
If they had opted for sensible power requirements and efficiency it would be slower using the same die and they wouldn't be able to justify charging such a stupid price for it Most people don't want this product It's a 1600 graphics card Hardly anyone will buy it There will be more sensible efficient options that are equally overpriced for what they are
Tbf Nvidia's endgame is to only sell physical hardware to Enterprise and Enthusiasts willing to pay exorbitant prices Instead you will be leasing compute processing power from them in a tiered XaaS model to play your games as a regular consumer
Well if you look at what AMD offers it's miles more efficient The 3090 vs the Rx 6900 XT the 6900xt beats it in pure rasterization with about 200 watts less
that's literally what this is though this is just the first time they've been able to squeeze something this powerful into a PC barely If benchmarks are accurate the 4090 could provide 80 more rasterization than the 3090 but it's thermal design power has increased by less than 30 This is repeated throughout the product range If you want your electricity consumption to decrease you can simply opt for a less powerful model like the 4080's
ITX would look like a wittle daughterboard on this monstrosity
I was just thinking this I ve got a GTX 1080 with a full custom loop crammed into an Ncase M1 I love the little build but there s like 0 5 cm of space in between things and I had to go external for a reservoir There s no way this card would fit And with the length I m not even sure I d be able to make it fit with a full water cooled build
There will likely be 600W bioses available
We had a solution for this back in the day full length expansion cards Cards were all standardized to 312mm 12 28 inches in length Cards shorter than this would often have additional blank PCB with break away tabs to meet the full length requirement This standardization allowed case manufacturers to fit brackets into the front of their cases that seated the far end of each expansion card You can see these expansion card brackets in a number of older PC cases
TUF is 348mm 4000D can take a 360mm GPU
do phones not get bigger each generation even though they have more innovation in them
I think at 720p and medium settings
Maybe go back to the good ol' desktop cases
Just remove the stupid powerlimits and that TUF can handle 600W just fine I do agree that it's pretty stupid out of the box tho
NO improvments to the chip at all What are you talking about they went from 8nm to 5nm and the TDP is the same as the 3090ti at 450W with at least a 50 performance boost
replace hardware with cooling and your sentence becomes correct the PCB ends earlier than the 3090 so it's more dense but that just gives more cooling and that's it
Corsair 5000D or 7000D
Founders is 1000 more but a lot of the AIB are actually the same this time around for the 90 series
Don t need to go that crazy 5000D will fit all of these with ease for 1 3 the cost
4090 Founders 4090 WindForce 3x base version 4090 Gaming X Trio 4090 SuprimX AIO 4090 PNY These are your only choice for stock cooling in the NR200P I think
I love it I get anxious seeing GPU temps over 70C
It doesn't really feel like improvement when it's 60 faster but also 65 bigger lol
It better with that hockey rink cooler
But now my room is 60C
At idle
Does it really
So does my gaming x trio 3080 granted that's with the fans running at 45 in a Fractal Design Torrent lol
At full load i seriously doubt it Wait till these are in the wild before making that claim
So does my body temperature now thanks nvidia
But how does it fare in an h510 smirking face
Sub 40C
Best thing about the TUF
Ring a ding ding baby
The sad thing is that no matter what the size it's still going to dump 500 watts of heat into your room
Premium cooling solution on a premium card just to fit it into a regular ATX case
I've got a custom loop and I'm glad for this cause I can't move the pump and if the PCB was as long as the cooler it would not fit the case
Are there any preblocked cards out on the 12th
Founders edition 30 series have really short pcbs
PCB looks to be the same thickness
Well not exactly Given it pumps out so much heat you need larger heatsinks to keep the cards cool
Laughs in open airflow case
Longer and wider than my S4M That's wild
Same I'm planning to cut into the front frame of the case
But you can vertically mount your house on it Think outside the box
That s what she said dang I tried to resist Sorry guys carry on
I have a Cooler Master HAF X which is like legendarily huge It only supports GPUs up to 340mm long These Asus 4090s would require me to gut the drive bays to make room for them I'm trying to imagine smaller cases facilitating these things and it just doesn't make sense to me
That s what I m feeling like too I don t really know who these cards are being made for but at this point I don t think it s gamers
I don't get how these are so huge yet the quadro ones are dual slot blower cards The difference can't be G6x vs G6 surely
Very glad I got the p600s it's a beauty of a good airflow somehow and spacious
I don t need it but I want it
It's a bit too early for 9000 though
BFG isn't making cards anymore
For some reason 10 series cards had really big heatsinks despite drawling not that much power By the time we got to the 30 series it was actually needed and now it looks like we have to go even bigger
Dang wish I knew about the 1089ti before today
The radiator is the case
Hmmmmmm I smell an LTT
That sounds like something Zalman would have tried in 2003
I m ok with a full case cooling solution And honestly if the gpu was the motherboard that would be cool too Let s just go single card
There are some passive cooling cases that do this
Gaming console GPUs aren't integrated into the cases
Well at least there's some hope for people who don't want a gigantic card
Water cooling will become a must now No one has a shelf big enough to house a case big enough Lol
I don't know the exact length of my case but I can see that there is only 3cm space between my 3080 and fans on the front
Well it s the same exact size as the 3090 Ti FE so
600W Oh lordt
Damn dude 150tb What's your situation o
I feel inadequate
That s the problem They make them more efficient so they can push them harder and not make the cards smaller
That is a brilliant analogy clapping hands OK hand
and also just because the Lamborghini exists doesn't mean you can't buy a Toyota they still sell those too
Also who would buy a 1500 upgrade to save 8 on their electric bill with no performance improvement
These guys will be thrown right into a VFX studio s render farm not into John Smith s PC
Yeah albeit they still power limit the 90 series cards by roughly 50 mainly as a means to create artificial product segmentation there's not actually that much difference between a 3080 12GB and a 3090 ti when not VRAM limited if you remove the power limits and cool the chips well but also because even at 50 PL these chips are hard to cool without a custom loop If they're going to PL stuff by 50 for such reasons then they might as well power limit the entire range by 60 and put you in the sweet zone for p2p at least although dual BIOS cards with lower PL quiet BIOS' are doing the Lord's work here lol
Well tbf the 40 series cards didn t improve efficiency much at all instead just turned the power up to 11 to appear better than the 30 series That would be more akin to adding more cylinders and getting worse gas mileage instead of say adding a turbo and keeping smaller displacement
This analogy is really bad particularly in light of the 20 and 30 series It is much more like you buy a lambo one year and it's pretty huge but within reason and next year the comparable model is the size of a small house
That's also the guy that wonders why his macbook air won't play
True But if I m not mistaken a 4060 isn t any smaller right
But in this analogy the Lamborghini has the same engine as the Corolla just with a few more cylinders and a lot more power The efficiency is the same which is the problem
If they re working on making them better than that s great to hear I sort of was under the assumption that they were going to have a 2005 Microsoft moment and just say alright it works send it out Nothing else is necessary
It's hard to vote with your wallet when everything they make is pushed far past their window of efficiency or super low end
Vote with your wallet I like that
Obligatory wait for benchmarks lol This will most likely be 1 5x under very specific conditions workloads same as nearly every other gen
The 4090 is 600W
Sure it s slightly more efficient power wise and that is good but it s still huge Edit I m very wrong here lmao
Because usually more power more energy used and people have learned that these GPUs are supposed to suck down power However this is loosely based on old evidence from like a month ago so it s wrong
If they are then that s great I had heard that the 4090 was gonna pull like 700 watts or something ridiculous but that was a little bit ago so I could be completely incorrect
Um no In Nvidias own charts the 40 80 12 GB performs about the same or slightly lower than a 3090ti in rasta It's also vastly overpriced
Hey guys the new cards are great and all but um they are a little big and draw a lot of power maybe we should take some time to make them smaller and lighter and more efficient Fired on the spot
It always amazes me that people don t realize that DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID THE SAME FUCKING THING NOW GO BE A DICK SOMEWHERE ELSE
But wouldn t it be nice if it y know wasn t nearly the size of a PS5 Efficiency isn t just about power draw if it s more efficient they would be able to make the cards smaller I don t think even the top of the line enthusiasts are very stoked about the sheer size of the cards and I m pretty sure even they wouldn t want to have to transfer their entire PC into a new case just to fit it The card is more efficient power performance wise but at the expense of being a behemoth of a GPU just to cool the thing
I was thinking of referring to the Strix card
Does that include front fans Because if it doesn't then it wont fit
That's a great point I view gpu as a part of a PC The case carrying this gpu is the same size whereas the gpu got bigger
Nvidia bad upvotes to the left
That's good that they kept the price of the 90 series the same I still think they're too much but it's something
I think I'll need to update my PSU to 1000 1200W The perc of a share house with bills included is finally starting to surface
Fun and giggles but wait till you meet angry hockey team when the ice melts
These cards are designed for that so your room should be designed for that too
Well you live in 4090 now
Sounds like a bottleneck to me Better get onto improving your room peripherals
It actually does but with dlss 3 0 and a mega cooler lol
Recently moved my rig into a torrent and my card dropped 10 degrees wasn t expecting it
Could be according to this article they planned the cooling solutions to handle 600W as that was the initial target power consumption Then it got reduced to 450W so there should be plenty of headroom I also expect future 4090s to be smaller
I believe it based on previous gen target specs and the resulting size of them
I m sure just fine Though my thermals are still worse than a friends very similar Corsair 4000d build I also assembled
And even worse This is all either company seems to have See how high we can watt the chip smaller process bigger watts even bigger heatsynch Rinse repeat beat the fuck out of it for decades like like Ike turners dead horse Where does it end Our kids are gonna need forklifts for this shit Have you guys seen a ps5 omg people complained about og Xbox ps5 prolly weighs 4x og xbox
That's why this generation's cooler on the GPU is sized like that for 500 watts at a specific range
Also so we can overclock it and trip the breakers
Yep check out the Inno3D iChill RTX 4090 FROSTBITE It's basically just a 4090 with an Alphacool waterblock pre installed
Doubt it Took forever to see them on the 3090s But who knows
The 40 FE are listed as smaller as the 30 one somehow too
Look at the top view Its looks to be about 2cm wider
Tis motherboard box can t handle it no more We need to place our open bench systems on the gpu box now
laughs in full size tower I've never understood the SFF craze If there was something bigger than a full tower I'd own it
Always wanted heated
Think outside the box Literally
I have that case Would this card seriously not fit This is absurd That case is huge
I have an old Cooler Master Haf x 922 And i'm guessing my case supports either up to 350 mm or 340 mm gpus What is your case model How do you plan on gutting the drive bays Drive bays are metal It needs to be cut We can't do it at home Where will you take your case for this operation if you will Do you have Haf X 930
Does this mean everyone who wants a 4090 from an AIB needs a corsair 1000D
And I thought my HAF XB EVO would last me a while
I just got the HAF 700 non evo it is bigger than I thought Moving things slowly over from my meshify build
Part of me thinks the initial design was drawn up during the mining rush and now we re left with the results of their planning
They're made for the same target audience as the 3090 AI researchers and content creators
I am purely guessing here but the assumption is they don't need as extreme cooling solutions as it's assumed the room is significantly more cooled and thus the heat transfer is way more efficient Like server rooms easily have significant amounts of power spent in HVAC so it's kind of like the entire room is a big very air cooled case
v Zi9ivZL7vmA v Zi9ivZL7vmA Still want it now
I think the reason was to give consumers a bit headroom for overclocking because they knew that most of those Pascal GPU's could achieve at least 120 MHz on chip and 400 MHz on memory
I have two 1669tis in sli
I want it
It's already been done lol There are specialty cases made to get as much passive cooling as possible Those would need to be converted to active cooling but the foundation is there
Yeah technically they are Everything is integrated into a uniform unit
Yeah I am definitely getting a 4090 to replace the 3090 but I won't buy a non hybrid card I know I could go the custom loop route but even if the hybrid is 200 more than a FE the custom loop would still be way more than that I also already have a kraken x73 for the cpu so I'm happy with the temps on that
Well the feeling in the water cooling world in the last year has been to go bigger lol So you see a lot of people going to Mora360 radiators and external pumps lol
Is it an FE The 4090 FE is only 1 9cm longer than the 3080 FE
I shoot 2 and 4k raw
Yes this is the actual problem no smaller cheaper skus a la 1030 etc
What are you implying That we should leave performance on the table just so some whiners can have smaller cards Yea I think I'll go for the performance gains I don't care if it chugs 1000W If it's 70 faster than last gen I'm getting it
An analogy would be Lamborghini making every next car larger heavier hotter and burning more fuel per mile
Why would you argue someone else s flawed analogy with one of your own A car compared to even the tiniest house is like 10x the volume at least
Except you aren t driving a graphics card it just sits in your case so it doesn t actually matter if it s really big as long as it fits
Except they're more efficient than the 20 and 30 series Why are all these kids suddenly computer engineering experts
A 3060 is significantly smaller than a 3090 I d venture a guess that a 4060 will be significantly smaller than a 4090
4060 isn't even released yet lol
4060s have not been announced so we cannot make that comparison
The efficiency isn t the same though At the same power draw Lovelace is more efficient than Ampere Nvidia decided to blow way past what s reasonable in terms of default power draw for the sake of marketing
Wait seriously
have you considered another company AMD or Intel by chance
Because you have no money lol
50 improvement is not slight in the least
Thats just what happens when your dealing with absolute rumors and clickbait It may or may not represent reality at all In this case it was based upon the total power draw of the new connector but that was it Doesnt quite get you to click tho does it you need to speculate that the next gen of GPUs will be sucking down double the juice click click This gen is already being called lazy by some as its mostly just packing in more transistors thanks to the die shrink and then throwing power at it to bump clocks But if you think about it the same was said for Pascal its really just Maxwell shrunk and then bumping those clocks Well look what that produced 2 legendary cards the king of bang for buck 1060 and my personal stand out of the last decade the 1080ti
Maybe don t make comments if you don t have even the most basic and obvious understanding of what you are speaking about hahaha
yeah for sure but if it does fit my own case I need to remeasure again but I think it will fit snugly I will definitely be glad that level of performance is now available Personally I'm gonna make use of that power for demanding VR games where I have only been able to get low to medium graphics options on many games even with an RTX 3090
Strix is 357mm long so it will also fit as long as no front AIO
On techpowerup it says the 4090 strix is 358mm so you should be fine
Well then you re good you have 3mm to spare
They re the same value they were last gen It s the 80 series they fucked us over
1000 yeah I might do the same too tbh
If I need to include the price of the room then that's hundreds of thousands of dollars XD
To be fair not many people live in a datacenter
Oh so not 99 usage got it
It's a great case huh
I hope so I have a 4090 ordered I will update once it comes in Let s hope it really does run that cool
The original Xbox was about 8 pounds the Series X is under 10 pounds It's nowhere near that dramatic
It doesn't matter how big of a cooler you have it's still dumping the same amount of heat into your room
Jokes on you I'll just install a bigger breaker zany face
Does that thing pull 3k watts or what
Do you think they will be available on October 12th Where do they sell these I need one
Dang I hate threading directly into acrylic
My case is no SFF it is a Corsair 680X mid tower but it can only fit a 330mm card the TUF is 350mm I may exaggerated a bit but with my 360mm aio in the front the card is closer to the size of the case than being able to fit
Part of it's the challenge and part of it is just the space savings If you know your not gonna need more than a midrange card and no other add ins it works great
I live in a different state to my family and several friends It's very handy for me to be able to put my case a power cable HDMI cable 60 keyboard and mouse into a backpack and be able to do what I want when I want by connecting to a monitor or TV at my parents house
I'm not aware of there being any number attached to my case's model it is simply called HAF X Max GPU length is 340mm with the drive bays They are installed with rivets which you can remove by using a drill and drilling them out It's not a huge operation and can easily be done at home but I really don't want to do it to my case I still use a 5TB spinning disk and have a fan controller installed to the 5 25 bays This is the case there is no HAF X 922 or HAF X 930 there is only the HAF X
Like even the shape It s a perfect rectangle Something is so off lol It looks like they built it with the mindset of putting 200 of these in custom motherboards and mining them
Thank you that was touching fortunately for me I m not broke and I like to buy nice and unnecessary things Thank the lord up top
Nice
Yeah there s been no news for two years Conceptually I dig it though
If the case is a passive cooler just point a fan at it and it becomes an active cooler
Yeah most definitely I toyed with the idea of purchasing a 4090 to replace my 3090 but there's just too much in question for me right now on these new cards up to and including the power cabling So I'm going to hold off at least another generation before thinking too heavily on it though in the past week if performance claims hold up it might be hard to stay away from lol I think right now my 13900K upgrade should be enough for me with the 3090 to last until the 5000 series hit power consumption and price down by a margin 4090 is very tempting though hah
Gigabyte Eagle
How much thicker
Photos or video
I m not even sure how to respond to that You re telling me that you d gladly buy a card that most ATX PSUs can t even power alone for the sake of better performance even if it is that significant
Correction The fitting part of the analogy is that every new Lamborghini is faster and more capable with higher power But if you want to be a stickler the new urus is a SUV that is very heavy And if you compare a brand new aventador to a countach it fits right into your analogy scenario Bigger heavier hotter worse MPG
I didn't start the flawed analogy just tried to fix it Even then in your critique you are flatly wrong The cooler is bigger because the temp concentration and power draw are more acute put more demand on your PSU cost more to manufacture driving up the price are harder to ship transport without damaging and can result in sagging cards that can damage the PCIe slot There's a bunch of other factors for why the trend of larger and larger cards isn't a positive
Because they don t own their own house so they re complaining because mommy and daddy won t allow them to touch the thermostat because they pay for the electricity bill
I think you mean the 4080 4GB
Oh was it My bad then I never owned an RTX card because I m broke
Fine won t be Jesus
But if it were to exist which I m betting it will I thought it would ve been the same size since I thought they all stayed the same size which was wrong
Seriously as in
AMD is 90 as bad but less bad Intel is interesting but performance per watt on Arc doesn't look very good
Broke af
I saw it as 4090 3090ti power wise and both being 450w and mentally omitted the 1 5x though I m still not sure what that s referring to Is that 1 and a half 3090tis Because if so then I m very wrong and own up to my mistake
I mean they said that they were based on current performance stats and it wasn t even a month ago but I guess you re right
3 mm clearance lol That s if my front fans will allow it to fit I ve been strongly considering doing an AIO as I ve done on my current cards anyway
And now I need a house to put that room in Which has to exist on land Now I'm a million dollars in the hole Thanks nvidia
Fantastic Was a definite shock going from an NR200P to a Torrent in terms of size lol it s just 2L shy of four times bigger
It s funny that some believe that a bigger cooler with your card running cooler means your room is cooler Even if you water cool yes the water capacity will act as a temporary heat sink until saturation but In the end it s the power consumption that determines how hot your room gets My 3090 already heats up my room uncomfortably The 4090 is going to be much worse
If a larger cooler allows the airflow to carry out more heat wouldn't a bigger cooler even dump more heat into the room if you interpret room as outside the case
I'm starting a career as a nuclear engineer in preparation for the 6090 so I can maintain my own nuclear power station
Time to get that clothes dryer plug up in this bitch
residential breakers in na are rated for 1800w at 15a and 2400w at 20a could easily blow a 15a na breaker with a 4090 new gen set up and a few things on in the room
Yeah I wonder if the header can be swapped for one of Alphacool's other options like acetal Delrin
Yours is a later model When i bought my case there were HAF 922 and HAF 932 I've bought mine 13 years ago I'm not sure if my drive bays are like yours I hope i can find a RTX 4080 under 340 mm I love my case so much i don't want to buy a new case I couldn't find a case that i liked more than HAF 922 Only Cooler Master Cosmos and Corsair Obsidian 1000 D but they are both out of stock
So it wasn't touching since it didn't manage to temper the consumerist inside D Well I tried because I think it's more true than ever
Probably doesn't work very well since the fans aren't mounted directly to the radiator
personally i dont see why anyone with a 30 is upgrading now when the games aren't pushing the cards we have today What's the point just to say you have it
The 13900k will be a beast I have a 5950x so not really interested in upgrading the CPU at this point Honestly the 3090 is more than enough for any games I play but I do like to have the latest and greatest I was debating going for a new psu with a 16pin connector but my EVGA 1300g2 is working perfectly Maybe the cabling will be a little uglier but I already have three 8 pins going into the 3090 what's one
Oh that card's longer than the 4090 FE lol
Like 0 2 slots thicker
Both Then am both side of family events archives
I mean I would I use my gpu for work Get work done faster more time to do things charge more make more buy bigger GPU next Gen grinning face with sweat
He is telling you that he wants this card and he can fit it into the rig
Can't wait for the 4080 3 5GB
Touch rolling on the floor laughing
599
Massive difference that s why the 3090 had the BFG moniker big fu ing gpu The 4090 being even more massive is amazing
So why are you giving your input on something you know nothing about I've never been to the moon hence me not complaining about the difficulty of space travel If they need to be bigger draw more power we will deal with it x200B Cases PSUs arent expensive
That you thought they had done nothing to improve the effeciency or performance of the new generation
50 more performance at the same power If a 3090 Ti delivered 100 fps the 4090 would deliver 150 The thing is we already have some very specific number crunching from Digital Foundry videos that show the 4090 being 67 faster so in the above scenario that's 167 fps vs 100 Who knows what settings they were running the card at though if it was kept at stock power or not Personally I'm hoping to see closer to 80 improvement in at least some games and definitely in ray tracing
Yea that 360mm is with front fans installed
Maby we can get this in a Newegg bundle
Ironically I was looking at doing the other way around the Torrent to a NR200P Max Decided against it I like a near silent system
Not really atleast over your average gaming session A larger cooler would actually usually use a little more power and therefore dump more heat into your room for a stronger pump or more fans but otherwise the energy heat coming in stays the same Regardless of whether the heat in your components is being dispersed by a cooler or just regular convection through the air that heat will all end up in your room eventually
I just moved into a military privatized housing where I discovered they run 2 rooms off a single 20amp CB The house doesn't have central AC I am astonished how this is even legal Like 2 window units and a gaming PC running full tilt is gonna blow that bad boy in a heart beat
I know exactly how you feel man I was originally deadset on the STRIX so when I saw it wouldn't fit I was heartbroken that I'd either have to ruin my case or swap it entirely Eventually decided screw it just gonna get the Founder's Edition which is only 304mm and will fit easily This old beast marches on into the future I'm sure you'll be able to find a model that fits yours too especially if you aim for 4080 instead of 4090
Isn't what you are doing here just virtue signaling
Possibly Their thermal test video is pretty much useless as set up
It just depends on your display I'm running a 3090 on a 3840x1600 120hz and most new games aren't hitting 120fps
You obviously aren't doing like me and playing triple screen 7780x1440 164hz or trying to lol A lot of games look and run fine turned up but there are games this generations and like I said simulations that are hurting that could use a bunch more CPU and GPU power with triple or VR But yes in general most everything runs 'ok' or 'good enough' but I prefer the best if not getting totally crazy price wise which the 4090 is bumping absurdity versus want level pretty hard Of course in my head this is also the argument since 90 of my time on the PC is racing or flying now maybe instead of the need for more cpu and gpu I swap to triple 50 screens 4K and run them in 1080p for
Yeah I've stuck with the latest and greatest on GPUs but hung out with my 9900K because it was everything I needed until now I could use some additional core speed and core count with the simulations I run I think the 13900K will be beast it's on pre order now and hoping the embargo lifts before I'm charged and shipped so I can see some actual performance numbers I wouldn't mind trying out a new Ryzen machine as well maybe a 7950x or whatever they would call their newest x3D processor I think that's going to be the tightest game this year with parts I'm still sitting on an eVGA Platinum 1000 watt I thought about throwing a new power supply in the mix as well since I'm updating the guts but I think it would be enough still the run a 's a lot this cycle for me to think about ha I'm going to keep talking about it and end up with a fully new machine top to bottom Already sitting here staring at what is claimed to be the fastest DDr5 on the 'm headed down that path
Every custom are longer than FE
Ohh
Honestly shocking
Nice What do you shoot with And care to speak more on the actual hdd ssd nvme setup and what your workflow is I do photography in RAW as well 7d mk ii and 5d mk iv I have Lightroom installed on my C NVMe drive I edit photos with them on another NVMe drive and then save them to a storage ssd hdd
What work do you do that would benefit from a 1000w GPU
To each their own I guess
Oh well that makes sense All the launch cards looked the same size I thought all the others would ve followed the same trend That s my bad I take full responsibility for that mistake
I can read I can learn a lot about the cards They all just looked the same damn size okay
Alright I retract my previous statement then That is pretty significant
But the Newegg bundle includes a room that the computer won't fit in
That s what I had it was an awesome case I loved it problem is I m getting a 4090 and well size And needing four PCIe power ports it only had three
I absolutely aim for RTX 4080 to be heard D RTX 4090 will possibly be too expensive I've found one RTX 4080 It is MSI RTX 4080 Ventus It is under 340 mm I believe my gpu room is 340 mm as yours I'm not sure if i can find a founders edition where i live so it may not be an option for me My old beast of a midtower HAF X 922 will also march into the future i think I don't think i will change my case In time there may be other RTX 4080 models under 340 mm who knows But for now i'm thinking of buying that Ventus card from MSI I'll come back here and write if i find other cards And i'll be required to save some money for the RTX 4080 Because where i live we have high inflation and RTX 4080 costs a lot of money I wish they bring founder's edition here too We understand each other we are in a similar situation with both HAF cases So it was good to talk to you man
I hear you It would be really easy to blow a lot of cash in a build this time around Really no shortages of anything I use my computer for work as well so while the 5800x3d and probably 7800x3d are gaming beasts the additional cores of the 5950x 7950x 13900k are more appealing I think you'll be fine with the 1kw psu The max the 3090 can pull is around 500w 150w x 3 8 pins pcie bus power even during a stress test and the 13900k will max around 350 400w again only during a stress test
Great so the guy I was talking to can buy an FE instead of any custom card
D5600 Storage is a mix of ssd hdd m 2 I also run vms But weakest point atm Is software said Re learning it all
4k 6k 8k video post production And it s not that I would benefit from a 1000w gpu but everything I do would benefit from a more powerful gpu which usually means higher power consumption Even if they made them more efficient I d still choose using more power more efficiently to have more compute power
to 12 3x5 4 2 slot to 3 slot
They definitely do not all look the same size lol
Yeah it's a pretty big jump Curious how the 4090 Ti will perform and to see what the 4090 does in other games If you look back to early 20 series launch most games showed pretty bad performance gains But as the years went on newer games showed better scaling on them as they started using their technology
The newegg bundle will include a room that will catch fire and or explode
I won't be getting a 40 series any time soon I'm happy sitting on the 3080 I have for a while
Wow it s almost like many people around the world don t have access to FE cards and only custom ones Who woulda thought
I've been thinking about a Synology disk bay or dedicated NAS for the storage Do you like it
and this is the exact reason why they should be looking to further differentiate the work cards from the gaming cards
You know what that actually does make sense I m sorry for doubting you
Is this the launch card specs Because if it is then I m just dumb all around here
Well maybe to you but I m bad at judging dimensions
But will the extended warranty they always offer on parts still apply
I was gonna sit on mine but then I got given an excuse to buy one my mother wanted to get my little brother a new card for Xmas and mine s better than what she could afford so I m getting a 4090 and selling her the 3080 Ti for 500 so everyone wins
It's almost like the guy I was talking to didn't say he had any issues with it and you 2 just injected yourselves into the conversation being passive aggressive for no reason
For me it's a mix of local in desktop and rest are Nas Synolgy and Terra master Due to where I've Weather gets nasty
Nah you re fine That s why I m playing league of legends with a 3090 the gpu is necessary for work And that is an actual necessary in a common editor Davinci Resolve I ll see my VRAM usage in the 10 12GB range quite often With less VRAM I d get out of memory errors
No it doesn t The same card running at 1 3 the TDP would do all his tasks at the exact same speed and cost significantly less to run
Those are the 30 series nvidia fe model specs You can easily search for a size comparison and yeah the 3090 90 ti were a pretty hefty leap in dimensions
Then you really shouldn't be commenting on GPU sizes face with tears of joy
Summary Please watch the ENTIRE video Informative content Per Nvidia partner Failure rate is 0 05 0 1 Nvidia may provide more context on this later Any of them can fail because there are a few mode of failures and one of them involves user error Confirmed 2 Manufacturers Astron NTK Also subcontracted to Tricon Failure in general is overwhelmingly uncommon and many of the failures are very easily avoidable What are the causes Foreign object debris in the cable Caused by improper manufacturing and scraping of the bump combined with high current and or poor connection Creating poor points of contacts Extremely improper insertion by user Improper insertion in combination with a taut wire on one or more pins Causing one point of poor contact that heats up GN also went on to debunk several theories out there Not going to summarize them Please watch to understand some of the misinformation out there Conclusion Cables are melting when connector is unseated It requires being very unseated AND pulling the cable at an angle Did not fail when tested unseated but not being pulled at an angle Partial insertion and angling of the pin into the socket could have increased susceptibility for a high resistance parallel connection at the lip of the socket Failure Analysis Lab Testing sent to GN Any debris will make this worse Failures are rare Don't chase specific adapter as any of them can fail Anxiety surrounding the issue might exacerbate the issue When people are unplugging and re plugging it could create foreign object debris not common User error when re plugging the connector Purely objectively GN feels you should be comfortable using 12VHPWR connector but it requires them to be fully connected and seated Critical There should not be any gap Push the cable until you can't wiggle it out anymore GN gave an example of how he could pull the seemingly fully inserted cable out by wiggling it out this is an indication that the cable is NOT fully seated Added to Megathread
So the top likely failure cause is from incorrect insertion Another failure cause but less likely is from foreign object debris from manufacturing
Information with actual reasearch testing and evidence I tip my hat to GN
Tl dw all cables are susceptible even the cablemod ones And the cause seems to be mostly user error with some poor design and manufacturing error thrown in It could also be argued the user error is caused by poor design
Thanks I was waiting for someone to post this as I couldn't
Cablemod has taken advantage of this issue real good lol
Finally some clarity GN once again doing the work Estimation of failures is 0 05 to 0 1 Basically it's mostly user error with connectors that aren't fully seated design oversight on the adapters that should have a clear audible click Fringe cases of connectors with internal debris causing contacts where there shouldn't be
Lmao Cablemod making bank on user errors
I know one conclusion I support Igor's lab is not a good source for these fear gate news The guy jumps the gun and is wrong often Capacitor gate cable gate What next Igor Thank god we have Steve GN Johnny Guru etc
The knock against JayzTwoCents at the end was just classic
TLDW PLUG THE DAMN CABLE IN ALL THE WAY NOT JUST MOST OR ALMOST
so once again Igor'sLab kept writing BS since multiple weeks face with rolling eyes being so confident about themself with at least 3 different theories looks like Ampere Capacitor drama remember Igor'sLab back in the day lmao
width 1444 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 6394685810a7fcd685c81d79ac9a8f5504e89870 All the posts on the mega thread legit don t have the connector fully seated
Nvidia would have benefited from a snap tactile feed back and maybe a bit wider of a locking mechanism here I think one of the issues is the GPU Bezel obstructing the 12pin connector so if the GPU is installed where you cant see the connector gap poof
Looks like NVIDIA and PCI SIG are working on a solution From the comments I m no cable expert but in regards to not properly plugged in this should be easily avoided if a single signal pin was shorter and not allow current to pass through unless it has contact Gamers Nexus Correct They're looking into that for a revision as we understand it That's a collaborative effort involving NVIDIA and people at PCI SIG to ratify it
You already know jay is going to make a 30 minutes video copy pasting what gamer nexus says with some lame ass jokes
JonnyGuru came up with a similar conclusion a few weeks ago and got shit on for it Some people on this sub owe that guy an apology
Lol a while ago everyone in this sub acts like the 4090 is a time bomb and a recall is coming I honestly doubt even 10 of the overreacting folks owns or planning to get a 4090 anyway Also screw sensational youtubers for creating drama just for their engagement and clicks I almost returned my card due to the FUD thankfully I didn't and it's nice to get a confirmation from actual test that it's mostly user error I have 0 gaps and running the card smoothly for weeks
So basically bad insertion and wear from too many insertions
Combo of not inserting all the way with a bend With a slight chance of debris from bad manufacturing
Steve is fantastic at not jumping to conclusions doing
Some adapters like mine can't be fully plugged in all the way no matter what Fucking PERIOD In such cases NVIDIA or partners needs to provide an adapter at no cost that doesn't suffer from this issue
I would love to buy GN gear but money is tight right now However I will give some information about this relating to my electrical engineering job experience I have designed prototyped tested revised and found alternate parts for many types of connectors Mainly molex minifit and microfit which look similar to this connector I've also touched on DSUB M series Phoenix contact and some automotive style connectors 1 The 'tulip' style contacts are commonly referred to as RMF This stands for Reduced Mating Force There is less friction for the pins to slide together and they make sense for high pin count designs 12 However in my 2 years of experience they have failed 7 times Whereas normal pins have failed once We redesigned the cables with RMF tulip to use normal contacts The failure rate was way too high for the short 8 month 15qty lifespan we started with 7 contacts in 1300 contacts failed 2 We always went with gold plated contacts when designing cables They cost between 2 and 7 times more but I personally never experienced a failure due to these gold plated contacts Tin nickle plated were always assigned as first alternatives though So I'm not sure what impact that would have when going to tin 3 I am not sure why the general shift away from 3 6 8pin connectors toward a single larger connector is good Do we like plugging in motherboard 24pin connectors Not only is the clipping sound feature less prominent on higher position count connectors the feature on smaller connector families microfit is even less reliable to fasten I guess NVIDIA ATX is going thru an expensive lesson to figure that out Higher position connectors require higher cable quantity which requires larger bend radius and less flexibility 4 I have touched hundreds of thousands of contacts and thousands of similar microfit minifit connectors I have assembled harnesses professionally and have an extremely small encounter rate for connectors with 'defects' No more than 5 but only 1 I can even remember Foreign objects in the connector housing are likely to be deposited by machinery at the harness manufacturer Also defects are typically batch wide if problematic at a part level If there are more technical questions about harness design please feel free to reply I can also pass along extremely detailed questions to my peer who has been assembling harnesses for 30 years
Apparently even cablemod cables can burn flushed face
SHORT short version User error with a slight chance of metal flakes in the adapter due to manufacturing defects and poor nickel coating Also very difficult to reproduce Cable fastening solution needs to be improved and there should be a mechanism to alert user in cases of bad insertion Gamers Nexus wins the Only tech YouTube channel worth watching award Thanks Steve
Even if it's a user error why do people give a pass to the design of the connector so easily It's not that good of a design Have you watched the video Steve inserts the cable leaving 1mm or even less of space and it's still not in And there's no feedback at all no click no nothing And the only way to check is to pull But how hard Mobo 24pin hard I once cut myself on a case because 24pin didn't want to let go and once it let go I hit my hand on the case Nothing good will come from people pulling on cables really hard just to check if it's in And now realistically you need to first connect the adapter and then put the GPU inside the case They either need to add a tactile feedback or check if it's properly seated
This is the most amazing set of tests ive ever seen This is why GN is the true PC messiah
FYI we do have cables on the way to Steve to have them stress tested to see at what point they melt
You mean to tell me jayztwocents was click baiting and actually had no idea what was going on Shocking
On user error I have a hard time believing that people who claim to be experienced builders and said they inserted the plug fully are just wrong I could buy that they didn't get it all the way in but 5mms of space left That's a lot I also find it a little bit distressing how easy it was for them to pull out a plug that looks like it was fully inserted so I wonder how often these plugs are working themself free over time I think the sort of forensic look at cables to show they weren't all the way inserted after failure makes sense although I don't understand this stuff well enough to know if that's definitive or if there are alternate explanations On design I think they really could have called Nvidia to task more for allowing these things to stay powered on with the cable partially engaged Part of the reason I've been skeptical of user error is I didn't think the card would power on if the instillation was that bad It's good they're revising the cable to include an instillation safety feature if it's true and if GN is correct in their analysis that'll fix this issue but I don't think there's a good justification for these releasing without a necessary safety feature On the whole it's an excellent video but it's also definitely going to be ammo for people who want to defend Nvidia's handling of all this which leaves me with mixed feelings because I've staked my flag in the this is a problem camp and I'm not looking forward to the Nvidia did nothing wrong takes
I dodged a bullet then I have the 4090 tuf and after reading about cables burning down here I checked my connection What do ya know it was about 2mm not inserted But let me tell you after trying to reseat it it simply wouldn't go in all the way Like if I tried to force it the port on the card felt like it was going to snap It simply wouldn't go in I got a moddiy adapter and it went in first time with a satisfying click I'm not sure if this is just user error or more poor quality cables that are impossible to insert correctly without destroying your cards port
To be fair there s almost no feedback for plugging it in correctly
Ah the guy milked the hell out of this issue Thanks GN again for actual work
plug em in good boys and enjoy
Well that put my mind at ease Now to find a 4090 lol
Of course it's Tech Jesus to the rescue
Well 2 weeks ago we from Teclab tested and show width 1169 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 00b189201dc4a5e76ef70ecb5ef765331feba0fb Our video detailed with extreme tests Teclab 12VHPWR testing
Hmm I can see how this is a design issue I had to really shove my connector in hard to get it to click As in I had to push down hard enough that I was concerned I'd snap off the connector itself or damage the pcie socket under the card before it properly latched This all points to a poor latching mechanism design in combination with cables that are manufactured right on the very edge of vacuum injection molding tolerances These connectors are going to need to be manufactured to tighter tolerances in my opinion It actually may not be a terrible design decision to swap the classic plastic latching mechanism with screw posts to tighten the connector down In the meantime NVIDIA and AIB s should all put out a PSA explaining how to properly insert the cable and that in some cases excessive force may be required to do so In the meantime to allow the cable to connect more easily it might be wise to lubricate the connector with some 99 9 isopropyl alcohol immediately before insertion It'll evaporate quickly after insertion and is non conductive Either way this whole thing screams poor design
So about 98 of the melted cable spam in here was actually user error Good job everyone
Pulling a 1up over Igor Well done
I lost a bit of faith in Igor's Lab after watching this vid
A lot of user just got exposed as bad builder and I m gunna guess they ll not take it well
Tldr cable not plugged in all the way or maybe foreign object inside the cable To be clear ANY cable or adapter can melt Doesn't matter who makes the adapter or cable
People ain t gonna like being told it was their own fault but facts are facts
The mad lads did it They made it melt after a lot of work and research It's pretty crazy that the card can turn on and run while that far unseated Well worth watching the full thing to see how rigorous they were
How the heck are people leaving it MILIMETERS unplugged
Even if the issue is user error it is up to Nvidia to design a system that does not lead to repeated user errors that can lead to literal fire and melting
So it's like 90 user error but with a design that heavily encourages user error On that note can we just push to get rid of these plastic clips alltogether please I can't be the only person who hates them with a burning passion The 24 pin connector is the absolute worst in that regard There has got to be a better way of securing those connectors
There s no click and people are reporting they overly pushed it in and still not sure if it was seated correctly
Nvidia should pay GN through their teeth for this
User error poor engineering
I'm wondering how secure the latch on this connector is I have had eight pin connectors actually come unlatched when I went back later and did some cable management Seems like this connector specifically this adapter would be prone to something like that This whole thing probably could be avoided if the PCI spec was for the catches to be in the socket and latch into female connectors on the plug
This makes me wonder for much how user error a company has to account With all products there will be a tiny amount of manufacturing defects which will lead to bad products But if the majority of failures are caused by severe user error is the company actually responsible for that I mean this level of bad connection they needed to recreate the melting was extreme
Good thing Walmart has an early black Friday sale on Copium
Gonna play devil s advocate here please enlighten me Why on EARTH is a 2500 product this susceptible to user error From what I m reading here this is considered normal and uncommon Why has this never happened in a previous generation if this is expected and obvious How is this normal Please help me understand because as of right now I m not touching 40 series with a 10 foot pole
What I don't understand is why would there be so many reports online about this issue when something like that has never happened in a comparable proportion with regular PCI e 6 8 pin connectors Could this testing be subject of a small sample size as in potentially different or more of some sort of the studied problems affect a significant proportion of these adapters cables but the precise percentage affected couldn't be reflected in this testing because of the sample size Otherwise what phenomenon would explain a nothing burger have such a large impact in the reporting within the community Could such a rare 1 issue get so mass reported that it became extremely well known in the space Something doesn't add up imho
Here are some images from posts I found in the mega thread These were some of the more obvious ones but to me it seems a vast majority of them were due to plugs not being seated properly A common tell is when there is a bubble of melted plastic that has oozed out because there was a few mm gap or when it melts all the way stopping a few mm short Wouldn't happen if it was fully seated How do people not see that the plug is not fully in I just don't get it Partial blame also goes to Nvidia for not picking a better latching connector and not putting a label or something on the plug stating it must be seated in completely That's why we have common sense labels on everything because well people PSA If you can't do it get an adult to help you width 1952 format png auto webp v enabled s f3b77b1092402d0da5c2c595b119ded08a9ffaac
Honestly i wasnt the biggest fan of Steve but that man has earned my respect Thats a lot of hard work well done
So in a nutshell it's bad design that results in user error
I can't believe that some of y'all were leaving half of the cable unplugged and then act surprised that it melted like holy shit if you leave any cable half plugged it's prone to failure
So this whole thing has been a PEBKAC issue
Glad I watched this made my get out of my comfort mindset Just replaced my MB and sure enough when I put the GPU back in the 12VHPWR wasn't connected fully Tiny Tiny gap on the one side 1mm maybe Luckily no melted pins and it definitely clicked this time Gamers Nexus to save the day once again
What bugs me the most is the fact that a complete 3rd party is performing tests to figure out why this is happening while Nvidia stays silent Nvidia must think this is acceptable for an item that costs 2000 and that it'll all blow over soon enough
How come no 3090 ti melted GN should test this on a 3090 ti connector
Will this video finally put a stop to people posting pictures of perfectly fine and unmelted 12VHPWR connectors
To quote Hal 9000 It can only be attributable to human error
Plug the adapter onto the gpu outside of the case first
POSCAPs
A properly designed connector doesn't have a incorrectly inserted mode It should only conduct when it's safe to do so
Just as expected mostly user error to all the salty pocket watchers here that were so happy and wished people with 4090s that their house to burn down it was no coincidence that the melting went from 4 5 cases a day in the beggining to 1 every few days people started plugging it in fully and didnt bend the cables that hard
Looks like expensive video to make Loads of testing Lots of good brains Am not even gonna buy this but every PC sub was full with meme and weird legal shit calling for house to burn and what not I hope this is the end of this Let's move on to some real tech upgrades
So what's going to happen to the three daily posts of pictures of people's adapters that get upvoted to the top of this sub every single fucking day Will they need to be titled I plugged in my adapter wrong or will people just be too ashamed to upload anymore edit spelling
So user error It was pretty obvious from the beginning that when YouTubers Tech Journalists and even manufacturers were unable to reproduce the issue that it wasn t that big of an issue to begin with and there were some very specific circumstances to create the issue which came down to either user error or a defective batch of adaptors Now we know
PEBKAC STRIKES AGAIN
Hilarious that there were so many people on this board claiming that the failure rate was as high as 10 rolling on the floor laughing
Even if this is caused by user error such products should have fail safes or error signals built into them for user error Hopefully Nvidia will somehow improve this product because a lot of cables may move out from vibrations and cable management
Just finished watching the entire video YES At the end of the video he alluded to that portion of the video being uncomfortable because it indirectly criticizes his peers He even mentions Jay of Jaystwocents Of which Jay did not take kindly to my comment on his video about this topic as he left a snarky comment to mine I had said he and others were sensationalizing something that was not fully understood yet I may have also told him that if he was going to do investigative reporting to do some actual investigating I also left a link to another video of someone in the know who had done some actual testing Steve's video confirms I was thinking it through correctly Though I could have came across nicer in my comment to Jay's video
Damn There was a reason I wasn t worried about my 4090
I get the feeling that EVGA's unreleased RTX 4090 design with the cable on the end of the card would be less susceptible to wiggling out since that location isn't likely to be under as much strain
YOU ARE A PLUGGING the cable wrong is the new you are holding the phone wrong
So So Soooo no class action lawsuit No new house No new psu First time ever the Reddit mob has been wrong Shucks
Vindicating Nvidia is not your friend but my god did this issue bring out the classic capital G gamers en force While these connectors could be better designed you have to be a legit moron to get it to melt
One should wonder the f are those extra 4 pins for then Their only job was to report shit's not connected
Lol There will be more post on cable melting cuz the 4080 is out
Brilliant Explains why I am at almost 5 weeks of ownership running max volts and power without a single issue My adapter isn't faulty and it is plugged in correctly Good to know it's not likely it will fail in the future
Just bought another item from their store I can't help but support the incredible quality of Gamers Nexus content
Failure rate is extremely low just need to be extra safe when plugging in the cable
So at the end is he calling out Jay Because Jay has been pretty bad with the sensationalism IMO at least among the larger subscribed YouTubers It's very off putting
My MSI gaming trio cable doesn't click doe believe me ive jammed that shit in there and I get no audible click
So jonnyGURU was right It's easy to replicate someone else findings But before his findings nobody talked about that
So looks like it was a lot of fearmongering going on after all
Everyone is ignoring how this is only over a sample rate of about a month and how this is just going to get worse as the cards and cables get older and experience more natural wear and tear This doesn't answer Why this card and not others It doesn't address How can I keep this from happening three years from now And also doesn't address What happens if I did everything right and this still happens Just remember Samsung and lots of YouTube outlets tried saying the Note 7s were exploding because people left them out in the
I've seen some comments here and on YouTube remarking on how GN came out with this info prior to NVIDIA Which Theoretically fair but could y'all imagine what would have happened if NVIDIA had come out first claiming mosly user error Way this sub was acting no one would have accepted that information Wouldn't be surprised if they already did their invest wand just waited for a third party to announce first so people didn't jump all over them
If you guys are reading this as 100 user error that is 100 of the fault of the user you have an agenda I just watched this and it's definitely a bad design with a lot of things that can increase the chance of user error Those here that are like See Not Nvidia's fault either need to rewatch or stop being corporatists Poor design often results in user error You don't owe nvidia anything you already paid what you owed them when you bought your gpu Being an Nvidia customer is not a part of your personality Stop this
So should I be getting the 3rd party power cables or not
All the bros who rushed to push that adapter into your 4090 you have my sympathy But thanks for bringing this issue to light with all your pictures Now we know what not to do
Has anyone else noticed that only mods can create threads now
Does that mean that even I buy overpriced 3rd party cable such as Cablemod it could fail as well
Foreign objective in the connector would be next to impossible to see or clean by user given how tiny the hole is This time we all probably would have appreciated a bigger hole
Redesign needed Longer pins and or a wider holding clip or even two holding clips on the far left and right instead of a small one in the middle to eliminate wiggle as best as possible
I d love to know how many 4090 s were sacrificed in the making of this video
So would it be wise to blow out the connector with compressed air before use
can somebody tell me if u cablemod's cable has an audible click
So finally we have an answer now the question do a 4080 lower tdp under these circumstances can melt
I'm not owning a 4090 or anything close to that but in defense to people that thought they inserted their cable well x200B I was getting front panel USB C connection issues and unplugged and plugged back in the cable multiple times in the motherboard with a lot of force and never got a click I was afraid to push more because I have a 500eur motherboard and didnt want to break it One day I just said to myself fuck it so I used an unreasonably huge force to the point the board was flexing a lot and my fingers hurt like hell even got an imprint on thumb skin for a day or
Whelp upgraded to a cable mod for no real reason I suppose Do appreciate the direct connection and better looking cable so doesn t feel like wasted money at least
hey look so they are looking at a solution so if the adapter doesn't insert fully it might not allow the current to pass through But Nvidia couldn't have done better
The sideband should prevent against user installation error It should not be connected until the cable is latched Any earlier risks the unintended high resistance path made worse by the sideband confirming the cable is fully connected Painful lesson but should be fixable
So if GN is right it seems like the 4080 is going to have the exact same issue unless they've managed a stealth revision to the cable
Brendan Frasier is back and is pissed about video cards
Advice to 4090 owners based on this video provided I'm not firmly in the haters gonna hate camp Visually inspect your connection if you can see any part of the rectangular pin housings 's thumbnail it's improperly installed and you need to reinstall If you can't see the housings and particularly if you didn't hear feel a click when you installed give the cable a mild tug not like you're pulling the sword in the stone if it starts to come loose it's a bad install and you need to reinstall and have that top connector click into place If it just won't click I don't know what to tell you keep an eye on it and try to make sure there's not undue pressure on the cable that could allow it to be pulled out over time
GN is the best
This is really refreshing It was pretty annoying seeing the number of posts about the melting cables and this proves its a very vocal minority
Just curious but if GPU Z reports 12 3V on the 12V gpu pin that's good right Can't remember if more voltage there was indicating good contact or bad
imagine being a 4090 buyer and not being smart enough to plug in a cable fullyrolling on the floor laughing Btw I'm a 4090 owner myself also the comment is made on purpose to get dislikes face with tears of joy
I mean of course the tldr is plug in the cable all the way But why is nobody talking about the fact that the lap told Gamersnexus that the protective tin gets immediately destroyed and leaves the connector open for oxidation If the main problem now is that the connectors melt when having a bad connection then what will happen when all the cables are oxidized Will we be in a situation where we gotta replace oxidized cables every year The whole problem just screams cheap manufacturing at every point Edit used the word rust instead of oxidation a few times
So it was a nothing burger after all
Lol So it was mostly idiots doing it to themselves and blaming everything else How surprising
Hahahaha what do you know people are stupid Colour me shocked
So its baisicly bad design
I haven t had a click on mine but been gaming nonstop for 3 days no issues at all
Damn so it was user error all along I see
S there's almost nothing wrong with the cable but people are too stupid to not verify the cables are actually fully plugged in That's funny as hell But at the same time from a design standpoint some amount of user error should NOT result in melting expensive products
Not surprised Whenever someone has a PC issue it's usually user error from my experience
Gamers Nexus is the shit Wasn't sure if they were going to come through since they were quiet on this for awhile but like they said in the video good reporting and thorough analysis takes time and they came through All hail Tech Jesus Pretty much have been saying the exact same thing in my recent post history and was downvoted Based off JohnnyGuru's testing and Galax TecLab's testing video and a bunch of photos people were posting of their connection clearly being not plugged in all the way it wasn't hard to come to the conclusion that a compromised connection was causing the heat and melting Both of them pretty much stopped short of melting the connectors with a loose connection but observed quick rising temperatures as a result of a loose connection Gamers Nexus went the full mile to actually prove it and deserves all the praise and support An additional excellent observation Gamers Nexus made was the wear marks on the connector due to not being plugged all the way in softening due to heat and most likely had some weight on the cable at an angle due to cable management That was a great catch With the failure rate being so low the debris theory cause is most likely even lower and not a likely problem But it might be worth taking a closer look and inspection to see if there's any debris in the connectors prior to insertion And maybe beneficial to use some compressed air on the connectors to ready them for insertion The 12VHPWR is less robust less durable and has less tolerance than the old 6 pin PCIE and uses more wattage The design is definitively less idiot fail proof and has lower margin of error There are more terminals per connector and they are also smaller per terminal lower fit tolerance which makes it harder to plug in by default There's much less sense of 'set and forget' as with the 6 pin PCIE Maybe future improvements like shortening of the sense pins the card not working unless the connector is fully plugged in a better connector locking clicking mechanism or having a temp sensor at the connector that shuts the card down if it goes over a certain temperature etc can help but until then the melted connectors will always be a concern with the 12VHPWR
how could PCI SIG approve such tiny plug for so many Watts
Linus must be having a baby right now looking at his new factory and all his employees and they didn't come close to doing what Steve and his team of three did
Things should be idiot proof but if they are not idiot proof yet work perfectly when used correctly and yours fails what does that make you I'm no fan of Nvidia but people who were shouting from the mountain tops that Nvidia released a dangerous connector must be feeling pretty dumb right now
So basically the design could be better but it's not defective It promotes user error and especially with this connector standard the user error produces catastrophic results Hopefully they are revising the connector to make it more foolproof You could make the argument that other PC connectors are also susceptible to user error but how many of them result in a 450W component starting to have runaway thermals that result in melting and a potential fire hazard Imagine if you didn't fully seat a 24 pin motherboard connector and it kept humming along until your motherboard started melting

Wow so many peoples now pointing on that is user error and few days ago they want to sue Nvidia This is completely rushed poor designed connector both on gpu and adapter My 5y old Gigabyte 980ti that use 2x8pin had 3 types of led indicators above each port that indicates if connection is good white yellow red Connected bad connection not connected If they knew that new standard is more problematic which it is they should add some kind of protection or indication I don t blame users at all even if they didn t put they connector all the way down that is again poor design they made it so hard to put them in and is almost hard to see if connector is not fully plugged Overall completely bad quality and poor design they know this that is why they already working on revision they wouldn t do this if it s user error And I bet that of affected users are much higher then what they claim
i will wait for peer review on this issue if you even think 1 source is all you need for research does not matter how good it is that bad research the rule of thumb is a min of 3 different sources coming to the same
Design needs to be for a lack of a better term Idiot Proof User error is encouraged because of that Users need to be careful Manufacturer's should idiot proof the connectors
Of course its user error
Idk about that People said they were still getting melt even when they did hear the click of the cable Also it s happening way more than it should
The problem was dumb people with too much money
It's actually impressive how poorly it has to be inserted for this to happen no wonder it's so rare it's really just people not even attempting to plug it in all the way
So whats the excuse from the antiwork labor crowd now that their modern Jesus took away their scapegoat for not purchasing one of these Still want to stick it to the man when it turns out it wasn't the mans fault Fucking sad how many people wanted to assume it was Nvidias' fault Total confirmation bias as to why they didn't want to buy the card Oh wait never mind the reasons have always been 1 they are hard to get and 2 they are out of their price range Looks like they don't spontaneously combust now what Inb4 all the still wont buy comments like anyone gives a shit
None of this would've happened if they put 3 FUCKIN 8 PIN POWER CONNECTORS ON THE PCB
Surprise surprise its user error This sub has been in a fit about the bad pricing for weeks and so lost all perspective about the tiny handful of these failure cases I'm sure someone will still pitch in how this all should be 100 foolproof but the 0 05 failure rate is pretty huge evidence it itself that its only the dumbest most careless users experiencing this
gif giphy TseBjMu53JgWc I swear I'm gonna lose my shit if I see another mention of that clown Jayztwocents He makes glaring mistakes that are only made by tech illiterate people He said that AMD CPUs don't have AVX instructions He plugged an external gpu enclosure into a laptop's HDMI out port He bought one of the best dynamic mics in the world didn't know how to use it and complained that it sucks He drilled holes into a motherboard to fit a bigger heatsink He basically had one board with mounting holes but wanted mounting holes in another board and made the assumption that since one board manufacturer put mounting holes there other manufacturers wouldn't run traces there Peak stupidity was reached when he didn't even check the backside of the motherboard because traces were clearly visible Even if traces aren't visible on either side motherboards have multiple layers He's a total ass on Twitter too
This is great Hopefully all this nonsense ends now and the people dogging on the 4090 can just admit it's pure envy Jon Gerow was right this entire time and people have dragged his name over it
At this point i ask myself why this mess with this connector and not with years and years and years of usual 8 pin pcie If it is a bad insert
So debris can melt your gpu do not remove the cable cause a debris can melt your gpu 2k gpu and an adapter technically assembled by a bunch of geniuses but a single grain of dust can fuck everything up Lol
but wait there are some people had their cables melted and they said that its seated fully and made sure it clicked also they didnt even bend it because they were aware of the melting issue so how can we explain these cases according to GN even if there are foreign object debris it wont cause the melt unless if combined with unseating and angle bent its great from GN to be able to reproduce the case and find the causes backed up by facts based on the limited samples they have access to but i still believe there are other cases happened to cables properly seated and not angled which GN didn't have access to and sent directly to AIBs and Nvidia so i guess the best thing to do if you own a 4090 is to get a proper cable Adapter Although GN said all of them are prone to melt but better quality cables are less prone to melt make sure its fully seated and not angle bent then keep praying
So the failures are predominately caused by people who can afford a 1500 GPU but not fully insert a connector Gotta love it
Are you telling me that this is all because people can't push a fucking cable in until you hear a click I've reseated my 4090 about 3 times already it really isn't difficult to know if the adapter is pushed in all the way
Amazing video and findings But I find it hard to believe that all of those reported cases were as unplugged as Steve's cables in the video It was only in like 50
God bless you Tech Jesus and your band of merry men
It seems that the connector is not so bad it's just that some users have crooked hands
So it s all user error
I GOT DOWNVOTED SO HARD FOR SAYING IT WAS USER ERROR SUCK IT LOSERS
4090 buyers are really idiots I m one of em loudly crying face
What if Nvidia burns my house down Only yourself to blame I guess
People need to calm down and just enjoy their cards I knew it was mostly user error
Just as I thought all the REEEEE FIRE people were overreacting and wrong Just learn to plug the damn thing in lmao I think most of that was driven by people who really want a 4090 but can't afford one so they're overly excited to shit on it every chance they get because if they can't be happy no one should
When I posted here like 2 weeks ago that it wasn t about the bending the downvote was insane
Looks like I'm switching to the red team this gen Wowza
More reason to stop watching Jay
It's your fault we designed the plug this way
Almost can't believe it are people really this stupid not plugging the connector all the way in
Failure rate is 0 05 0 1 Failure in general is overwhelmingly uncommon Pick one 0 1 is not overwhelmingly uncommon it's 1 in 1000 That's super high
As usual redditors who can't even plug in their cable correctly blew this thing way out of proportions what else is new
Confirmed those buying 4090s are not intelligent people
Baffles me that people who are buying this card don't know how to properly plug them in Isn't the 4090 considered a hobbyist card and as such a hobbyist should be expected to know the basics of pc building Just to be clear I'm not defending NVIDIA or any of the producers it's obvious that the design exacerbates the potential of user error
Well done video from GN This is going to ruin alot of Nvidia haters day but atleast they have the 4080 pricing to feed their hatred for now
Congratz to Gamers Nexus for the work you guys always try to go the extra mile x200B Now about Nvidia people have been saying they are too incompetent how they take so much time to find the problem with all the resources they have and that they were just waiting for someone else to find it instead of putting up the work x200B I believe Nvidia probably found the problem in a couple of days and were stuck ever since looking for a solution You saw peoples reaction to the MSI image Just imagine how people would cry and scream at Nvidia if their response was Its not our fault its user error it would be another PR desaster so they probably are trying to find a way to make the cable more user error proof before come to public with an answer
Hats off to GN and the whole team Meanwhile Nvidia are playing with their balls and sitting with their thumb up their ass Unbelievable that a respectable YouTube channel has been able to issue a statement on this before a multi billion dollar company
Man do feel vindicated Glad I didn't waste too much of my time worried about this shitl lmao
The misinformation was getting out of control Someone HAD to step up
I respect GN and Steve to the core and yes there might be issue with improper cable insertion however the blame here is bad engineering by INTEL in first place the overall design then blindly adopted by Nvidia and none of the companies tested it correctly that plug shouldn't ever get a release clearance by any safety board So if people fail to plug it correctly and usually those buying premium cards KNOW HOW to assemble a PC and connect the cables it is a design failure so no excuse Nvidia and Intel msi 4090 Supreme Liquid X here in operation from 22 10 2022 with original 600W bios no melting so far using only provided PSU cables 4X8PIN and provided nvidia adapter excellent performance but daily sniffing around the case and keeping my eye on the card makes me nervous inspected the adapter connector once since installation
First of all great work They did gpo above and beyond and found the reason for the problem Cables not seated correctly However I disagree that user error is the ultimate culprit Nvidia knew about the dimensions of the cards and the average dimension of a PC case They designed a cable that couldn't be bend for the first inches They were the ones that chose the location of the plug on the cards They didn't add a locking mechanism or any safety precautions If they had done their job the failure rate would be nonexistent If I design a car that explodes if I try to fill it up at a slight angle it's not user error Nvidia was too busy figuring out how much they could charge instead of designing the cards correctly
inb4 It's bad design causing user error That radiates the same type of energy as I drank Bleach because the label didn't say no
They got it to melt without a case So being in a case doesnt matter yall Also that debris one seems like something that could be a common reason Everyones got stuff flying around you dont know what can find itself in the socket
Often the truth is hard for the ear Now this is a proper video title
Video card fire insurance soon to become a thing
They can't just say failure rate is 0 05 0 1 without the context though lol I would say to watch for MTBF and FIT statistics at this point
Basically PLUG THE CABLE IN ALL THE WAY But also there should definitely be a click when its fully plugged in
As I expected user error and not properly plugging the cable in checking for proper connection seated cable
Proud GN supporter for years and like them I couldn't help but cringe at the coverage by morons like Jayz2Cents Igor's Labs and Paul's Hardware GN is the PhD researcher in the room while the other morons are children who barely know how to write their names Sad how the later group specially the spiky haired old man are able to draw in more people to influence Would love to see the faces of the idiots whose connector's burnt now that they know it's most certainly their own fault I think NVIDIA and other AIB partners should voic warranties on such melted connector RMA requests based on GN's findings
Sorry tech jesus but that conclusion is the most anti consumer and pro corpo I've ever seen from him His sample of 1 case of an extremely badly inserted adapter is no indicative of anything here people have reported cases of melting with good insertion click and everything Concludes there's little fault on manufacturing and it's debris or the standard itself and it's more of an user error pulling another you're holding it wrong bs Look how many decades have the 6 and 8 pin connectors been around there's probably hundreds of thousands of user errors and over the span of 20 years how many cases of melted connectors or ports too little to count compared to the cases in 1 month of the debut of the 12 pin connector and note the quotes because this thing basically debuted already with the 30 FE series was this an issue with the 450w 3090ti and it's superior power consumption and transient spikes no are you gonna tell me people have suddenly become stupid with the 4090 with a port many people is familiar with already Also there's gray scales in the punishment for user error a pc crash is something artifacts blackouts another but melting burning an putting people at risk is WAAAY high up there in scale the fact that users have to be this CAREFUL with this thing is a standard issue don't pass the blame to the user for making such a flimsy connector Just think about it Steve is recommending you NOT to unplug the cable to see if there's no melting because it would be unseated when re inserted like common sense would tell you mid sentence hmm why am I recommending this when I have never done this for other standards getting to the extreme of taking these precautions it's just ridiculous IMO And we haven't spoken about degradation what's gonna happen after 6 months 1 year 3 5 after selling them used switching owners and being manipulated between different motherboards and power supplies The issue is the standard I'm disappointed Steve doesn't see this takes his sample of a handful as factual for every case and disrespectfully assumes all the cases are user error then makes a risky statement by saying life goes on you'll be just fine with your adapter Really bad stuff time will tell about these early adopters
Those cards have not seen the summer probably not seen much dust either and the connectors are still new so not used on more than one GPU and the material will age too
Come on kiddies DIDNT your mummy and daddy ever say to you dont play with plugs And if you do make sure they are fully inserted in ROFL
Ouch bit of a burn for the people with damaged cables
So much for the many malevolent idiots
I called it I expect all of you to return my downvotes A simple case of poor contact combined with high wattage high capacitance heat Occam s razor wins again Sometimes user error sometimes a poor connector tolerance Either way not a massive deal worthy of the hatred fueled drama queens on here If it fits without issue and clicks you re good
Thank god Finally facts and testing to prove it s not a huge meltdown like the drama queens on this sub were implying
So its 2022 and now people who build PC's way back 9500gt suddenly doesn't know how to install a GPU Yea lets blame the users
Since it's an inherent flaw of the connector what's the minimum power at which the failure occurs Will we see 4080 reports next
Glad to see them call out the difficulty in building this story among pre set Anit Nvidia madness Hard to collect data when so many will come to you with a bias I m glad the air s been cleared though this was a crazy video to watch Fucking X raying and Cross Sectioning power supply cables and adapters was not on my bingo card this year
Love Steve and the GN team to death but this video could have been half the length
Igors lab with the hypotheticals lol
At this point if you don't just wanna be entertained but watch something objective unbiased and competent what else are you gonna do but watch GN Every other tech Youtuber fails this standard
In before other YouTube channels the usual culprits make videos that paraphrase and basically just regurgitate GN findings rather than just sharing a link to GN's video
More FAKE news just good plain old USER ERROR Cable not inserted correctly you'd thinking if spending so much on just the GPU you could build a fucking computer
How the FUCK did a journalism channel give info faster than a billion dollar company Why's Nvidia so silent
I get that NVIDIA could have dome something better for the connection but for it to come down to such user error is kinda baad for the PCMR Like its freaking common sense make sure all connections are all the way in no matter what part or component it might be and due to that incompetence by users it really scared a lot of ppl away from the 40 series and NVIDIA 'all
Some people are going to be so sad that nvidia wont have to recall all those 40 series GPU
Sad we live in an age that people wont believe something until they see it on youtube
Is it still worth waiting for my cablemod to ship
Edited thanks for pointing out the numbers 0 1 of 100 000 is a lot of failures It's not just dozens anymore that is 100 affected people Even if it was 0 05 that is 50 people That surely puts things in perspective
Convenient Run defense hard as fuck for nvidia until actually independent testers make it an untenable position then come around and act like you knew all along get all the praise Classic GN
All you morons are just not plugging in your graphics cards Thats fucking rich yall are dumb af you guys shouldn't even have 1600 dollars to spend on a GPU if you aren't smart enough to plug it in fully
Nvidia has ruined this generation of cards for me even with seating the power cable correctly I would still always be worried about it Waiting for the 5000 series to see if they can get their heads out of their asses
So much cheering in this thread Yeah lets call people stupid and quickly un stick that infamous thread User error FTW Nothing to do here move along How convenient
BETTER GO BUY CABLEMOD
Didnt think the outrage would get so large U didnt need to be a rocket scientist to understand what the cause was but internet is internet and I bet that it was over exaggerated by the AMD fanbois they always make stuff larger than life when it comes to intel nvidia but ignore any issues with amd
RECALL these cards all need new power ports that abandons this design how long will it take before someone has a melted connector that arcs
praise Jesus
Called it weeks ago
Doesn't seem to shed any light on the native 12VHPWR failures on the MSI Ai1000 units though Has anyone seen any info about these
It s like a seatbelt make it click you bloody Neanderthals
this guys are fixing Nvida problems for free
Can someone please clarify this for me I'm not watching this video and not reading this reddit thread as I don't have time Thanks
All that effort ruined by a cheap sensationalist
I see that Nvidia is still in denial Thank you GN Also this ATX3 tech seems to be of poor quality as of now I doubt Nvidia decided to push it and force partners to install it for free
Theres no mention about the cable being bent downwards I have an o11 dynamic and would like to install normally not vertically but was going to verticle mount due to cable bend is that not an issue
When I'm gaming I feel my case and the part of thr card that gets hot is where the psu cable goes in
I always wondered why there werent any pictures of how the cable was plugged in before they took it out and posted online The cable seems to be extremally engineered with some slight oversight
Because of videos like this GN is the best
GN killing it
for some reason I couldn't post this but at least someone was able to share it here
Yep much smaller issue than reported by some and the vast majority from people not plugging their cable in properly lol
I got a super stupid question Wouldn't like a yellow line on the adapters be added and when it's not seen and you can't wiggle the connector out it's inserted correctly
So you're saying I bought this pitchfork for nothing
My cable and gpu connector produce an audible click
Does this mean Corsair will feel safe to start back selling their 12VHPWR cable now It hasn t been in stock since launch
Hilarious I was right from the beginning when I said user error and I got ridiculed
I have a 4090FE with a native cable to my PSU I checked if there was any melting a couple of days after I got it and everything was fine It's been about 2 weeks now should I bother checking again Kind of worried it might mess something up
Hmm
So this is still unique to the new connector as we ve been irresponsible with the 8 pin especially 6 2 for years At least with traditional connections each connector only ever has to accommodate 150w This connector has 4 12v leads all connected in parallel and bridged at the connector That means the bridged 12v plane always has to accommodate the full wattage drawn Not sure if this is split up on the card side hopefully it is The point is making a small connector that is too snug to plug in easily with no audible or tactile feedback that the connection is complete and cable managing it in a tight space with other cables and hardware sheds light on what might be a theoretically fine connector but a poor design for its use case
Number 1 cause of electrical fires Poor or improper terminations
unfortunately blaming this on user error which it very well could be gives the manufactures an excuse to deny our RMA claims if something like this happens to our cards
How can you not sit a connector It has a clip there that doesn't make a click sound when not fully inserted and it even is visible Just curious
The failure rate is honestly better than I expected as I expected it to be around 0 3 1 6 So basically make sure it's fully plugged in not pulled at an angle by for example your case side pulling the cable when you're closing it which pulls the plugged in adapter with it at an angle I don't really understand what a taut wire means is it just pulling the cable hard in one direction while also leaving no leeway for it like a adapter cable being bent hard and pulled hard into the case for aesthethics instead of being left relaxed and bended normally
It's a risk
nVidia frantically scribbling notes so they can finally report that they completed their investigation
why did he put the sweat emoji on nvidia lol
He should get an ad buy as a thank you from Nvidia but then he'll be called a shill so yall better buy some Merch lol
3 Tech Jesus
Alright going back up to 75 power limit let's go I ordered from cablemods out of panic and now I feel like it's probably wasted money but at least it will be aesthetically
Yea no shit
When was the last time we all had to do all this for a GPU cable lmao It s kinda crazy Let s see if my 4090 bites the bullet one day I haven t games much Need to invite my naphew who can game hours straight to truly test it face with tears of joy But too bad he is 5 hour flight away
Ah yea I was was waiting for this video
Report by the BBC
I'm thinking about something they could try as a revision for the 12 Pin IDK if it can work or not but basically since it is mostly user error from not being seated in all the way what about recessing the 4 sense pins at the top so that they only make contact with the GPU when it is actually inserted in all the way without contact the card does not power on and add an LED or something on top of the GPU side or cable to indicate its the 4 sense pins not sensed lol
Does this mean we're out of the woods or is there more work to be done
The extensiveness of their testing was really impressive here This is probably the most impressive video I've seen them do I also really appreciate that somebody finally reproduce a failure instead of just doing theorycraft I'm a little frustrated though that they didn't address what I feel like is the fundamental question Is this a fire hazard or isn't it I mean you have a 300C connector it's putting off a lot of smoke is it going to burst into flames or isn't it
The 10 discount code from the end of the video should be I'M FINE to match the sticker on the thermal camera So disappointing s
NIGEL THOOOOORBBERRY
So the examples where there is a fully seated cable are likely caused by debris
TLDR the melting cable issue is generally caused by user error Basically nothing has changed from before just use common sense and best practice when connecting hardware And there are always going to be stupid careless people who don't seat the connections properly and end up with melting cables and or fire hazards
TL DW Users might be dumb Didn't stick the cable in properly
face with open mouthface with open mouthface with open mouthface with open mouth
It s funny that improper insertion hasn t happened with any other gpu on the market nor has any of the issues present in the 4000 series gpu s almost sounds like self protection from lawsuit and blaming others Nvidia is riding the wave to the bottom and their prices aren t worth the cards Company needs to own up and fix the issues along with correctly pricing their gpu s back in the day I thought the titan Z was insanely priced because it wasn t for the average gamer and now their new series cost the exact same for an unsurprisingly less amount of what you get for your money Bye bye nvidia you had a good run
So just a bunch of user fail and poor design from the card manufacturer honestly at this point just stick to the 3080's and the 3090's They basically function the same as a 4090 but with proper adaptors I guess or wait till Nvidia reforms the current adaptor style to fit in properly with no gap whatsoever
When I get home from work I m gonna shove in that connector with all my might
Good guy Steve
That s what she said
Okay so what do I do with my unit where the retention tab broke off the 12vhpwr port making proper insertion impossible I can easily pull the cable out with barely any force because there's no retention tab to lock it in place My RMA was denied
That's what she said
Basically everyone was right except Igor looks like and we can all stop arguing now Improper seating is primarily the reason for melting user error Card is easy to improperly seat and powers on even if not seated properly design issue Some melting could have occurred due to debris in connectors manufacturing defect Failure rates 0 05 0 1 not a widespread issue
I m wondering if one can detect incorrect insertion from some sense pins Seems like a problem with the spec of the cable
JohnnyGURU basically said the same thing and was attacked by most people on this forum
I think it s fair to argue pretty strongly that this really is caused by poor design although it wouldn t happen if every user was a pc builder experts that thoroughly read the manual had previous knowledge of what it means to properly and fully insert the cable A cable with this much power running through it and with such dire consequences if it s not installed properly just shouldn t be possible to install wrongly in the first place The connector should be such that any user would be certain it s installed properly and such that it s easy to instruct the user of when it s not inserted properly
it's like installing a CPU cooler poorly the thermals will go up if you mount it wrong but the cooler itself is fine if the cable is in properly these failure scenarios should not happen and GN's data reinforces this idea
It could also be argued the user error is caused by poor design On some cards that are hard to plug in due to poorly molded QC'd connectors like some of the TUF's we have seen 'd argue the design is fine it's the QC that is failing Many cards especially FE's are by many end user accounts very easy to fully seat and click into place for example
It could also be argued the user error is caused by poor design It is entirely due to poor design Users think the cable is firmly seated but it is not GN's video clearly shows this The loud click from 6 and 8 pin PEGs is not there Further the GPU will still turn on if proper contact has not been made It is a very poorly thought out design It doesn't really take into account how normal people might use it or work with it
I think user error is something no manufacturer can stop And if users keep checking their connectors they will scrap off the coating creating foreign debris Maybe Cablemod will hold your hand give you a reassuring squeeze and double check your connection with every cable Use code SqueezeMEgently for 10 off face with tears of joy
The amount of builds I see with the 4090 in a small case and the adapter being routed sideways is quite disturbing I often comment on these that the case is not compatible and the adapter shouldn't be bent like this and get downvoted In short if your case is not compatible you either need a new case or a different gpu
It is a crappy design it's a rather large plug with many pins it makes you wanna wiggle it probably more than you should to properly insert it all the way and there is no audible click or good enough physical
It is absolutely the case that user error is due to bad design If seating the cable fully and properly is this important it should be designed in a way that it clicks only when it is properly seated I don't think any of these findings excuse Nvidia and they still have to fix this
User error could be caused by the card not fitting into a percentage of cases
User error exacerbated by poor design
Yep The root cause may be user error but the design should be changed to prevent or at least mitigate it the best it can
Also known as a design induced user error
It could also be argued the user error is caused by poor design That was kind of the conclusion they came to in the video the plug goes stiff before it is seated and even when fully seated does not click I don't think users can really be blamed if the connector has a seated in feeling when it is still loose
Same here I was confused of why the submission button was disabled
Starforge went all in for cablemod cables and starting promising customers a bigger case for 5 cm bending radius and shit I got downvoted for saying they're overreacting and need to wait to find the issue
GN just proved there is no need for aftermarket cables Cablemod already made their sales by popping into almost every thread multiple times I expect them to go relatively radio silent moving forward
This is why I love GN their work is on par with what I'd expect from a vendor doing a quality control related root cause analysis Good stuff great analysis and testing The end result doesn't surprise me either
I was sort of shocked when i first plugged it in there was no audible or tactile click of any kind but pulling and repushing confirmed it was attached Not the best design choice considering pretty much every single other plug involved in a PC's wiring clicks
I saw this Stat and realize a bunch of people in this sub need to eat their words around all the adapters melting and downvoting anyone that says otherwise
mostly user error Debris and poor ease of inserting are not simply user error as pointed out by gamers nexus If it is too easy to fail insertion its defective May cases still lack the clearance to use this connector without tugging on the wires which tugs on the connector Why spin their findings CCS charging cables for EVs that have had sagging issues and pin separation just shuts them off instead of burning your car's charge port NACS solves that so nvidia needs their version of NACS A smaller connector that is easier to insert so pin separation won't happen GN confirmed two pins can handle the full load by cutting the other ones off Nvidia could have gone with less pins with better quality couplers for the same price per cable If gravity can contribute to pin separation it's a defect no matter how you look at it It means melting connectors can be random
Homer 0 05 to 0 1 so far
Basically it's mostly user error with connectors that aren't fully seated design oversight on the adapters that should have a clear audible click I wouldn't fully blame this on user error I can say for a fact the Cablemod is much easier to push in than the adapter If it's hard to push a cable in then it's the fabrication tolerances that are the problem It seems almost every Cablemod clips on easily with a click So that says something
Here are some highlights I found in the megathread These are the obvious ones but wouldn't be surprised if vast majority of them were caused by user error x200B width 1952 format png auto webp v enabled s 40bb30d2c586e3e1c929efc9d4f4fca5c9487e04
Thats the same failure rate I guesstimated I knew it couldn't be that common like you would assume from all the posts
overengineering something and missing a key thing to lower the failure rate
I ve written software for users and you really can t make a smarter user I ve had a guy annoy me all day at work once because he couldn t figure out how to fill out his name He was fired for being so dumb he couldn t actually fill out a basic form as a part of his job
Gamer Nexus did what NVDIA engineers have failed to do There is no point in buying expensive and overpriced Cablemod then I'll keep my stock cable then What a sigh of relief
If other NVIDIA have the same connector and don t have those issues then it s not the connector being bad but a batch not being made properly
Estimation of failures is 0 05 to 0 1 Basically it's mostly user error with connectors that aren't fully seated design oversight on the adapters that should have a clear audible click Fringe cases of connectors with internal debris causing contacts where there shouldn't be Sounds like a design flaw rather than blaming consumers when none of the other connectors have this issue
I wonder how all the tHeY nEed tO reCaLl thEsE yeStErdAY dingalings feel right now Knee jerk reactions are never good
Where are they getting that 0 05 number from It's not from reddit posts is it I just watched through the video and I don't believe that's explained Unless it's from the manufacturers' return numbers it's probably not super accurate But even if we do go with that 0 1 is pretty high for connector melts and possibly starts a fire failure I don't know how many 4090s they sold but that's going to be thousands of melted connectors
I wondered with the no click and blaming user After the build you tighten clean up the cables If it is fully seated and I twist or pull the cable a bit does it come unseated This is something I have never worried about in the past Also if I have a lot of tension on the cable as it heats will it move a tiny bit And I am not talking one week more like six to twelve months down the road In the past people really pull cables tight and trusted them
So poor design
I don t understand the most user error argument though The people who justify the cost of a 4090 aren t people who are beginners to PC building they re people who are coming from years of high end gaming cards like the 2080 and 3090 etc for them to be having user errors with something as easy as plugging the power connector in it has to be a design issue
It doesn't feel like 0 05 0 1 of 4090's are having this issue though Unless every single person with the issue has gone online and talked about it
Tbh I would ve bought a CableMod cable regardless the stock adapter looks terrible
In engineering if a new design is causing an increase in user error compared to previous designs then it makes it a bad design doesn't it
I would much rather have the CM cable over the nasty hydra cable NVIDIA gives
Well played CableMod well played
From hysteria
I ve been saying this since the beginning Crazy how they were all over the forums highlighting the issue and their SAFE cables in literally every post they could Fear mongering and profiteering
Did they even release their new cables I imagine they're sweating real hard watching this video
Cablemod's adapter might inadvertently fix the problem though I would guess that much of the user error is a result of people trying to fit the adapter in their case thus pulling the cable partially out of the socket The 90 and 180 degree adapters will alleviate the awkwardness of Nvidia's adapter and may result in fewer people messing it up
To be fair after getting the cable it looks pretty sick and looks much nicer than 4 cables so it was definetly worth it for me just for how clean it looks now
The Cablemod is much easier to insert and to hear the audible click From another post of mine I wouldn't fully blame this on user error I can say for a fact the Cablemod is much easier to push in than the adapter If it's hard to push a cable in then it's the fabrication tolerances that are the problem It seems almost every Cablemod clips on easily with a click So that says something
i bet they werent expecting this video to come out so soon But if ppl can use it to not aggressively bend the cables should be good
i would buy their anyway i mean default Corsair cables are hard to deal with
Capitalizing on this is questionable However all standalone 12vhpwr cables cablemod moddiy oem psu should all be better than the adapter if the standalone cables carry less weight bulk and are easier to bend to avoid resistance against the case side panel that would cause an up down side bend at the connection mentioned in GN's video My oem psu 12vhpwr cable is actually really rigid and had potential for side bend on vertical axis prior to me bending the cable and giving proper slack to cable I would think cablemod's modflex cable wouldn't have this issue at all since it's really flexible
The adapter looks terrible anyway and cablemod pricing is reasonable
No If a company makes a product which is so highly susceptible to user error it is the company's fault CableMod is making bank by making a superior product which customers actually want
The correct way to use the cable invalidates some cases Not user error at all Lots of people have the side off waiting for a cable they can close the side panel on and still have cable seated properly
If I'm understanding correctly their cable still shouldn't be at risk to malfunction like this since it seems to be caused by a combination of improper connection and side to side strain You're not really going to get the later on a right angle connector
Yes but I've found the cablemod cable clicks better and makes better contact with my GPU then the stock nvidia one where I don't feel I could get it to click no matter how hard I pushed
Buying one for the aesthetic
I mentioned in one of Igor's earlier speculations that he seems to be just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks and seems I was right I hope he takes this as a lesson and is more careful in what he posts in the future with more data to back him up
At this point I reflexively downvote whenever people post EGOr's lab
Yup After this last one his site has been deleted from my bookmarks
Igor s stuff make him sound extremely like a be quiet shill to be honest
And or Igor's
Good Jayz click baity bullshit and cablemod shilling was nauseating considering they had multiple 4090s for review and were never able to reproduce the issue
I mean J2C always claims he s just an average guy who builds PCs in his videos which is most of his appeal So far his reactions and videos seems perfectly on par with what s posted on here and other pc building subs
Well jay made maybe 6 vids each going double or triple of GN video views If anything that jay guy knows his marketing shit Hez good at it
Jay is nothing but a bag full of knee jerk clickbait 'opinions' these days opinions he presents as fact and has little to NO credibility to back up People need to learn to ignore him at this point That's probably the only thing that will make him reconsider his current line of bullshit
So that msi graphic that people flamed was right
TL addendum The connector design isn't the best as you get no tactile feedback that the cable is fully inserted
This many 'user errors' indicates poor design of the cable spec itself How many lightly fried pcie powered graphics cards do we have going on at the moment
If you said that before this video you were downvoted into oblivion
Not the first time I see Igor's lab ending up like 're good or something
Apparently some adapters can't be fully plugged in all the way no matter what utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 utm source share utm medium web2x context 3
I too have noticed this on the mega thread
It is because some are almost physically impossible to get fully seated
I would wager virtually all pictures with clearly incorrectly inserted connectors in the megathread where obviously taken after it had already melted to demonstrate any potential bend issue arising from their case The respective poster of your linked example at least clearly said so after getting the same concerned replies But still you can also see the bending lines GN mentioned or distinct out bubbling beyond a clearly defined point resulting from partial insertion on a few posted examples in the megathread So it's not like the majority isn't user incompetence u n19htmare has some in his collage later in this thread but it also contains some of the likely erroneous bending demonstration pics
Some of the obvious ones I spotted form the megathread Wouldn't be surprised if nearly all of them were because of improper install x200B width 1952 format png auto webp v enabled s 802ee7a322e4c56bb2c545d6807fc52cfe6f3faa

Yes indeed The people making the most noise were never going to buy the card and the ones who wanted to still did Hence the 100k units sold I've been running mine since launch day max overclock no issues
Reddit wants the 40xx series to fail because most redditors are butthurt that they can't afford the most powerful GPU on the planet Add in shitty YouTubers Jay especially stoking outrage for ad revenue and you get a wonderful spiral of increasing hate
So you re holding it wrong with a few added steps will be the tact NVIDIA takes but benevolently offer new cables These should be easy to insert give good solid feedback CLICK that the cable is seated and should survive dozens of connections I worked in durable customer goods manufacturing and in almost all cases we treated products failing to perform as expected as a manufacturing or design defect
It's a little more than that 1 It's easy to plug in the connector improperly since it requires a lot of force and doesn't provide a substantial click 2 If it's plugged in just slightly improperly things will appear to work fine however because the connection isn't locked it can become further disconnected with cable management and vibrations 3 The card will continue to power on if the connector is barely connected which NVIDIA is in talks with PCI SIG to fix 4 Foreign object debris either random bits of plastic from the factory or dust from the user's environment adds the final piece of the puzzle creating high resistance contact points It's user error but it's also poor design I think the PCI SIG revision will clear up 99 of the failure cases
It s not too much wear when it s failing on the first insertion for most people That s just a this could happen down the road speculation This is flatly people were not plugging it in all the way just as JonnyGuru and MSI suggested and people lost their shit over And GN couldn t reproduce it with the connector unseated just a little it had to be very unseated one example had the connector out by 1 3 of the length of the connector The connector could have been improved to make that easier but this was ultimately a user error story after all just as so many people fought against it being
People panic checking their cables and removing inserting many more times than is necessary increases the likelihood of a failure People doing it to themselves
Hold on So the whole issue has been dumb users all the time
YO FINALLY WE HAVE IT REPRODUCED HOORAAAAAH
Not really It's damage to the plug caused by too many insertions because the manufacturing quality is bad
More like plastic debris that could get in but a rare occurrence compared to already rare foreign object already in
Some are legit defective Debree in the terminals One user posted such poor build quality that plastic was visible in the terminals and the adapter wouldn't fully plug in What percentage of the melted adapters are user error and what percentage is defect I don't know But based on the numbers quoted in the video most adapters aren't defective
Is it Jay you are talking about lol
Yea I've heard this complaint pop up quite a bit numerous people have said they can't get their connector to click in no matter how much force they give it Do we still consider those to be user error too
You should make a video of that and post it Sounds dangerous to have those kind of adapters out there
Exactly that's the main issue 't blame the user if the fricking adapter doesn't click in and can lead to become incorrectly seated Also being so fricking short and stiff makes it even worse way more prone to become incorrectly seated with movements of cables etc
Yes with those cases I feel like Gamers Nexus went to much on the User Error reasoning If they build connectors with such bad tolerances that it cannot be inserted fully than some people will think that it's already in With the 8 Pins I used to far it was always it is definitely not plugged in or it is plugged it When you have such a high resistance that it can feel securely plugged in then that is bad tolerances I am an engineer and from my understanding this is not user error The product is made for consumers so they have to design it that way Also what is about the potential oxidation that GN talked about
They would have done that from day one defective parts are clearly covered by people create problems when there isn't one
But how will they profit when they have to shell out 20 per unit You're gonna bleed them dry stop being poor and buy a cable mod cable S
Shit at this rate Nvidia would've been better off using Packard connectors I am curious though what do you think would be the ideal connector for applications like this if you were starting from scratch
there was this joke about using USB C connectors but on a serious note what is the problem if they actually tried implementing 4x USB C 100W rated cables cost prohibitive
Yea I've gotta support them for this analysis Its damn fine work and I'm generally not a fan of buying youtuber merch
I'm not paying 30 for 4 fucking coasters I like GN but that's a ripoff Give me like 10 coasters at the least for that bonkers price
I would but not having a material that absorbs condensation on a coaster makes them usable in hot humid climates Cork cardboard or any other material like that is the only solution
Any cable can burn if it's not inserted correctly
Now they can stop shilling their cable here
I think the reason why cablemod cables aren't burning is because of how easy it is apparently to insert it and hear an actual click while other cables you need massive force to plug it in
I don't think we are giving the design a pass at all I'd argue that melting or potential fire hazard due to any level of user error is a design error During my installation I still remember that I was left in doubt if I had it in far enough since there was no feedback I do know I don't have it loose enough to cause melting but am I sure that it's in fully Nope
Steve literally says it s a combination of user error and bad design that encourages user error He says this pretty early on in the vid but I think everyone here just tuned out the second he said user error because anything else would be perceived as an attack on Nvidia Additionally there could be longer term issues surrounding debris in cable oxidation in the coating on cable or GPU side but very clearly this didn t contribute to the vast majority of cases Probably best thing anyone can do is to Use compressed air on the pins cable and gpu side Get some dielectric grease if you re not sure about contact per Jonny Guru s recommendation because cable can stiffen well before contact is actually made
From what I have heard some people's cards cables cannot properly seat for whatever reason As in they attempt to have it click but they can still just tug and have it pop off If it appears to be true that any cable is susceptible to this problem then I think a bigger thing to test is which cables or brands are better at avoiding improperly seated cables
My 12v cable arrived today with one pin unseated from the 12v side not sure if it s safe to push back in and use it with everything surrounding these cards
Same issue with my Gigabyte It just takes a huge amount of force to get in There obviously good and bad cables out there I am waiting for my Cablemod one and will throw the standard one away I think they will silently replace the cables with new releases and hope the problem goes away It's easier to just blame users
Same issue with a native A100G the cable would not go in properly on either side I heard a click but a few millimeters of the cable were still visible I moved to a Thermaltake GF3 which did snap in on both sides flush but the cable quality is so bad it requires a bend to fit it into my 7000x properly so I have zero clue if the other side could have came loose I'm waiting on cablemod and then finally I might feel safe No graphics card should require this much stress and rely so much on the build quality of a third party
Same with my 4090 TUF and be quiet adapter I'm currently waiting for my Cablemod adapter People who haven't experienced the variance in different adapters cables can't understand it
From the video it seems you need to plug it in super incorrectly not just a tiny bit
Except you can pull on it and if it comes out it's not latched in How is this difficult
I like how he has casually dropped in a few videos I'm going to bring a 4090 home and get to the bottom of this under normal use conditions Ignoring the hours and hours of benchmarking and overclocking they have already done with no failures
he always talks out of his ass
Honestly companies should take the courage and ban providing sample GPUs to such dishonest content creators Aren t they responsible for fake news
Came here to say this
The next card is going to have clips screws and glue
Could also use some dielectric grease as lubricant
Yes but at what ratio does the design oversight on the adapters go from user error to unintended user behavior If someone THINKS the cable is secured and then attempts to clean up the slack for better cable management then at what point is is a design flaw when it can unseat the cable and allow for for a high resistance parallel connection to cause the melting especially no warning or indication that something has gone wrong
No if something has a user failure rate that is that easy to occur with few signs of feedback a clear and audible click that's a manufacturing error
It looks like the cable can shift during cable routing if it wasn't inserted and clicked in properly Even being off by 1mm can shift to 3 or 4 if the cable is moved around enough
Easy even my adapter feels like I have to use a hammer to get it in The amount of force needed for some adapters is insane Nobody wants to put a huge amount of force on a 2000 dollar GPU
I was wondering about this too Only thing i came up with is they are probably thinking this is too tight i better not push anymore or it will break
Well there is definitely some blame on the design and manufacturing for sure I literally cannot get any 'click' at all And it is as firmly pushed in as I can possibly do Ive looked at it far too much honestly and its as flush with the gpu as possible So if its not counted as being seated properly who is to blame here I was not reckless with it I did not bend it near the connector despite there being no documentation supplied with and no a 3rd party link after the fact doesnt count if I need to know this it should be somewhere in on the packaging and I pushed it in being mindful of wiggling even using increased force as it was very tight No click tho I would say time will tell but not with me as I am going to change to the Seasonic cable whenever it arrives And yes I watched the video completely I am aware this can happen to any cable However I have more faith in Seasonic and the bend will be easier to manage and hopefully a nice click along with being fully flush will put my mind at ease
They are working with the standards body to get a revision to that effect that said the incidence rate is presently 0 1 of owners It is not just on NVIDIA there is an entire industry standard at play here
I'm a senior principal engineer for a tier one OEM 0 05 to 0 1 failure rate is well within normal tolerances Could the connector be better designed Sure anything can be But Nvidia didn't design it PCI SIG did And the very good analysis shows that this is mostly user error No one was screaming this loud with the PLETHORA of MOLEX burning we used to see which was also mostly user error It's because it's a 1600 GPU burning and not a 20 fan or 50 fan hub
There is Some manufacturers use a sliding lock tab that is built into the connector it is not removable and slightly wedge shaped with a divot When it is fully connected you push the tab with your thumb you hold the connector like you are pulling rope and when it reaches the connector housing it clicks and sits in a divot To remove it though you need some strength to overcome the divot or just use a flat blade screwdriver or even a pen to pry it c 2
I totally agree I recently had a helluva time pulling out the 24 pin out of my motherboard when the cable's been there for a few years Similarly the clip on my 4090 power adapter cable seemed like something that would not be the most durable thing in the world in the first place If you were to take the cable out for any reason often enough I could see it eventually breaking off It doesn't help that the adapter was designed for basically no good situation where it takes so much space that putting it inside a lot of cases has been difficult without going for extreme bends I wish GN had also clarified if bending the adapter significantly is actually ok considering this is what you would have to do when you are low on space in a case Those 8 pin cables you normally use never had this sort of issue and took minimal extra space when installed space accounted for in pretty much every case out there
He also mentions poor click and force needed for a proper mount to have The issue still remain that the cable can walk back when not fully seated and then cause a fire It should stop sending power before it has walked back that much The logic pin change can help with that but I don't think it will totally fix it
Steve s word is god in this sub The hive mind isn t going to like this
Now watch how those thoughts got downvoted into the oblivion the last weeks User error Never Must be Nvidia s fault Their non communication on this was dumb tho Maybe they avoided or dodged this and were too cowardish to tell us exactly this that s a user error And feared even more backlash
User error through bad design allowing it to happen That's the key thing to take away
Even though that might be a likely culprit Nvidia needs to fucking say something
It's pretty crazy to me that a connection that bad would even turn on Like some prebuilt PC manufacturers super glue cables into their ports because if they come loose during shipping the whole PC won't boot
People spending 1600 on a video card are more likely to frequent this subreddit and other technophile forums
I think a lot of it has to do with 1 Higher power 450 600W is a big jump from the 300 350 days especially at 600W That higher heat density and additional strain on the connector is contributing 2 Lots of eyes on this connector specifically where people might not have really checked previously and if they didn't get a shutdown level failure might not have noticed 3 Some design issues potentially leading to user error 4 Appears to be some manf issues as well though maybe not wide spread
These cards massive stressing users to fit them in cases more than previously The adapter truly sucks I never had this hard of a time pushing in 6 8pins in a GPU but the adapter the card ships with is just awful doesn't feel good at all Which coupled with these cards having massive shrouds where you can't even really see if the cable is plugged all the way compounds problems
regurar pci e connectors are SO MUCH easier to plug correctly that the probability of a bad connection that could lead to problems is much lower Could such a rare 1 issue get so mass reported that it became extremely well known in the space 99 9 of the users aren't reporting about having a problem for obvious reasons
I feel like most computer cables like this fail to work properly if they aren't plugged in all the way especially this far out A combination of a new cable that is much harder to plug in than previous cables combined with space restrictions due to bigger cards requiring bending of the cable to fit in normal cases with highest power draw and a cable that works while not fully seated results in a higher failure rate GN also points out that paranoia around this could easily cause people to screw themselves by giving things more chances to fail due to unplugging the cable to check for melting But the joking conspiracy theory I have if that this all was part of some nefarious AMD plot to delay people from purchasing 4090s until they could launch
Probably this is more easy to fit wrong and the tolerances are worse meaning that the 8 pin can take more abuse current relatively to rated load before melting
Well those photos with the plug in the card are clearly not fully inserted but I don't have any context on those I don't know why someone would install it like that maybe they just reach a point of really high physical resistance and assume that's the way it's supposed to be
This is pretty consistent of the quality of content GN pumps out on a regular basis I don t know if there s any one report review that made me respect Steve All I know is that GN has really high standards when it comes to reporting and analysis and that Steve carries himself with a level of professionalism humbleness that is rare to find in this space or anywhere else for that matter
This is the same company that tried to sell a 4070 Ti as a 12gb 4080 for 900 They don t care about customers just money
That s what I do for both the motherboard and the GPU Plug cables into motherboard then lower the board and the cables into the case Pull cables into cable management holes as you lower it in Makes it much easier to deal with the EPS connectors in the upper left side of the board usually I can t get my fingers in there once the motherboard is installed Same for the GPU plug the cable into the GPU and then lower it into the case pulling the cable into the holes as you go
I like to do this with a lot of things I never feel comfortable pushing so hard on the motherboard
You can rule out every consumer power plug then Fuck even the wall connector for 90 of the world
Is the megathread now a list of shame
ERROR CODE PEBKAC Replace user and try again
I mean Steve is Tech Jesus after all
If they can have a temp sensor on the connector that will shut off crash the card or even give a desktop notification after it goes above a certain temperature that'd be great Kind of like how CPUs have shut off protection features
What did Jay say to you
To cater to every idiot out there one day there might be a mandatory instruction telling them to pull up their pants after shitting in every public toilet
We enjoyed the amazing gaming my friend lol 2 weeks ago someone already got the connector hot being unseated on video and people kept thinking there's a super big conspiracy with nvidia
Agreed
It's also better for ram cooling as the cables don't interfere with a ram fan
Better visibility to the user and better finger access would help
I have an EVGA FTW 3090 Ti with the same configuration Been using it for months with no issues I did straighten out the cable after hearing about this No smoke yet
Yeah that's probably a good summary A cable should slide in and click A phone should work regardless if your hand bridges the two antennas The specs for the wires pins ect are totally fine the mechanical tolerances for insertion are bad
Oh no this is still a design problem that could lead to lawsuits it is EASY for a reasonable person not to plug this in correctly
Nvidia didn't even design the connector lol
You re a moron if you possess knowledge if you got no idea of it all you will make a mistake so shut up
They are connected but barely That creates poor contact that leads to higher resistence that leads to high heat
Jay put out a video every week repeating Igor's stuff So yeah he was talking about Jay lol
Jay and Igor
Remember how Jay and many other YouTubers were going on about the POSCAP SP CAP issue on the 3090 after Igor published his theory as well It was completely sensationalized and unfounded Being the first to publish something on the issue nets them views and revenue so they are incentivized to push things out without a detailed analysis Safe to say I would not take their word as golden until more information is out there by reputable sources GN Buildzoid etc GN's video gave us a detailed failure analysis and recreation of the issue so that now I have peace of mind to purchase the 4090 which I've been holding off
This is a big design flaw it need to be corrected I think If you wiggle the cable from side to side as shown in the video will it come out If not it's probably fully inserted You can try inserting the adaptor outside the case and before putting the card in the PCIE slot if you haven't already this makes it much easier

Every connector will meld for defects or user error or damaged card it happened countless of time with the old 8pin but no one paid attention because there was no hysteria
It did address how you can keep it from happening Plug it in all the way
They did the right thing I guess
The fact that you re trying to make this about people being corporatists and their personality being defined by being an Nvidia customer mostly tells me that you have an agenda Sure the plug looks like it could be designed better But when the failure rate is 0 05 0 1 I m personally going to assign the users almost all of the blame at that point You saw in the video the conditions required for them to reproduce this right That s a lot of user error lol
It's not 100 user error is mainly user error because they either didn't fully plugged in or defects prevented it to be and decided that nah it will be fine and kept using the card instead of asking an RMA you can find some of them arguing here The remaining are defects that any product have the 8pin wasn't immune from that
You don t have to just make sure it s fully plugged in
Lockdown today due to 4080 launch day me first rtx 4080 review day launch day Will probably unlock it soon
If you don't plug it in all the way and bend it yup
It did the first time I plugged it in but didn't the second when I had to adjust it a bit
I imagine it could now be a damaged board connector issue from users jamming unmercifully trying to seat the connector catch and ripping the delicate 12 pin connector off the GPU board
Agreed the cable shouldn't work until 100 or as close as tolerance would allow inserted especially with sense pins on board I've seen burnt up 8 pins and it was people screwing up the 6 2 and leaving pins not inserted all the way
Same but tbf I was terrified when I was trying to plug it in as I was using so much force and It Just Wouldn't Click Until I used even more force and it did Thought I was gonna tear that sucker out the pcie slot though
Copper doesn't rust
But why is nobody talking about the fact that the lap told Gamersnexus that the protective tin gets immediately destroyed and leaves the connector open for oxidation If the main problem now is that the connectors melt when having a bad connection then what will happen when all the cables are oxidized Will we be in a situation where we gotta replace oxidized cables every year The whole problem just screams cheap manufacturing at every point No attention span to watch the whole video jump into the comments screaming about user error
Just the usual shit New gen of cards comes out invariably something goes wrong with a tiny portion of them people assume it's a widespread problem and cry for recall and attack the developer turns out it's nothing goes quiet Repeat a couple of years later
No its user error people arent plugging them in properly
Worth checking that it s fully seated
Why are you maligning people completely uninvolved in this for no reason
They are busy making money on more LTT merch
and they didn't come close to doing what Steve and his team of three did To be fair they didn't do all the work They sent cables to 3rd party for scans
Linus is for the common person Steve is for the enthusiast
I feel like those people will just double down and find something else to whine about I also blame reddit for being extremely hyperbolic Guilty of it myself sometimes but people take things way too far
How many of them power a 450W component the old 8pin melted too even with lower power cards defects and user error will cause problem with any connector
You're just seeing reddit overcorrecting A lot of people who were blaming the user are using this to justify their beliefs while ignoring that as good as gn is it's still as you pointed out only one source You have people here even claiming that the class action is dead in the water Let me tell you not a single judge in the U S would look at the gn video and be like yup that's it Gn said it's user error so class action dismissed
1 is fine if it matches what you want to believe
If you build an Idiot Proof device the world will produce a better idiot
Steve literally said it s a combo of user error and partly a design that encourages user error it seems like everyone tuned that out Guess everyone should be using dielectric grease to make sure they ve got it in all the way
it's really just people not even attempting to plug it in all the way Then you didn't watch the video closely Steve specifically showed that you could plug it in deep enough that it looks like it's fully seated and then it could walk itself out again due to cable strain
They cost more then 2k instead of 1600
What a dumb rant
Those melt too
8pin melt relatively regularly nothing is safe from dumb mistake and defects but there simply wasn't any hysteria so way less posted and no one paid attention
Way to take it to the extreme buddy A single grain of sand lodged in your artery would fk you up too
They lied father
I've used this adapter on my 3090ti and 4090 never had problems but never heard a satisfying click or anything letting me know for sure it's well connected It's not that easy to be sure it's really in all the way as it can offer good resistance when you plug it in and they can be a bit hard to unplug as well The fact they end up being squished against the glass panel in many setups likely doesn't help the situation as it could exercise enough pressure to give the angle necessary for bad contacts Human error in most cases sure but those adapters still don't offer an enjoyable experience at all They're ugly ass haywire looking adapters that are a pain in the ass to use
Not everybody has a click neither does the adapter go in easily Mine has no click takes extraordinary force to seat
An audible click and being easier to insert would be good things to have the design is not helping Thankfully they are shortening the sense part of the cable in future revisions so it will not turn on if not fully inserted
The failure rates are low but saying that to get in the connector into my 4090 Gigabyte felt like I was cracking my motherboard there is also no click So there is a real issue with this You could easily screw this up Normally you don't need a flashlight to see a connector is in So it's more your crooked assumptions
Did we watch the same video How are FOBs inside the connector that the user cannot see or shitty plating a less future problem maybe a user error
Not entirely
Don't worry It was wishful thinking for those that can't afford the thing made them feel better for not getting one almost made it seem like a 'choice' on their behalf lol like a 'choice' not to support Nvidia as if thats some big hill to die on when the majority of them had 3080s and shit
Mob mentality mostly The group IQ often equal to the lowest and loudest
Bending plays a role too though
Have fun with drivers Best of luck to you as competition is good and needed
12VHPWR is a tricky connector to plug in fully You have to use an enormous amount of force just to plug into the connector There are manufacturing variances where some cables are easier to plug into others Some cables are extremely hard to plug in fully Theres not really much of an audible click on the 12VHPWR connector Sometimes you have to feel the click before you know that the connector is fully inserted Its just a badly design connector
I remember seeing the 5700xt had a rma rate of around 2 5 That's what I call high
You consider 1 in 1000 to be super high
People were right to be concerned given the information that was available at the time
i live in
This is true however an Nvidia subreddit is hardly going to be objective over Nvidia criticism Reddit especially on subs pertaining to huge corporations who offer consumer products is notoriously group think just how Twitter is often an echo chamber for people in agreement lamenting over everything
It is a problem because it reveals that the cables are poorly designed which makes user error more likely
keep in mind that this was the only way GN was able to recreate the melting scenario so this is the fact that they are preaching there will be outliers like manufacturing defects or pins pushed into the connector too much pressure on the connector breaking the solder from the there are also posts on this sub of people claiming the connector was fully seated and still had melted pins NVIDIA had their earnings report today so the silence may be broken
This is the first time that this specific plastic connector housing has been used It obviously requires additional insertion force verification of being properly inserted that prior connectors didn't
An audible click would help
Because people like you wouldn't have believed Nvidia and don't pretend you would have
The are potentially liable for whatever they say so gotta run it down and consider all aspects and
Sad we live in an age that people wont believe something until they see it on youtube until they see rigorous testing and the issue replicated FTFY
Your cablemod will melt too if you don't plug it in properly
If you also want a good looking and tidy cable on top of safety why not
I d cancel it
Where did you learn maths 0 1 of 100 000 is 100 Not 1000 0 1 of 100 000 0 001 x 100 000 100
100 is a little over 8 dozen That still constitutes dozens
Lmfao so off on the math here man
Manufacturer tolerance if usually around 0 1 it's within spec lol
Great input now see yourself out
Lol
Tell me you didn t watch the entire video without telling me you didn t watch the entire video
Lol
He mentioned it Any cable can fail under the right circumstances being Not fully seating it then bending the cable
The channel makes money off of the video
Any cable is capable of melting but some design flaws on the adapters make it more likely due to not compensating for user error Make sure the cable adapter or otherwise is fully inserted without being able to wriggle out and you're good
People not plugging it in all the way
Theres no mention about the cable being bent downwards Yes there is The entire chapter called Partial Insertion User Error talks about the issue that GN believes is the cause and Steve shows how you can apparently socket the connector thinking that it's done properly and that the cable routing you do in the case can then walk the connector out of the socket It's not SPECIFICALLY about the cable being bent in a particular direction but that moving the cable can result in the connector walking out of the socket when not fully and completely inserted
Everyone said it was fully inserted Some may have been cases of the foreign objects the video mentions but its far more likelly that people were simply intentionally or not full of shit
Use it to stop the rtx 4090 from sagging
It wasn't instock before launch either I put my name on the notify list a couple days after it launched
apparently they'll be shipping next week
They said it can cause issues if you keep checking it
You are 18 and the first PC you ever put your hands in our life is a 4090 with a new 16 pin connector Basically lack of experience explains the 0 1 figures
The click really isn't that loud If you insert slowly you can barely hear it at least that was the case for me But I was able to fell the click there was no mistaking that the clip has seated
20 20 hindsight is perfect but I had this thought after watching this video Nvidia might have figured out immediately through their vast number of knowledgeable engineers that it was user error However how do you put out a press release basically blaming the users without completely alienating all the potential customers Saying they don't know how to plug in the connector correctly simply won't go well I imagine the press and of course Reddit will eat Nvidia alive
Can you cancel the order
Buy a return ticket for him and I m sure he ll appreciate his uncle s generosity
Yes
Show us the picture of the hole through your case later
I did that recently and heard a really unnerving creak from I think my motherboard just thought I d share before you unleash your Herculean might upon it
You don t have to you can tell when it s completely in
Denied On what grounds Melted adapter is undeniable in an RMA
People are morons especially on social media
That was a sad event that 't post here often That says a lot about the Reddit community
Everyone who doubted Jonny Guru should be ashamed He is an expert among experts
they were attacking anyone that said anything other than hurrdurr nvidia bad make gpu go boom
Johnny also went off and threw a temper tantrum against GN when this all started I think that soured some people's opinions on 't aware of who JG was he's not quite as prolific as he was pre Corsair and cussing out Tech Jesus isn't a good way to make friends Of course that doesn't change that he's really knowledgable and generally knows his shit but he's not exactly the politest dude sometimes It's not all that surprising he gets the same in return
He was wrong about Nvidia's adapter restricting overclocking power limits if only 3 pins were in plugged in before that so it would make sense to doubt him Edit he didn't think the card could change power limits not that they could
JohnnyGURU basically surmised that the end user was an idiot The end user isn t any smarter or dumber than they were last gen While it seems that it can be caused by user error Johnny glossed over the fact that the adapter was poorly designed which lead to user error and cut straight to blaming the user
Because he didn't do anywhere near the same level of testing GN did here and basically concluded that it was user error without producing evidence that he managed to get even a single cable to fail GN actually did with an actual GPU thereby proving that theory Big difference
Did he also do electron microscopy and tomography of failed connectors while testing a bunch of other theories
Its not about saying but proving Hundred people hundred opinions someone will guess it you need evidence and scientific method to prove it though
I've been saying this same thing to people on here based on preliminary data but redditors love to circlejerk
Shouldn't take this forum too seriously tbh He's been pretty helpful to me outside of this forum
Well this is because people don't want to hear the user error argument especially without any proof it is way more fun to jump and say that nvidia is to blame for giving us bad adapter and that they have a design flaw in the card and that all 4090s are a bomb waiting to go off and burn your house down It's much harder to argue with GN since as mentioned here already they actually tested it and got it to melt on top of investigating and finding a lot of evidence to support their conclusion With that said nvidia are absolutely responsible for this while they did not design the 12vhpwr connector they did end up using it They should have made sure that the cards can't work if not plugged in somewhat correctly
Funny how that works
Johnny had nothing to back his opinions up It s very different when you ve got evidence of your claims
Some do My adapter has a loud click when it's inserted It's the reason I know mine wasn't fully inserted when I installed mine I ran it for an hour before I gave it one last push and heard the click
Most of the adapters connectors probably do have the click The click is only audible reinforcement that the connection is locked If you can see or feel the latch is over the pin tab then the connection should be good If it's not clicking it's most likely not plugged in all the way you held on to the latch while inserting the connector and had some level of seesaw so the latch goes over the pin notch rather than slide over it to click you're using a vertical thumb grip covering too much of the connector so it mutes the sound you're plugging in too slowly the latch pin is damaged or too smooth the material on the connector is too soft mushy and not rigid enough so it doesn't click etc but it most likely didn't click cause it wasn't plugged all the way in
Just imagine the SI's They have trouble making sure all the cables are in properly after it is shipped And this cable doesn't even have a lock into place tab
Peoples PC building habits didn t suddenly change the day the 4090 came out If there s such a spike in user error it points squarely to poor design
Or forgetting to take off the plastic film from the CPU cooler The worst that happens is unusually high temps Or if you tried putting an incompatible CPU into a socket It should physically prevent that Of course there have been cases of people taking a hammer to force it in but that's blatant user abuse at that point
No it's really not The poor installation of a CPU cooler does not imply permanent damage or at worst a fire Design needs to take safety and risk into account The more dangerous something is the more stupid proof it has to be These connectors run way too much power to not even have a properly engineered hook click
I used to build several dozen computers a month and I can't imagine a universe where the 8pin or molex connector was this sensitive It's not designed with enough safety factor imo This is a card that will likely trade hands 3 4 times get included in oem builds etc We will just continue to see this happening without a change In your example if I don't cool my CPU well it won't result in literal 't have this problem with the older connector
I think user error is something no manufacturer can stop Good design can make user error far less likely though
I think user error is something no manufacturer can stop And if users keep checking their connectors they will scrap off the coating creating foreign debris The manufacturer can easily stop this particular error by adding a detection mechanism to see if the connector is improperly seated Gamer's nexus said himself this should be relatively simple to do then have the card simply refuse to turn on if an improper contact is detected For example they could achieve this by having 1 one of the pins be a bit shorter in length than the others in doing so unless the card is fully seated it would be impossible for that pin to make proper contact so if the card doesn't detect power coming into that particular pin refuse to boot
Now that you mention it we may actually need to make this a code
rolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughing
It could be fixed by having the cable lock in or have the sense pins shorten so it isn't possible for it to run if it isn't fully connected
Being large and having many pins isn't an issue Motherboard power connectors are larger and have more pins yet don't have this issue The current trough the tiny pins is also not the issue the connectors have been tested to handle well over 1000W just fine GN also tested cutting off 4 of the 6 12V pins and drawing 600W trough those making each of the 12V pins handle about 3 times their rated current and they found no significant heating of the connector The lack of an audible click or other kind of feedback seems to be the main problem GN showed that it's possible for a cable to look and feel like it's fully inserted while it actually isn't fully latched and can wiggle out which is something that really shouldn't happen on such a high power connector When the fault happens it also seemed to cause a runaway thermal effect that melts the adapter and even causes smoke within minutes while people with burnt connectors don't usually mention it happening so quickly This makes me think that in most cases the connector was probably inserted far enough to look fully inserted or at least feel tight but not latched Then it slowly wiggled loose over time due to vibrations and or thermal cycles which can easily happen if there's tension on at least one of the cables I've seen similar problems in cheap SATA cables where they can look and feel correctly plugged in but eventually come loose because they didn't fully latch Luckily though SATA cables carry much less power so a bad connection doesn't generate enough heat to melt the connector It just makes the drive it was connected to unavailable until you plug it back in
The only aspect of the design that is concerning is the peeling tin that exposes the copper after multiple removals and insertions not the connector itself If you need an audible click to insert connectors properly instead of checking the insertion and double checking your build then you shouldn't be building a computer PERIOD
That would ultimately be caused by user error though it's the users job to make sure that their card fits into their case properly Like making sure your e atx motherboard fits into your case for example

Overreacting by doing what the consumer wants
We were active on Reddit before the 4090 was even out Being present in the community is part of our identity
Simply the best tester of tech products on YouTube by a country mile Obviously everyone makes mistakes but GN usually apologises very quickly if they do mess up and they're incredibly thorough in the first place so it's pretty rare Without them I don't know where we would be as consumers Hats off to them
of course a bunch of angry redditors turn out to be incorrect it s almost completely user error from a small percentage of not so careful people humans are prideful and unwilling to admit they may be the problem even more so after they shell out 2k and feel they deserve better lmao this subreddit was pointing fingers HARD at nvidia lo and behold it s the inexperienced user that is mostly at fault here not a multi billion dollar corporation that knows better than to release something that could explode even when it IS seated properly when seated properly they are all fine that s why the recent reminder from nvidia was almost solely focused on making sure your connecter was fully seated and clicked in i think this sub is eating it s words rn v ig2px7ofKhQ t 1382s in case you need the link again watch from 25 16 he SPECIFICALLY addresses that paranoia and wanting to continually check the adapter is one of the primary causes of failure because doing that is one of the easiest ways to introduce foreign debris from it chafing off from the side as you slide it in and out i understand you may be paranoid and want to check but understand that doing so ANY number of times will increase the likelihood of failure straight from GN s mouth
Mine only clicked the first time I've checked the connector 3 times and it hasn't clicked since I've made sure it's jammed in there super hard until my fingers hurt Piece of shit connector
i installed my 4090 this monday It's a FE i heard a loud audible click with the 4 8pin adapter
Yeah if it's user error it's an error I wouldn't hold against anyone and that includes even experience PC builders When you insert a stick of ram or pull down the retention arm on an LGA CPU there's a tactile feel to it you know when you've got it seated properly vs not Other power connections are similarly tactile Watching the clip in this video of GN wiggling the connector down into place where plastic touched plastic but then BEING ABLE TO PULL IT BACK OUT isn't something that should be possible and is bad design Nvidia didn't invent this connector they just decided to use what should be the newest standard Also one thing to consider is how many people had their 3090's crashing or worse having their cheap PSU cables melt because they couldn't supply enough power from the 3x8 pin connectors due to using a daisy chain and not reading the directions If Nvidia had gone with a 4x8pin design instead of the 12VHPWR how many more people would we see complaining about that issue on reddit
A regular 6pin or 8pin power connector doesn't 'click' where are you hearing these clicks
I went and tried my adapter that came with my gigabyte 4090 windforce It goes in east with a very audible and tactile click
both of my cables 3x8 nvidia adapter and cable mod 4x8 to 12vhpwr cable clicked and it was pretty noticable
In another post on this topic days ago I replied to the OP that had a melted cable offering my opinion that it s possible that the cable had debris surrounding the metal contacts or was created when inserted exactly what GN says can happen and that maybe the debris caused it to not be fully inserted because OP was adamant it was inserted fully I was actually being downvoted and I couldn t believe So the one theory I was most in agreement with turns out to be 100 accurate I wish I could find every single idiot that downvoted me and make them suck on a melted adapter LOL
Lmao the miserable pocket watchers were so happy cant wait untill it burns your house down hahaha im so happy with my 1050ti
If you go through the Mega thread there are a lot of obvious ones but I'm sure a vast majority of them were due to user error and weak hands x200B width 1952 format png auto webp v enabled s 1678863fa030c848d7a82eaa0b72565e31e687aa
pcmasterrace has been probably the worst sub for perpetuating this absurd idea that everyone with a 4090 is going to have it melt before their eyes That sub is pure cancer and everyone there seems to have a fit when they see anyone with high end hardware Ironic given the subs name lol
so nvidia needs their version of NACS PCI SIG
The redesign for the female plug side by amphenol looks to solve this by making the sense pins not contact enough to power the card if it is indeed not plugged in enough
Nvidia could have gone with less pins with better quality couplers for the same price per cable You are describing the old non standard 12pin NVIDIA used on the RTX 30 series
Their findings said extreme user error and repeatedly called out inexperienced users in a way that was clear he was being very careful with his words It's not just that the connector is a smidge
The debris point was a very small minority The findings was that the vast majority of failures are user error Majority of the 0 05 0 1
one in 1500 is not common moron that s only like 133 cards of the 200k they have shipped honestly not bad when you consider consumer product failure rates and NO no one s house has burned down
NACS yeah i'm gonna listen to a fucking elon musk shill on anything technical lmfao
1 1000 1 2000 Even a one in two thousand chance seems high
Most of the cables melted pretty early on I get the caution and anxiety for other cables eventually melting but it seems like once that cable is in there properly with no debris like for most people who just install a GPU and leave everything as is until they get a replacement and nothing melted you should have nothing to worry about over the long term
Yeah did my cablemod last night and it was smooth in with a nice loud click My original adapter never melted since launch day but also never ever clicked There's a huge gulf in quality
Yep my CableMod 12VHPWR cable was super easy to insert
That said manufacturing defect rates are usually in parts per million when you're looking at a single component causing a defect rate that might be measured at the part per thousand level that's a big oof
B but bbutt but 4 every one posted here theirs a millions unposted by newbz Most people's don't post major issues with expensive products on intwerwebs Hole city blocks are in flames fire cuz of deez Herp derp average r nvidia poster
I m sure Nvidia has already done this but think it s such a small issue that it wasn t worth any potential legal issues that they won t say anything definitive
Maybe they did please insert your GPU cable fully until you hear a click its an user error It won't look good if any company makes such statement you know
The RTX 4080 is the only other card that has the 12V HPWR cable and that was released on let's see November 15 Yesterday The only cards that are in the hands of consumers are RTX 4090s
At 1 in 1000 I absolutely still think it should be recalled
I mean Steve with the help of his contact at the failure analysis lab testing did the job for Nvidia PCI SIG whoever Steve's contact had A LOT of in depth knowledge about the materials being used and how to diagnose the x rays of the failed adapters Why did it need to be Steve who reached out to this contact instead of the companies with Billions of dollars in profit that should be responsible for informing it's customers of potential issues of the product it designed
t 212 Nvidia board partners viewers cable manufacturers
It's also so far meaning it could go up as time goes on with usage
Just make sure it is seated and secured properly Won t have any issues if you do
yet here we are Also there's a comment here that proves a few of the ones posted tot this reddit and others are in fact User error as you can see it clear in the pictures
100 I wanted a white braided cable to match my system Cablemod makes by far the highest quality looking cable on the market Very happy with my purchase Would honestly recommend people getting one regardless Especially if you already dropped so much cash on the 4090
May also avoid poor manufacturing and foreign object debris so why not buy from Cablemod
Their marketing guy was working overtime But it was such a bindshot to buy them when the cause was so unclear I was just waiting for one of their overpriced boutique cables to melt and enjoy the fallout lol
Nah I think most people would prefer having a custom cable over that octopus monstrosity adapter in their case
Even if my adapter is safe I'll much prefer the cablemod cable It's just more elegant and doesn't cause a mess inside the PC
This right here I tried installing mine with the adapter and when I saw I had to do serious rerouting to not force the adapter to be strained I said screw it I'll wait for the cable It's much easier to mess this up with the bulkier adapter On top of that and while I don't have the cable to confirm yet other users have mentioned they can more easily hear an audible click which makes it easier to understand if it's properly inserted
If they just made sure it was clipped then there won t be any loose connectors Lol
So we're going to let any vendor shill their products in here endlessly Or just specific ones
Same
Thanks for the nice feedback and for the support
I have a post where I doubted his findings and got 10 down votes in a few minutes I even backed it up by a bunch of other statements ongoing test from PCI SIG etc Igor is unreliable but people will forget when the 50 series comes out and he brings about his next theory
I've red his articles from time to time and always felt he's a solid and competent guy That was until I found him on YT I am German and he doesn't come across as professional or somebody I would take serious It seems to me is guning for attention and dramatizes way too much
One great example of how lazy he is He and GN both got the same EVGA 4090 card I know because both videos showed the card and in both videos the same bend on one of the fins Jay did some lame ass video on it with not much substance while GN did a full review including a teardown and board analysis
cablemod shilling was nauseating for real they were like a rabid animal searching for scraps in every thread
He panders to fearful idiots It's objectively trash content and a trash situation tbh
He is also good at drilling PCB
Funny that how a manufacturer who actually built the fuckin things might know better than a forum full of idiots hammering at their keyboards
It was a cute graphic
I dont know if people were doubting it just it seemed arrogant and still does to put that out when a firm conclusion to the melting cables had not been established We already knew that an incorrect insertion could cause a melt the question was is this the main issue followed by who is to blame
What msi graphic
msi graphic got a link to that
The MSI one showed the PSU end
That's what she said
So those are faulty units quality control issue
Bunch of morons who can spend 2k on a card but can't push in a connector Can't fix stupid and sadly Nvidia is not to blame for this We all wanted to blame Nvidia but the reality is it was mainly user error
Ok Still an overlook on Nvidia's part It should be just about impossible to plug something like this in 've never had issues with people plugging 8 pins in wrong until now
I really enjoyed his modding vidz especially with 's been kind of phoning it in
I think thats to harsh I would put him as a professional redditor he is like a decent aggregate of info for people that don't want all the details of a GN
Still one of the biggest channels And he volunteered to test the melting in regular user conditions Though it may be irrelevant now he didn t just talk about it and moved on Effectively he kept the discussion going and it s great
Yeah I remember when Jay content was 'm still subbed to his channel but can't remember the last time I clicked on a video it is all just the lowest effort bullshit
I am all for the locking tab style that we use in heavy machinery planes some automotive Only when it is fully inserted a tab non removable will allow you to fully slide in and lock the connector in place No pushing or grinding the plastic connector into place looking at your usb 3 0 connector Of course it is ridiculous overkill for a stationary electronics it is designed to be in mobile equipment It only exists mainly for modules or control units so the plug can be reused infinite amounts of but when a graphics card is 1600 usd it is like a single module in price and probably could justify the cost
If you make an idiot proof connector they're going to make a better idiot I think by the time we're at 1kW GPUs will require an electrician license to install
Their revision looks to focus on the sense pins not seating unless the connector is plugged in well Resulting in a GPU that simply turns off or won't power on at all
This is the best summary
The favorite design flaw is you are using it wrong
Well people will start panicking after seeing new cases every day and not knowing for a fact what causes it
absolutely
a self fulfilling prophecy
user error but not neccessarily dumb alot of people's 12vhpwr connectors don't click so it probably confuses some people
Hold on So the whole issue has been dumb users all the time If enough dumb users make the same mistake then it is a design flaw Just the way she goes
Kinda yeah There's undoubtedly a problem with the design of the cable insofar as it should be more clear when it's properly inserted or not BUT as they say in the video even improperly inserted cables with a millimeter or so of gap weren't failing In fact it seems like t 1131 they found that in many cases the cables that failed had like 4mm of gap which they could tell from markings on the damaged cables That's some pretty egregious user error and IMO at a certain point we should expect people shelling out nearly 2 grand for a piece of hardware to have the due diligence to properly push the cable in lol
Some will be from forgien object in the connector ether from manufacturing inserting or user addition Basically dirt from manufacturing But most will be from people not pushing the connector in until it clicks and then the connector starts walking back from cable management and fan vibrations I mean considering how common it is for the EPS connector to not be fully seated from custom build sites this is a huge issue for the connector since any not fully seated cable with a bend will burn eventually
yep and now it s backed by DATA
I watched some of J2Cs videos on this when they came out and I couldn't for the life of me understand why he thought they were good to upload He literally disproved Igor's theory about the soldering through testing then brushed it off and concluded that it was correct anyway I was so confused
My brother met Jay at a supermarket in LA and he was rude to him Goes to show
If you couldn't fully seat the 24 pin connector on your motherboard would you still use it or would you try to get a replacement cable I know that the GPUs cost a lot of money and anyone who buys one probably isn't the most patient type but if something is obviously wrong maybe don't use it
I like being poor
I liked the locking minifit they used to be I thought it was very minimally problematic The split from 6 8 pin was annoying but seemed great for minimizing user error Their effort was to reduce touch points and size impact to the PCB
I'd guess you're right about cost USB C is a form factor but also a controlled standard It has tolerances and pinouts you must adhere to in order to use the name The style of connector also requires a process called overmolding The connector housing is made of plastic or similar and is molded over the metal contacts shielding And touching on shielding that's another aspect of USB that might not be necessary in powering a graphics card but is required by USB standard If you had to plug in 2 or 3 or 4 USB cables I can imagine that being very expensive Not to mention there is no physical retention mechanism and might not even be permitted by the relevant safety committee I'm not sure if UL has a role in computers graphics cards ATX standards
Check out the mouse mat too I have one from the first batch and it's still in perfect condition
I like LTTs perspective on merch People throw money at superchats and GN has a Patreon and I give them some through that But I think I'll just move my donation to an equivalently sized less regular merch purchase
They are not selling merch as companies do Merch is a way for YouTubers to support their channels That's why they cost so much Use your brain man
If it's not inserted correctly designed so that it's easy to be inserted incorrectly without knowing it and designed so that it will still continue to transmit power when that occurs
They've been sniffing around this sub like flies on shit since the issues started It's kinda gross and has put me off them as a company tbh
Eh it still looks 1000x better than the stock adapters
Is it latched not did you hear it click but is it latched If so then you know it's good if not then you know it's not fully in regardless if it feels as far as you could get it to go The end of the video has a good visual demo of how to check if it's properly latched without relying on sound feedback during insertion
No that's not what it seems like At least not if you paid attention In the chapter Partial Insertion User Error v ig2px7ofKhQ t 1070s Steve shows how the connector can be apparently fully inserted and then walk itself out due to cable strain The 2 mm gap they see on the partially melted cable or specifically the marks that show only 4 mm of the 6 mm connectors are engaged is a likely result of this type of error And as Steve points out right after showing the faulty insertion is that the cables don't really click which is part of the design oversight Now combine an enormously tall card with an enormously tall connector with a normal sized case and the cable strain can probably happen just from putting the side panel on It's a user error but it's also a design error
A tiny bit incorrectly could still do you in over time Vibration from case fans desk slams walking plus the fact that any connector is going to be under tension simple from gravity unless cablemanaged to NASA standards could easily turn a wrong but fine connection to melty over a few weeks or months
Reddit got really butthurt the last time a company said they'd no longer provide free GPUs after unfair coverage
I wouldnt use Dieletric grease If you had to RMA the manufacturer will reject it based on putting grease onto your connector
You could but then that's going to introduce a foreign substance that will remain on the contacts and even potentially prevent proper mating between the contacts between the cable and the socket itself if it gets into the terminals IPA won't do that
when it can unseat the cable Have there been proven cases of fully seated cables unseating themselves The cables still have retention clips
That's not manufacturing error that is poor design Works as intended if used correctly but goes very wrong very quickly if it meets a certain failure mode
This was not easy to occur though Think about how many hoops they had to jump through to get these results
Exactly Either you design around how a common person would use it or you include an assload of warning labels instructions This is still entirely on shitty design quality The old 8 pins were fucking fine Everybody seemed to know how to use them
Since he gave the stats if you have watched in the video of the failure rate it s not very common at all
From the video it was not that easy to make it fail even with it not seated entirely It took a certain level of poor insertion for it to finally fail
But you should always pull it to see if it is latched in Just a bit of a tug and wiggle If it comes back out you didn't have it seated
For now GN s video shows that the cables have issues with degradation that can lead to the melting In addition to the number of people who may have had it happen and never reported it But the degradation should be concerning for everyone
This is exactly the criticism by Steve that his peers jump to conclusions and bend the discourse in a way that even when the truth comes out the taint remains there And hey as long as it's not AMD it's all the better to take a dump on a brand
I used to design connectors and 1 is not an acceptable failure rate and the design is very obviously deficient from a feedback perspective
Which still means that the design of the connector needs to be better Relying on magnifying lense visual and audio cues for actually being properly connected is an issue with the design I don't know about others but compared to most PC connectors the 12VHPWR connector on my 4090 was extremely tight to even push in completely and I had to really look carefully to make sure there were no gaps That's just bad design There is also no real need for this connector to be as small as it is either Give it bigger pins with more room to push the connector in easily so user error is much harder to cause
OEM of what Acceptable failure rates are entirely situational 0 05 of your 200M products catch on fire in someone s pocket Very extremely mega bad 0 05 of your 100 sales per year have slightly out of spec colors Sure whatever For a company like Nvidia and a product like this a 0 1 failure rate for this specific failure is atrocious Fair enough that the primary cause seems to be user error but that s kind of Nvidia s problem too User experience is part of the design process
Ahhh molex that connector that will short itself on a corner of a drive cradle if left dangling in a case lol
My dumb engineer ass thinks that the 4 sense cables should not connect unless the connector is Atleast so much in That would avoid the current flow unless the cable is properly inserted Wt do you think
To be fair if Nvidia issued a statement saying it was user error people would have lost their shit They needed a reputable third party to make the assessment to avoid backlash for telling the truth I wouldn't doubt it if they came to the same conclusion but decided to stay quiet because what that conclusion was and the potential perception of them saying it's user error Let's all be honest we all would've thought Nvidia was bullshitting if they said the same exact thing so makes sense for them to stay quiet
Legally I doubt they will ever Anything they say is ammo for a lawsuit
Like some prebuilt PC manufacturers super glue cables into their ports because if they come loose during shipping the whole PC won't boot This is 100 a design flaw Yes user error is causing it but the design has to account for it Just wait for OEMs like Dell and HP to start shipping out the 4000 series in bulk without changes to the connector You're going to end up seeing more failures from non tech salvy people The failures we're seeing now is miniscule compared to the future when the rest of the 4000 series line up comes out and its widely available in pre builts from OEMs and SIs
People that bought 4090 and able to report burning adapter earlier on aren't the average user fe was sold out within seconds other popular skews are gone within the hour at best MSI watercooled one was gone within sec it went up as well These people knew what they were getting and when so its not a mystery that this specific group of user will report to forums they aren't your average rich user that just had money they are your rich user with product knowledge and the drive to camp out these cards I myself got 3 different cable modiy cablemod amazon w e since the product launch Decided to not use them and instead just rock the nvidia cable in the worst case that it may burns up i moved it to a 13900k 4090 build that is not used for work and put a metal tray below the case so if it does fail i can just RMA everything
If so many of these issues are being compounded and creating a fire hazard in people's homes it'd feel weird to me to attribute it to user error like it's being done If an average user is far more prone to make a mistake when connecting this cable adapter compared to regular ones is that not bad design
I agree with what you are saying but then again is that higher failure rate just 0 05 to 0 1 Because that sounds like such an extremely rare occurrance that we would hardly hear of it To me this sounds a lot like the Samsung Note 7 debacle It was also said to be a super rare occurrance and yet it was so much higher than in other phones and it was such a serious issue that it had to be banned and recalled
Lmao
I m curious too now lol
Excuse me a what
Yea so easy that only like 5 out of 10000 people do it This sub has made people deluded about the entire concept of reasonable
Stop drinking and log off lol
That really sucks that you have been holding out I hope you get your card soon I've been enjoying the hell out of my 4090 FE
Ill try wiggling it once I get home and see if it has any play
no one paid attention because FTFY Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didn't help you it is only correct in Nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant The deck is yet to be payed Payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them The rope is payed out You can pull now Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment Beep boop I'm a bot
Okay and what happens if my card catches fire after I do that You can't prove that it won't we have a megathread of burned cards And it didnt happen with any other cards Again I'm actually thinking about buying one here like no way I'm spending 1600 on this I'm gonna need a lot more than GN says it's okay for me to part with that kind of money
mods on some cough mod of 4 subs
Thanks No point in buying cablemod then
Yes so stupid And also calling this user error only because a user did something wrong doesn't mean that it is actually user error This error can happen way to often to be user error It is bad design that allows the user to do something wrong
There is an issue People complain about the issue and ask for it to be resolved When the issue is resolved workaround is finally found people stop talking about the issue I'm not sure what you want to happen People to keep complaining for no reason after the fact or people to ignore issues without a solution
The problem here is not the failure rate only it s the failure rate over time 0 05 01 over 3 weeks or so is quite problematic And it assumes that all cases of melting have been found I won t be surprised if many impacted people don t know So the question is the in a year For me the risk of burning down the house even if only 0 1 is too high considering the benefit is really good graphics If turns out that it really is only about forcing it in till it clicks I would feel better buying one but this has too much smoke around it to assume the fire isn t there at all Especially when considering that other companies like Ford have previously hidden defects that they predicted would kill because they forecasted that paying out the death claims was cheaper than a recall I d like to think that Nvidia wouldn t do that but I don t want to be proven wrong after the house burns down
Just the usual shit New gen of cards comes out invariably something goes wrong with a tiny portion of them people assume it's a widespread problem and cry for recall and attack the developer turns out it's nothing goes quiet Repeat a couple of years later Yeah like the 3070 exploding disaster or the 2080 super VRAM frying or the Titan X snapping the PCIe lane did I miss an entire year's worth of controversy What the hell other recent GPU generation had some claimed widespread issue that had people attacking nvidia or amd and demand recalls The closest I can remember is new world's capacitor issue but that was a genuine problem that bricked
What happens to those that are plugging it in correctly but FOBs inside the connector or inside the plastic housing itself are causing issues EDIT Alright deleted NVIDIA flaired account that'
Means bad design We all used molex 4 pins 6 pins 8 pins satas for ages There wasnt even a 0 00000001 fail rate Bad
When people get a bit too fanatical in their fandom they start seeing everything as a competition with their chosen star as the competitor of everyone else and competitors are the ENEMY and must be denigrated at every possible time This applies to sport music entertainment in general and like it or not TechTubers are entertainment politics and so on Keep this in mind and it will explain a LOT of shit
People enjoy dunking on Linus Even if he fucks up from time to time from everything we know over the years he's a respectable guy and a good employer Him shilling his merch pays for big staff he has It seems like people have especially started hating on him after he called using adblocks a piracy on YouTube and that YouTube has the right to charge for 4K he explains his stance pretty well in both cases Those two events seems to have pissed off the Reddit the most although it doesn't seem to have any effect on the number of views LMG videos get
I m shocked they didn t make merch mocking this tbh Order our new LTT Flame On hoodie featuring NVIDIA failure green This hoodie is as hot as their adapters
The reddit overreaction was the hissy fit about a tiny handful of posts about this issue existing to begin with And the judge wouldnt ever get to watching this video either because nobody would ever consider the insanity of a class action over a 0 05 product failure rate
Where Got mine for 1600 plus tax
What a dumb comment
Impossible
they posted pictures and it was clearly shown its not bent nor unseated I love GN and appreciate all the work they have done and in no way my comment was to debunk them or saying what they said is false
You can always plug in the adapter first before slotting the GPU on the motherboard no
Apparently we did not since you didnt seem to get the part that the FOBs are only a possible problem and only accounts for a tiny portion of the cases at best
Thnx that is another way to look at it I just realised if you have a small case and the sidepannel puts to much pressure on the 12vhpwr cable It will probably move itself out
Some cables being easier to plug in then others doesn't necessarily mean bad design but awful manufacturing processes I didn't have any problems at all with my cable but Nvidia definitely cheaped out with production if the margins of error are so large
For an electrical failure like this absolutely That's going to be thousands and thousands of GPUs over the entire series using this connector
Concerned of possible risks maybe but this was clearly hysteria
There was a video 2 weeks ago from aib worker from Galax got it to 110c d psu at corsair and everyone blasted him
That's natural selection at play
Or a sense cable that has a shorter pin than the rest and requires a full connection before allowing power delivery
How to plug it in properly D
Hahaha you are right I was too sleepy when I typed that Got it all wrong I edited my comment Thanks
I'm not the one rushing through installation of a 1600 dollar component and half assing it
Tell me you don t understand sarcasm without telling me
Thank you for this darling This is confusing though don't these new cables have a 'click' on insertion
lol Thanks X
That was my thought Nvidia pushed out a new connector then blames the users for them melting It would really look like Nvidia trying to shift the blame and be horrible PR with the whole 4080 12 16 fiasco and the pricing I'd assume Nvidia has known for awhile now and was just going to scapegoat suppliers and then quietly say oh and year make sure it's plugged in all the way too
Yeah probably can it s been processing for two weeks now Probably won t see it till mid December if I m lucky Still the adapter looks pretty awkward so I ll probably just go through with it for the looks
Oh yeah baby use me like a 24 pin connector
So maybe it would be better to plug the cable into the card before seating it into the motherboard
To be clear My adapter didn't melt The plastic locking tab broke off the 12vhpwr port the very first time I plugged the adapter in The result is that no cable can securely seat in the port greatly increasing the likelihood of it melting My RMA was denied because it was deemed physical damage caused by the user
Reddit is a shit hole but it has its uses
I don't want to get into the whole thing with Johnny it makes me very sad But I will say GamersNexus came through with testing and tell proven ways of failure Everyone else was just doing guess work educated guess work And Johnny put in a lot of time and I respect that But it's so much harder to argue with someone with they can point to the smoking gun
He even deleted his account after all the armchair engineers here telling him he was wrong
Most redditors are low income mentally ill crab bucket mentality pieces of trash That's why mainstream subs are garbage and if you find yourself on the opposite side of an issue to reddit you're probably in the right
Let's just say my username is very much so specific to where it exists
He was already on thin ice on reddit because of his attack on gamers nexus
I mean if you leave the cable unseated enough to have this problem then you're at the very least not very careful with your 1600 GPU
So that's how you spell those words Thank you
They re redesigning the plug to have shorter sense pins so it doesn t detect them unless it is fully seated in the connector
this cable doesn't even have a lock into place tab It definitely does but just like the connector itself it is small and delicate People are expecting that 8 pin click which could be compared to snapping your fingers and this thing clicks like you're licking your lips
Or if you tried putting an incompatible CPU into a socket It should physically prevent that I'm guilty of this I just assumed if it was the same socket type it would be compatible so I chose a motherboard cpu combo based on an LGA1151 socket when I should have been looking at Z390 or whatever
Ya this is true It is a shit design and unfortunately a lot of people who are interested in pc building can possibly have a very bad experience
100 It s stupid that stupid people are blaming nvidia for them not actually ensuring their connectors are seated properly It s basically power wiring 101 But the reality with engineering products is that they need to be designed in a way that the dumbest people are not able to screw it up The connector should have been adjusted to account for failure to fully seat it in
Pretty sad it s just mods who get to post
main jannie Man that takes me back It was also hilarious
Nestl Username checks out
Funny how the comments for that thread is locked to prevent any discussions on Reddit about that new rule
Consumer want safe 4090 They're wasting money on wrong solutions and then providing false sense of security
Also not quick for pour fuel on the fire and causing more panic without having more info I think Steve has an actual journalism background vs everyone else just being youtube personalities and it shows
I dunno the connector quality is clearly shit and it's not always easy for users to tell when it's 100 plugged in For example I only got the click the first time I installed I've checked for melting 2 times now and the click no longer happens no matter how hard I push If 3 cycles are enough to deform the plastic to the point where the click doesn't occur the quality is shit Definitely just leaving mine plugged in from now on I feel a little more secure Since u Low Air6104 blocked me for some reason I'm posting the final reply here I don't know how to convince you that 3 connection cycles on a product should not be anywhere near enough to degrade the connector to the point of melting And I actually framed this wrong I checked for melting only twice but that means 3 cycles total This is not excessive People should be able to buy a GPU and install it wherever they want Migrate it to another PC Test it on test benches Multiple times without the fear of their 1600 product MELTING You understand that the connector is officially rated for 30 cycles right And you're giving me shit for 3 Get outta here I'm returning to this saga because u Low Air6104 unblocked me just to send me this message and block me again lol youre an idiot hey you might want to check out the latest post on the nvidia sub you were dead wrong jump straight to the comments and weep lol Dead wrong about what exactly Little bitch baby come back and unblock me so we can talk This is no way to communicate
The sub is not a hivemind and some posts were correct The cable shouldn't be that difficult to properly insert This is still a design flaw If it wasn't a design flaw we wouldn't be here in the first place
I wouldn't call those user error scenarios not so careful It's actually more likely from users with little to no experience building connecting assembling PC hardware that could think more force could damage it or think it's fully seated after just a tiny bit of force So it's probably because they were too careful in the first place
The people who didn't understand why waiting for actual data was important aren't intelligent mature enough to admit they were wrong
You are generalizing here I have 2 4090s with melted cable On both occasions I used a ton of force and was careful not to bend the cable The first one never clicked but the second one clicked and still melted slightly on the 3rd top pin Also second one can t click anymore after slightly melting As GN mentioned it s not always user error the cause and there is some manufacturing and design fault there too
Especially the ones shaming people for buying a 4090 during the height of these issues I was one of the ones shamed for owning not only an FE and talked shit to via PM cause of my choice but for also buying an MSI MEG Ai1300 PCI5 PSU Im still enjoying both of my purchases and MW2 never looked better Eat my ass the whole lot of you
You're not wrong I try and approach these kinds of thing with logic and as much evidence as can be found Sadly that has no place here generally
Still points to a design flaw if an apparently seated cable could cause a fire It s as bad as apples you re holding it wrong BS but with actual lives at stake
did you watch the video the pins can scrape when you insert properly creating a lead into the failure the tin gets scraped off the copper which allows for resistance from oxidization that causes the failure from normal insertion this is a rushed design that should have been shaken down before it got into consumer hands
I got downvoted hard for suggesting it might be mostly user error because I myself made a mistake with similar result with my 3090 used a 24 pin cable comb on three 8 pin cables causing strain and ultimately slightly unseating of an eight pin
If 1 in 1000 users can't use your connector properly you made a shitty connector It's supposed to be idiot proof blaming idiots doesn't absolve the designer Edit And he's blocked another person who disagrees with him to get the last word
Block me too thin skinned kid pls don't cry crying face
If that many users are having the issue it isn't really human error as much as it's poor human factors engineering If your system requires normal individuals to interact with the system it needs to be designed in a way that makes the error difficult or impossible to do under normal circumstances by normal individuals A connector that doesn't offer a positive lock up or seat correctly can happen to anyone even experienced ICE techs sometimes cause issues with poor connectors that have to be reseated Doesn't matter if it's a hobby computer builder or chief ICE engr at a nuclear power plant when things don't work half the time it can be fixed by reseating or redoing connections Electrical things break at interfaces a lot There are also better connectors and methods of connection that could probably completely remedy or lower this failure rate
Give it two years and people will uncritically repeat the fact that the 4090 literally burned houses down as a talking point Edit for the people who apparently aren't getting it I'm mocking the people who talk about a risk of burning your house down
I wouldn't put it past some of these noobs that call themselves PC builders I've seen so much silly stuff over the years like backward fans cheap shitty parts with high end components no IO shield on MB installed the CPU wrong bent pins didn't install the RAM dimms correctly using the wrong set of connectors for their PSU type the list goes
Or you 't just blame users for a problem if it's happening to a lot of people at some point it's an oversight in the design
Claiming it is all on the users definitely isn't fair here There are clearly some design issues with the cable that are very likely getting fixed in future iterations This video even mentions things like how the cable doesn't click and it can be difficult to tell if it is fully inserted A few other creators all echoed this Molex to SATA cable fires were also most likely caused by the cable being a bit loose no one is claiming those cables were fine A cable where 1 in 2000 people insert it wrong and it becomes a fire hazard has some design issues that need fixed and will be phased out We have 4 6 and 8 pin cables that don't really have this problem because it is easier to tell when they are fully inserted Obviously reddit was being stupid trying to put 100 of the blame on Nvidia but you are being just as dumb here
Maybe stop checking it because you re more likely to introduce debris or wear the metal coatings
covnersly i've had many instances of no click on PCIe 8pin CPU 8 pin 24 pin i've built quite a few rigs with highly varied component choices this is basically down to manufacturing tolerances don't rely on audible clicks people
Yep I also very clearly heard a click when I installed my 4090 FE
Might be worth checking your
Uhhh all my cables click CPU 4 4 pin clicks ATX 24 pin clicks PCIe 6 2 clicks Obviously not like an MX blue or anything but there is definately an audible click accompanying the locking pin going down And as far as I understand they're supposed to That's the whole point of a SHARP bump rather than a round dimple both secure the connector but only the former produces a click Clicky switches use the same principle If yours don't click then you're definately an outlier and it may be a manufacturing defect if new or worn out cables or connectors if old the sharp click spot may be smoothed over time
Yes they do About the only ones that don't that I can think of are sata and molex
On my 6 and 8 pin connectors 850 rmx
6 and 8 pins absolutely click
The clips on the pins make the clicking sound
They definitely click This is a crazy comment You can even look at a 6 pin or 8 pin and see the component that is designed make the click
Mine click My CableMod 12VHPWR cable also clicks
Then you d be fine with the adapter if you chose to use it
Don t worry the most vocal never had a card that could have been affected therefore they were simply justifying their inability to own one They ll be far less happy now and exceptionally quiet
i imagine that this is actually where a lot of the sentiment came from envy
They literally opened with saying that if it's this easy for user error it's not a good design Which is just common sense Usability and safety are the two things any connector is designed for Otherwise you are just connecting wires together which can be done tons of ways Safety is the number 1 factor because a connector that melts isn't usable
Perhaps
A similar physical connector is on 3090Ti though no sensing pins
And we know exactly how many are in the wild It's a lot Nvidia did not produce a small number of 4090s my dude
3090ti has it and Intel s new server GPUs have it
How do you know they haven't already diagnosed the issue The fact that they haven't made any comment doesn't mean they didn't investigate and discover the issue You're right that they should have said something but that doesn't change the fact that properly seated plugs have a very low failure rate Everyone wanted this to be Nvidia's fault and it isn't My point was simply that people should wait for facts instead of making assumptions
Seems presumptuous Is there any evidence that their cables would be more or less susceptible
They can post and shill whatever they want idc im not a moderator
That's Reddit for you Someone could prove GN is wrong next week and the internet hivemind would downvote that too because that would require them to re evaluate their stance on a subject Reddit's voting system would be better off used as a contributes to discussion vs doesn't contribute to discussion thing but people use it as a popularity meter instead People are more likely to upvote a shitty meme generator pic over some thoughtful discussion or original content on a subject in pretty much any subreddit
What do you think are the odds of Jayz churning out a vid that simply summarizes GN's findings
My impression is in that video was he considered it a display museum item that he didn t want to risk damage to it by taking it apart I never got the impression that he intended to make a substantial video from it I do have issues with his cable videos though Those were sensational junk
of how lazy he is I mean Steve is 1000x better but JayZ also doesn't have a crazy lab like GN JayZ is more like Linus level technical too GN is for people who know their shit At least the more enthusiasts There's nothing wrong with saying I think this might be the problem but i'm not sure
I would argue they target different audiences
The same quality of internet investigation that went into Reddit finding out who the Boston bomber was
Agreed It's like the Poscap thing last gen All of a sudden everyone thought they were electrical engineers and cable experts Well here's what I think about all of lol Just stop
Tbf they have the same style graphic showing how to insert a GPU into a slot but the PCIe bus is on the wrong side So the illustration is 't display gpu side connections just PSU Was pretty sloppy
At least we now know that around 0 1 of people with too much money are too stupid to socket a cable correctly Yeah the design might be bad for not having tactile feedback but have those people tried looking or pulling at the connector Even GN couldn t believe in their initial testing that anyone would be stupid enough to leave it unsocketed for more than 1mm even with the bad feedback they were aware of So yeah my balls are in the 100 user error basket
Reddiors should say sorry to Nvidia too for trying to throw them under the bus Fuck we are a dumb bunch
Oh yes because corporations are so trustworthy and always honest
They might know better but they didn't have to create a meme about it I'm pretty sure that is why it got flamed like it did
it wasn't more or less arrogant than the other theories put out What made the loose connection theory harder to swallow is that the individuals might share some fault in their card's demise
And also still applies
Jay did not test it in regular conditions He also didn't know what he should have been looking for because he didn't have broken cables to examine and he couldn't reproduce the failure Like Igor Jay worked from an assumption about what was causing the failure and what he thought might be the cause Paul's Hardware also took apart the connector they had
He s not smart enough to actually provide useful information on the matter Just GN was smart enough to realize that professional assistance was needed to fully analyze and provide answers to the questions
I think Jay is still good content as an entry point into the PC building space Most of his videos have some useful information in them if you are legitimately starting on your PC building journey I think the fact that Jay is also kind of an every man also helps bring people in
He doesn't even add chapters to his videos that's how low effort he really is
I like the feature like you discuss sure costs go up but compared to a 1000 card I think it s easy to justify
Just not true These could have been designed to avoid these pin separation issues People have been building computers for 40 years with lots of standard connectors that still exist today None of them burned like this and in the 80s power draws for components like hds and floppies were higher than they were today Adrian's digital basement shows you how power hungry some of that stuff was The number of pins likely is the reason why the connectors are made so poorly If you need 12 pins instead of 6 you want to spend half as much on each pin It's just businesstrade mark It is telling that GN cut off all but 2 pins and it handled the full power load just fine There is no reason for these connectors to have all these pins It could have been a 4 pin connector with pins that cost 3 times the price per pin and coupler but better quality
If you make an idiot proof connector they're going to make a better idiot I guess you are sort of proving that with that logic Imagine not making cars safer because there is always a bigger idiot out there driving man shrugging
I think by the time we're at 1kW GPUs will require an electrician license to install You're gonna have to remove the outlet in the wall and just straight plug the GPU to youre house's live wires lmao
I ll reserve judgement until I can try and seat such a cable msyelf likely won t get the chance since I ll never own a 4090 but I would think there are other approaches such as plugging the 8 pins in directly into the GPU
If you make an idiot proof connector they're going to make a better idiot Or you'd just end up making a better product which is kind of the goal isn't it Why shouldn't a cable give solid feedback when it's seated correctly especially on a product you spend so much money on
My speculation yes but I think than not even 1 of who had the connector melted have checked if not hearing a click was normal they simply didn't pay attention like the ones that didn't fully inserted I had argued with one that was blaming NVIDIA and absolving himself from not pushing it fully in because the connector was impossible to be fully 't work as it should it means there is something wrong by ignoring that you take your own risks
Way of the road Bubs
And if 05 percent of them are doing it they are probably just dumb users
Jay knows that stoking hate for Nvidia will get him lots of views which means more ad revenue That's all he cares about
J2C mostly on crack
Why was your brother rude to Jay
Did you miss the part in the video where GN said that it is really hard to push in and that a lot of cables don't click The thing is that if it is hard to push in then I can also feel secure because it also feels hard to pull it out So you let it be this way but then you gets lose over time The Cable should not be hard to push in and it should either look definitely unplugged or definitely plug in correctly
I'm still not a fan of the minifit connectors personally I'm no expert but I've built a lot of 12v DC wiring harnesses and I've definitely seen a lot of standards that feel much sturdier in smaller form factors Honestly the form factor isn't even the biggest issue to me it's mainly ease of use I feel like even mini fit does not want to latch half the time unless your using entirely unnecessary amounts of force Also the 6 8 split is terrible but you can always buy better cables aftermarket so I'm just too lazy to do that so I can't complain
I bought both sets and they are fantastic
That's not using your brain that's just a justification you're giving to something you support that's all It's still overpriced from any outside perspective
2mm is a lot there is no excuse for not seeing
With something with such high frailer rate I blame design more the user It shouldn't be able to walk it self out needs user error proof as much as possible
That's possible but I have used DEG on many connectors that may be exposed to the elements as well as battery terminals on cars for years and never had an issue Not sure if it may affect warranty that would be my largest concern
If someone THINKS the cable is secured and then attempts to clean up the slack for better cable management then at what point is is a design flaw when it can unseat the cable and allow for for a high resistance parallel connection to cause the melting Full quote is someone thinks it is properly secured properly seated When this happens the result is to burn up rather than to disconnect or power off the card Even Steve in the video twice talked about and showed a video where the cable can be erroneously presumed securely connected when it is not at 7 37 and 18 10 Also if a retention clip was to break or fail then what should the outcome of that failure be Most people would presume a disconnected power cable with a failure to post video rather than melted hardware
The old 8 pins were fucking fine Everybody seemed to know how to use them And they still melted like chocolate under the Death Valley sun when they had a problem
it is absolutely not entirely on shitty design quality when they all work fine when inserted properly in the video they showed that many of the failed adapters that people submitted showed that they still had 4mm left that needed to be inserted so not even close to seated 05 failure rate isn t bad that s within margin of error when you consider the amount of idiots out there
It absolutely is considering the potential severity of the defect 0 1 is 1 in 1000 For comparison the famous Note 7 had a failure rate of 24 in 1 Million according to Samsung
He gave the stats sure but while not a manufacturing error as the guy above you said it's certainly a design one Something that is so hard to correctly seat AND gives no audible click that it is is certainly a huge design flaw
0 1 is still way too high for potential failure and potential fire hazard If you're driving and 1 in every 1000 times you hop into your car it spontaneously melted there would be massive recalls from the NHTSA for that car model
peers wannabes
Funny you mention that As part of the update from Nvidia they specifically mentioned that PCI SIG is taking that as a step PCI SIG is revising the connector The currently planned changes will only affect the four Sense Pins but they are quite a real solution Due to the shortening of the contacts the sense pins only become contactable when the plug has been fully inserted this means that the graphics card will no longer start without the first two sense pins being assigned or recognized Only PCI SIG itself knows why this was not planned from the outset If in a second step the shape of the connector housings could be corrected by specifying beveled or chamfered edges a large part of the problems on the customer side would automatically disappear
Absolutely agree
People still quote Steve Jobs for a thing he never actually said in as many words You're holding it wrong
It would still be a user error but the root cause would be a bad design
just 0 05 to 0 1 Because that sounds like such an extremely rare occurrance that we would hardly hear of it Dude 0 1 failure rate means that one out of every thousand cards has an issue that causes permanent damage 1 1000 is not even close to what I would call extremely rare
Do you overclock your ram
MAYBE even 10 in 10 000 exploding head
I ll put it differently if you knew about the burning problem and insufficient insertion and you still didn t secure an adapter or a cable properly then you re a moron Otherwise if you didn t know about it and made a mistake it s not on you it s on the manufacturer Yes I know after all these shenanigans owners of 5090 6090 etc will thoroughly check the Internet searching for potential problems just to be safe but this time it s only on the user if the user knew about potential problems
You were right I didn t have to wait long Literally just saw an Aorus Master in stock came in with the 4080s and snapped it up grinning facegrinning face
Can we stop wiggling stuff
Good bot
This has absolutely happened with other cards though it just didn't get the publicity this did Hell there was a post a day ago about a 3080 having this happen Melting connectors on cards has been a thing for a long ass time it just an extremely rare occurrence that requires multiple things to go wrong It just so happens that in this case it seems a little harder to tell if the cables are plugged in all the way and since one happened like the first day they were released we had a lot of people checking every day increasing the chance that they would end up improperly plugged in at some point The hysteria over the issue is making it worse not better and dooming and glooming about a 0 05 0 1 failure rate is ridiculous
GN didn t just say it s okay he had literal lab equipment and outside failure analysts verify the findings He was also able to reproduce the failures multiple times under almost the exact same conditions Safe to say if you want one buy it and plug the fucking connector in all the way If you are a mongoloid and doubt your ability to plug a connector in all the way then I definitely recommend not buying one
This is a scientific test what he stated was observed behavior under strict conditions Then he came to logical conclusions based on his observations and said conclusions strongly pointed to user error
You can't just create hypothetical catastrophes and demand they be fixed Unless theres proof that a fully connected card will melt how can you expect a nonexistent issue to be solved
If your cable is fully seated and you're not having issues with it then no unless you want a quality cable that has great aesthetics to pair Our cables have a nice and noticeable click though so you shouldn't experience that with our cables
They are still great cables and well built They also look awesome and can be custom lengths as well
User error should leave you with an unpowered GPU that doesn't display power on properly that's the bare minimum we need How the situation will look in 6 months to 1 year remains to be seen Will it be user error then as well To not get a debri free gold properly plated cable It just screams low quality low margins
nothing Its ones not plugging in thats had the issues its plain as day
My biggest issue with the cards is the price being so high but i can imagine the resell value later on will be garbage coz of a used up
You shouldnt have to explain the stance that adblock is piracy It extremely clearly is I do it too but I don t have any notions of righteousness I just hate ads
I'm surprised none of the tech tubers have been sponsoring FTX that I've seen They'd be getting crucified right now
0 05 to 0 1 so up to 1 in 1000 Products have been recalled with lower failure rates At least in the U S people can very much sue even if the success rate is low if the harm is big enough a potential fire is big enough You also don't need to downvote Don't make this a personal issue You're not nvidia
We don't know how many of the adaptors that have this shitty quality tho
And you apparently didn't watch the entire thing Steve makes a very good case for why it's more than just user error specifically calling out that it's a potential design oversight Go rewatch the Partial Insertion User Error chapter
That's 100 failures out of 100 000 cards For 1000 failures to occur there have to be 1 million cards in use and by that point I think people will realize they should plug in their cards and there will be improved adapters in circulation I think saying 1 is a super high rate of prevalence is a stretch regardless of scenario
There was a post here like what 2 days ago from MSI saying this exact thing and everyone shit on them for blaming users If Nvidia said this they would have just got flamed hard
This is why we love you guys
Great me neither but there has to be a warning since it s a new connector and people may easily disregard it I know I would hadn t this problem popped up before my purchase
Oh my bad I thought you were serious lol
Nope
Just hold the card as you plug it in you can push back toward the connector and keep from applying all that pressure on the pci socket and motherboard Plugging it in before seating it could work I guess but that seems like another potential stress point on the cable and receptacle as you move it around to get it seated in the board
The other day I made a unboxing installing and advice post on a EKWB block on a 4090 and got downvoted to shit Within 10 minutes I had 20 downvotes when all I was trying to do was write a light install guide to help others with this one difficult part of the install process Then some guy just posts a picture of his Cablemod and gets 100 upvotes
It's driven people to suicide through false accusations When people congregate in an echo chamber and just reinforce each others biases it create a mob mentality that won't be satisfied until there is blood There was a real desire to see the 4090 fail
Also deleted the 12VHPWR page on his website It was a good write up and additional resource regardless of if you agreed with him or not
I think only hardcore hardware enthusiast are familiar with Johnny's work The vast majority of pcmasterrace doesn't know who he is
They're wasting money I will never understand consumers caring about corpos wasting money then providing false sense of security Now that's the first valid point of criticism that I think matters that much The cable would be problematic either way
I think Steve has an actual journalism 't believe he does but has rather worked hard to develop that skill over time Definitely not the easiest path but we benefit from it
100 the same I was careful and waited for the click the first time and I heard it it was a very low click but was there After pulling it out a few times there was no click anymore and trust me I tried
This sub reddit feels like its getting a little toxic Ardent Nvidia people will defend their practices no matter what they do This is clearly a problematic issue and the connector and cable clearly need a redesign Even the possibility of melting should be enough Doesn't matter how low the rate actually is These products are expensive and they should work properly out of the box Im not giving NVidia anymore money till they can 100 guaranteed this wont be a problem Dont try to offload the issue to users alone Make SURE this cant happen before you ask people to buy your product
It s very easy to tell if it s plugged all the way in The clip will be down and you can t walk the plug out of the connector
The really funny thing is we have connectors which are completely idiot proof rated for thousands of cycles and carry far more amps AC outlets They're probably the most user tested technology in existence and they work For 600w the connector should be closer to a two prong AC connector instead of a collection of pins all attached to a single rail
The connecter quality being clearly shit only matters in that very low percentage case The rest of the issues are coming from user error Do the cables need to be improved Yes Are they totally shit right now No Is it a dice roll as to whether you get a good cable or not Not really A 1 in 500 or 1 in 1000 chance is still a pretty huge roll of the dice
To be honest it's not really the GPU that's melting The GPU is fine actually but if the plastic is melted inside the plug then that needs to either be cleaned or replaced Definitely not expensive for AIBs to do and they can resell it as new or refurbished

lol wtf you are making things way worse for yourself unplugging it and plugging it back in that many times you are scraping the nickel and tin off the connectors you are exponentially heightening your risk of failure by obsessively checking as often as you are regardless of it being rated for 30 that is a low number and you absolutely are increasing your odds of failure every time you do it as per GN watch the video from 25 16 if you want to hear GN say exactly what im saying right here
Out of topic but how did you know he blocked you
It s not very hard to insert My CableMod replacement makes a very noticeable click when inserting it and it goes in very smoothly
Molex connectors have and do burn up far more frequently and are still within the industry standards for failure rates that s without user error Those didn t get recalled and people didn t scream about how bad it was and still is People just want big bad evil Nvidia to be the cause so badly ie this is a normal rate for other approved and safe cables this falls down to idiot user error instances where they still had 4mm left to push in quiet
When I installed my adapter first thing I noticed was I had to JAM the PCI 8PIN connectors into the adapter then really jam the adapter into the GPU to make sure it's connected An inexperienced user would think I was trying to break the adapter or the GPU with the amount of force I used there But they went in fine eventually
The biggest problem I have with lumping this whole debacle as 'user error' and be done with it is there was nowhere near a 1 1000 1 2000 catastrophic failure rate on the previous standard So clearly it's way too easy to install the cables improperly if the failure rate is that high and its dependent on users installing their connectors properly Hell just take a look at any secret shopper from Linus and GN themselves and note down how many times they find loose connectors in the prebuilt systems now scale that up to how many computers are sold There will be factory installed cards from SI's that will have this problem and you'll have even less savvy users on your hands The standard for that connector needs to be reviewed like yesterday
you are speculating
These are high powered electrical components They shouldn t be messing with it if they don t know what they re doing
Go paly for the jackpot mate
If you melted 2 cards the problem is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YOU without question
zero have been injured zero houses have burned find me the evidence of that
There have been no fires Lol
did YOU watch vid he said that 99 of failures came from people NOT inserting the adapter fully
Same I said it was user error a while ago and got downvoted a lot Lol
there are a lot of idiots out there who refuse to admit they could ever be wrong
at the end of the day the vast vast majority of users have got it working just fine by the 1 in 1500 stat that s 150 of the 200k they have shipped a pretty small minority mine and many other s 4090s are working fine wonder how many armchair warriors in this thread even have one and know that it is actually very uncommon
says the one who either logged into an alt or created a new account out of rage just to respond to me i mean think about how you look here
150 out of 200k shipped is not a lot my friend steve himself in the video calls it a very small subset of consumers
200k 4090s already shipped and no burned houses reported let me know when that theory works out for you chief
did you not hear when he said the incidence rate is incredibly low it s literally 150 total in the 200k shipped you just hear about each failure very loud because they complain loud those whose connector is working dont say a word 150 out of 200k 4090s is actually lower than your standard failure rate for molex cables also do you even own a 4090 if you did you might know that it is very uncommon also virtually all failures came from when steve had the adapter barely pushed into the port like 4 mm left to push in this data shows it is on users who will probably lie and say they had it pushed all the way in whether or not they actually knew if they did not sure if youve noticed but people do not like to admit when they could be the problem nvidia is very happy right now and it is very likely that lawsuits against them will now go nowhere
150 out of the 200k shipped isnt a lot
Nope no clicking on my Seasonic PRIME
Nope not on my Seasonic PRIME
Not on my Seasonic PRIME they don't
Not on my Seasonic PRIME
Nope not on my Seasonic PRIME
Nope not on my Seasonic PRIME there is no clicking
I am not naive enough to pretend nvidia did not have full control over the connector they wanted to use Then you are willfully ignorant instead of naive PCI SIG has hundreds of members with multiple involved parties for certain applications Any one party can be out voted or overruled that's the whole point of a standards board is to not have a single player like nvidia bully everyone into doing what they want Could Nvidia have chosen not to use 12VHPWR Yes they are in charge of what goes on their board But they still chose from the available options from PCI SIG which was supposed to be used for this exact application AIBs never would have adopted it on their own because it really offers nothing This is a case of making the connector on the cards cheaper and pushing the cost externally Your own two sentences are contradictory It offers nothing but it's also cheaper So it does offer something It means manufacturers including AIB partners don't have to have 3 connectors on their boards Which saves them materials cost and assembly time
Hopefully the rumors of the sense pins being moved back in the new standard by PCI SIG are true I've seen visually the updated connector and the housing for the sense pins does extend further back but I'm not sure if the sense pins themselves do but if they do that would be a solution for the 'user error' If the design can be accommodated so you can't incorrectly plug in the adapter cable then it should be
3090ti has the sense pins You re thinking of the 3090 non Ti
Let me quote the guy I was replying to If other NVIDIA have the same connector and don t have those issues then it s not the connector being bad but a batch not being made properly Nvidia had until yesterday exactly ONE card on the market Doesn't matter how many of them they made And to be more detailed it's not a matter of the model of the card it's a matter of the connectors used and if they use the 12V HPWR connector they are all susceptible to this problem Doesn't matter if it's an Nvidia card Intel card AMD card or in a weird homebrew devices that uses this connector The connector is the problem Well and an inability to read and understand threaded forums
The 3090 Ti doesn't have the same cable as it doesn't have the sense pins It's true that it's a 12 pin but since it doesn't have the sense pins it's a different design and it might not have the same feedback problem Intel s new server GPU The Intel Arc uses the old 6 and 8 pin sockets The Intelregistered Server GPU XG310 uses a 4 pin connector as it's a 150W card I can't find anything else on Intel's GPU product page so if you're talking about a specific Intel product that uses the same 12 pin power connector with 4 sense pins you'll have to be a lot more specific than a product name that apparently only references the XG310
The voting system is a joke and used incorrectly You're supposed to only downvote spam and irrelevant content per the Reddit etiquette guidelines I believe people should only get a number of downvotes they can give a date that way they think long and hard if it's worth even downvoting
And Linus will quote Jay cause he's too salty to acknowledge GN He's even deleting comments about GN now Real class act
95 and another 80 of Jayz not watching the whole GN video
Jay is so far below the standard for tech YouTubers LTT might target their content at a broader audience but Linus and his employees genuinely have expert level experience and knowledge of various parts of the tech space Jay just makes stuff up and creates clickbait I can't get through a single video of his without being reminded that he has entry level tech knowledge at best
Jay probably earned far more than GN during his time in Youtube why didn t he invest the money back into the channel Oh wait he was busy restoring classic cars and buying muscle cars and an R8
I will say we have been pretty thoroughly conditioned to expect a click when we plug something and no click came no matter what I did But I'm more confused as to why somebody would try and plug it in not get a click then go fuck it Good enough and just fire that shit up without wondering why it didn't click in like EVERY SINGLE OTHER COMPONENT IN THEIR COMPUTER
Anonymous online posting with little repercussions tend to encourage the worse side of humanity Nothing at stake so the worst comes out
all this doesn't mean that the design isn't flawed It simply should not work if not plugged all the way in
Honestly if it is such an easy mistake to make user side something needs to be done about it anyway
I will say sorry to Nvidia if they make an official statement telling customers what the root cause is I have to thank people like Steve for letting me have a peace of mind Nvidia is still irresponsible I m sorry
when it comes to potential fire hazards they tend to be yeah
It has always applied I guess nbsp But was a little strange to see since the reported problems were all at the GPU end of the connector
Before you become too categorical let me correct you by saying he explicitly mentioned that he put a 4090 into his home system to check if it melts in regular use Go watch his latest video
Jay got me started when it came to building my first PC
Probably hard to add chapters when most of his video is mindless rambling
The number of pins likely is the reason why the connectors are made so poorly If you need 12 pins instead of 6 you want to spend half as much on each pin Microfit terminals are about a cent per piece the same as the traditional Minifit Jr terminals wholesale alibaba prices And even whenever I buy relatively low numbers of terminals more like a thousand terminals per order it's still only 2 or 3 cents per terminal 12 small pins can supply more power than 4 big pins with the same amount of material because the smaller ones have a greater surface area I think they should've just used a sturdier connector like a 16 pin minifit jr connector so it would take up the same area as a double 8 pin pcie but they could still make it a new spec that could easily carry 580W without even requiring HCS terminals Or they could require HCS terminals and 16awg wire and push it to 1kW
Molex connectors burned like crazy back in the day this is nothing new really
Cars are actually a perfect example of that attitude because statistics have shown that as cars grew in safety reckless driving grew at the same pace The safer people feel in their cars the more risky behavior they undertake
Yeah the number of failures seems to be relatively low So not so widespread that everybody is doing it wrong therefore it is a design issue You can also find pictures of burned up 6 and 8 pin PCIe cables likely due to similar issues of users not fully properly inserting the connectors But those were not associated with a brand new 1600 GPU so not nearly as interesting to report on
100k per nvidia's numbers x 0 05 is still 5000 people That's way too many people to just be user error HDD probably don't even have that much failure rates and they're sold in millions
That number represents meltdowns not the number of people who have the cable inserted incorrectly I wouldn't be surprised if more people don't have it fully seated correctly but also don't have it bent so much to make it melt At the end of the day still seems like a design flaw to me
Probably not Years ago I left a comment politely disagreeing with Jay and he went ballistic about how he has X millions of subscribers so fuck anyone who disagrees with him
Poor wording lol But not he was nice and tried to make conversation and Jay seemed to not care and brushed him off I get that not everyone who s famous would want to get bothered but from how his Internet personality is his real life personality didn t match
No I watched the whole thing Yes the connector is tight but there is a latch even if there is no audible click If you can wiggle the connector out of its socket it's not fully latched There should be no spacing when fully latched If there is it's not fully seated and should not be used I'm not saying that the design can't be improved but if there are still users who are booting up their systems without the cables fully latched that's on them
What other connector families were you thinking of As I said I have only really worked extensively with a handful of connectors in terms of design I've seen minifit present all over devices like fridges ceiling fans light fixtures and car mod harnesses
I haven't bought them but I am considering it However the value in this specific product is that they are unique You can buy a 10 pack of cork coasters for 30 sure But you can't get PC tech themed ones And some people are enthusiasts and enjoy the aesthetic
It's a lot when you're looking at the thing at the right angle When it's tucked away in a case and you're not specifically looking for it it's tiny despite what some men will claim
Then give it a tug If it comes out you didn't have it latched
DEG is awesome stuff for exposed connectors on battery terminals in cars absolutely It creates a silicone barrier that keeps moisture off the contacts Almost every mechanic worth their salt does that to car battery connectors It's a silicone based grease so is non conductive Spreading it on the outside if a 12VHPWR cable very thinly will definitely work If people go slathering it on in excess and it gets inside the connector though there's the potential for it to create a thin barrier between the conductor pins on the cable itself and the socket pins That can lead to raising the resistance and causing the kind of failures we're seeing Basically a foreign object like GN talked about just a different source The reason I generally suggest 99 9 IPA is that it reduces the possibility that someone will mess it up is all You can't really use too much IPA It'll evaporate extremely quickly and it'll lubricate the connector just long enough to plug it in There won't be any left on the connector after a few minutes DEG on the other hand will definitely be left on the connector and you definitely wouldn't want to get it all over the inside of the terminals where the conductors are Anyways as for warranty technically doing either would void the warranty IPA won't leave any evidence behind though face with tears of joy
Well you presented two different scenarios as If someone THINKS when it can unseat the cable When someone thinks something and it's wrong that's an error and if they were simply wrong then it's user error However if a faulty design such as when it can unseat the cable caused the state of the cable to change then it would mean the user was right initially but a defective design caused the state of the cable to change So I focused on the portion of your statement that moves this from user error to design defect x200B Even Steve in the video twice talked about and showed a video where the cable can be erroneously presumed Yes but it's still the user making that error When this happens the result is to burn up rather than to disconnect or power off the card Yes that tends to be how most power leads work Electricity is dangerous If you were to work on at outlet at your house and think the power is off and electrocute yourself it wouldn't be the outlet manufacturers fault You are the one connecting and modifying the hardware doing so correctly is your responsibility Also if a retention clip was to break or fail then what should the outcome of that failure be How is that relevant You're just going to throw out random questions and situations that aren't even occurring now We could talk to the end of time about what ifs Yes yes yes yes and what if the core is made of cheese The Core 2003 That said retention clips aren't breaking regularly and if they were it would have to be determined if it was misuse by the user or design defect If it's the user Don't use broken hardware Don't put strain on your electrical cables that can pull 200 1200W Don't hook up electrical leads if you don't know how to do so For design manufacturer defect I've never seen a retention clip just break when not being adjusted Or a cable pull itself out that wasn't strained However if you could again PROVE that this is happening regularly and that it isn't because the user is mishandling it Then you might have something Again though you would have to have some kind of proof to these theories and claims If you could just provide proof that the first issue you suggesting is even happening though your argument might have a leg to stand on So again since you made the claim and since it's the distinguishing point between user error and defect Have there been proven cases of fully seated cables unseating themselves
Which requires twice the punishment these new ones can take
Americans take 411 billion daily trips a year or about 1 500 trips per person If 99 9 of car journeys had no trouble differentiating the brake and gas pedal society would screech to a halt as some 400 MILLION car accidents would happen every single year in the US alone
Users are reporting that they get no good way to confirm it is inserted properly I d say that is a no With 8 pins you know damn well when it is inserted right
It is shitty design quality when you don t know if it is seated properly As a user it should be very apparent There should be at the very least an audible feedback Many users reported having to force it in and still weren t sure Even those beefy 24 pin cables that you need to force in give you some sort of audible feedback Edit From watching the video they even talk about other dubious manufacturing quality issues This is indeed a shit adapter and cable design
it is absolutely not entirely on shitty design quality when they all work fine when inserted properly But that's exactly the problem if you don't get feedback that it's seated properly how do you really know it's seated properly How do you know that after you plug it in and put the case back on that it didn't come unseated unknowingly to you I'm sure the people that had adapter issues thought it was seated properly That's a design problem
according to Samsung
That wasn t user error
this is user error related samsung s issue was not your analogy is bad
Molex connectors have and do burn up far more frequently and are still within the industry standards for failure rates that s without user error Those didn t get recalled and people didn t scream about how bad it was and still is People just want big bad evil Nvidia to be the cause so badly
If you're driving and 1 in every 1000 times you hop into your car it spontaneously melted That's not what it's like it's like if one out of every 1000 cars on the road broke down this year Which uh they do But also about one out of every 9000 people who use a car this year will die in it death rate 11 7 100K I always have to chuckle when people go If your car did because cars are so much more dangerous than people generally think it's just that we use them a lot so we're inoculated against the level of danger that they pose
0 1 is not too high when it's the result of user error Where's the user error in your analogy It'd be more like if the car manufacturer told you not to smoke while pumping gas and the gas station told you not to smoke while pumping gas You smoke while pumping gas anyway and that has a 0 1 chance of starting a fire and you expect the car to be recalled
it spontaneously melted More like after you pour gasoline on hot parts by doing something dumb This excluding unavoidable defects that any production have involve the used making a mistake it's not something that just happens
That s why you shouldn t build your own engine if you don t know how
Wasn't that for the iPhone 4
Only if you count X M P the most I do to my PC is research optimal bios windows setting to let my stuff turbo properly
Ah ok sorry Yeah I agree but if you didn't know your cable was THAT loose it's on you I agree the design could provide more feedback but that connector is barely hanging on in the melt tests
Thanks I'll keep my cable and save my money No point in buying overpriced cable
I'll keep my current stock cable then Thanks Gamer Nexus for the investigation
Yes I 100 agree User error should not result in melting cables
In general the PC community hates miners and by extension crypto At least in my experience
Thank you for the replies and understand Already else where got a f you and thinking 1 source of research Is only thing
Very few have been recalled for that failure rate due to user error Lower failure rates have been recalled if they were provably manufacturing defect or design flaw But user error is much harder to regulate EDIT probably provably autocorrect strikes again
Yeah cause there was no data behind it It was a meme post on instagram lol
there are some salty jealous people
would be cool to have a community list of such guides
Because amd good nvidia bad Haven't you heard How dare you spend your hard earned money on what you want
If this many users have an error it's not just user error anymore I mean my country's population literally re elected a party that literally brought the country to bankruptcy 4 years earlier after doubling debt in 2 mandates led my a guy who literally went to prison afterwards But yes the connectors are part of the problem
But the 4090 connector does click You can hear it
o weird
They didn't do that in the first place because that's not what they're doing Read what the sense pins do and what the modification does in that order and you'll understand better
They'd increase price one way or other They're business not charity I think if they upgrade the case they'd reflect that somewhere If they give modded cables they'd reflect that somewhere Giving stuff free can't last forever And false sense of security is especially true for pre built pc that would shake up cables in transit Or even when packing removing foam
It s a kind of shitty connector but luckily the problem isn t overly widespread That said 1 in 1000 failure rate is kind of a lot in the context of millions of gpus being sold to a wide range of technically competent consumers
I said 3 times 3 And I'm not checking again Is 3 a big number to you
Reddit prevents you from replying under any comment a user makes that has blocked you regardless if it's a direct reply to them or another user with them randomly being 3 or 4 replied up the chain It fully locks you out from any discussion they participate in regardless of who started it how large it is or the context It just gives you a generic something went wrong try again bullshit 'error' but in actuality it's due to being blocked It's appalling and completely breaks the site if people use it maliciously You could reply to someone with whatever insults false facts whatever then immediately block them Hell you could reply to them even if you blocked them ages ago via some convoluted means and they have no way to respond publicly If someone malicious blocks a bunch of regular users on a sub then maliciously posts comments there's nothing the regulars the most likely users to call them out on the bullshit could do short of getting mods involved but depending on the sub good luck with that It's a completely fucked up shitty fix because Reddit had issues with harassment they went the nuclear route that fundamentally ruins conversation on this site
However there aren't a whole lot of molex connectors in use on a modern PC You might use one for a watercooling pump a bluray drive or maybe a fan or fan controller It's a pretty short list I'd also argue that molex connectors don't burn up anywhere near as often as the 12VPHWR has been Think about it if molex connectors had a 0 1 failure rate you'd be seeing a lot more problems that we do There's probably on the order of billions of them in use How many 12VPHWR's are in use Maybe a couple of 100 000
How much does nvidia pay you to do damage control
People also say molex to sata lose all your data Not really a great example
Just my opinion Hopefully those users an unaffected ones can learn from this and gain some experience next time they need it
There's a saying we have here that roughly translates to something like you learn by breaking things up How is someone new to this hobby niche whatever supposed to gain experience and learn as they go By doing things themselves Sometimes you mess up but if the lesson is learned they will be better for it
The 5 nvidia engineers I was on a call with last night weren t as sure as you are that it was user error I m sending them the 2nd cable for review as they are still investigating They already have my original cable You obviously did not watch the GN video to come into that conclusion as they stated that there are various things into effect
One of the issues they GN theorized was that the pins on the card side could de laminate but they didn't have a card to confirm This could be the problem here
Yet Melting cables on power supplies it s only a matter of time Do the facetious
the tin gets scraped off the copper which allows for resistance from oxidization that causes the failure from normal insertion How is this user error when it's basically unheard of with previous cables connectors and can lead to issues way further down the road in time
How's the 13900k I'm about to pull the trigger and replace my 5900x I think so at
My SeaSonic Prime clicks with its cables
The plugs don t rely on socket pressure to keep them inserted Lol
Local redditor learns they haven't ever plugged their cables in correctly In jest of course I'll wait for someone else with that PSU to counter But they absolutely should if you're plugging them in correctly
A standard is any design you want registered with SIG for a fee Anyone can make anything a standard Do you have any real arguments Being a standard has no bearing on usage Nvidia pushed this connector and they did it right out in the open It is laughable that people are clinging to the lame old argument of standard Show me the 600 watt amd card because why would amd have ever needed this Nvidia used it and got PSU makers onboard That is how they go adoption Being a registered standard has nothing to do with actual adoption People are way too consumed by the word standard I don't get it
Hundreds of members and only a handful makes graphics cards I fail to see your point SIG will make a standard out of anything if you pay them It doesn't mean anyone is going to use it Being a standard does not mean anyone will use it Nvidia was the clear catalyst behind this connector and I don't understand why anyone would deny something that happened right out in the open You haven't actually made a real argument at all AMD adopting it because nvidia got PSU companies to adopt it doesn't mean AMD pushed this Show me the amd card pulling 600 watts They had no need to change any connectors
Fundamentally they need to pay for more stable couplers that accept the pins This is really a cost cutting thing at its core because when they chose the pin couplers they would have used cost as a deciding factor The two approved connectors both had melting issues It is fixable and aftermarket cables can definitely exceed the two options in the standard by using better connectors
Edit I replied to the wrong post My bad

What's the beef I follow both channels but not aware
Are you sure it's salt of LTT Youtube is so happy at deleting everything other than spam that I sometime split my answer into several parts as one long comment almost always gets deleted
Proof or didn't happen
Oh yeah that wasn't a diss at Linus he's my go to for casual tech stuff I just meant to say that some of their content isn't super serious like GN and that JayZ isnt super serious either
I'm not gonna defend how he runs his business or money I have a lot more respect for GN But if I click on a JayZ video I know what to expect as long as he doesn't straight up LIE or come to conclusions with 100 certainty then I don't think he's doing anything wrong I'm trying to stay neutral here because I don't even like the guy
Or maybe because he doesn't want to be a GN style I've watched him for quite a while now and it's not infrequent that he says he's just aiming to be the layman's tech channel something unscripted informative and fun for the majority out there rather than an in depth analysis channel with rigorous testing like GN He has no obligation to spend money on expensive testing devices and developing testing methodologies Is he clickbaity and in this situation too quick to tell people explanations with no backing up Sure but please realize that not everyone is looking to watch 30 minutes of scripted product testing full of charts and explanations
I love Reddit and a lot of its communities but holy shit the bad side of Reddit is fucking horrendous and the witch hunting side is the worst of the worst Nothing beats the Boston bomber fiasco but it just keeps fucking happening
as per GN s video it has to be SIGNIFICANTLY unseated for it to fail like 4mm left to push in they couldn t recreate failures when they inly had 1mm left to insert this is 100 on idiot users who were not careful
Right Of course the user should at least treat their 1600 graphics card with more certainty in their power connector However it would be an easy revision to make a tab that it clicks better to give better user feedback Overall overblown on the issue but there is a problem with a design if such easy failure can exist
What a joke Companies have literally refused to announce life threatening conditions with their products because they calculated that recalls are more expensive than a few wrongful death lawsuits Keep drinking that corporate kool aid
We had one PSU side with melting reported
Which video
But i digress
Insertion issues were much easier to visibly see Anyone can be reckless These 12vpwr connectors can have issues that aren't visible to the end user especially when people have to sandwich them in to close their case No way to really inspect it like you can do with a molex The design is poor if microscopic debris can also cause an issue People need to blast them with canned air before insertion I've had pins pop out of the back of molex connectors when plugging them in You can directly see it and fix it You can be careful with 12vpwr and still have it randomly burn up in the future The only positive is that it is just melting the connectors and not starting an actual fire At least the plastic used with these is a good material for containing failures
You can also find pictures of burned up 6 and 8 pin PCIe cables likely due to similar issues of users not fully properly inserting the connectors We just had some users reporting burned microfit connectors 30 series FE stuff too Shit happens
I think we can all be honest with ourselves and say it comes mostly down to the massive hate boner currently harbored for nvidia They 3000 series launch came with pretty equal amounts of over the top vitriol
He said 0 05 which is 0 0005 So 100k 0 0005 50 people Look acceptable to me In fact I thought that number is quite low since I saw way too many idiots on Reddit
Wait 100k people bought that overpriced card in the first couple weeks I guess it wasn t overpriced
Your calculation is assuming that 5 of users have the issue To multiply by a percentage you have to push the decimal point two places to the left The correct calculation would be 100 000 0005 50 With the worst case percentage of 1 it would be 100 cases
It s certainly not a bonus feature
I was just poking fun at how the comment was written like the brother was the one being rude
Imagine trying to get groceries and some stranger insists on having a conversation or else you're the asshole lol
Yes and this is why it is 1 in a 1000 This is still way to high Maybe people don't understand this even if the User should make it correct the chance that a user does something bad should be like 1 to 1 000 000 Do you forget that this is a consumer product There are probably a lot of children building PCs too It is the job of designers to prevent user error Maybe you don't have experience in this field but this is not acceptable to design standards You can look up the universal design rules if you don't believe me Of course I agree with you 100 this could me avoided by the User And if all User should be expert then it is user error But it is made for consumers and if 1 1000 users make this error then it falls under the category bad design If it was so Chinese company that build super cheap cables then ok sure but it is Nvidia Would you react similarly if it was Toyota oder Chevrolet oder General Electric or whatever big company
You can buy a 10 pack of cork coasters for 8 from walmart not 30 Unique or not it's overpriced I mean not my money so I can't tell people how to spend theirs but overpriced IMO
The point is that you should look for it as part of a final verification process you are assembling a damn computer this process require some attention and care even if it's not particularly complicated
if its latched then it should be full inserted It seems like thats not whats happening and its easy to not push them all the way that what seems to be happening to me
That's a good point I wonder if inserting the adapter before putting the card in the pc might also be a good strategy It takes a decent amount of force and that would prevent you from stressing the pcie slot and card itself Note I didn't do this with my card but in retrospect it would have made sense
Have you ever heard of the phrase duck typing It s a principle where if it walks like a duck and a quacks like a duck then it s probably a duck The idea is to get people to accept that if they designed something that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it s not supposed to be a duck then they made it wrong You hear a lot of designers fight against duck typing when they make a really bad user interface They will blame the user error because in their mind they made the perfect user interface and if people would just learn how to use it properly then there wouldn t be an issue They refuse to accept duck typing where they need to account for a users ignorance or learning curve of the product and attempt to make a better user interface that is more intuitive or gives better cues to the user to let them know if they re doing something right or wrong
and yet the occurrence rate is 0 05 and they don t fail when inserted properly i heard a click and confirmed there was no gap this is the case for the vast majority of users
by visually confirming that there is zero gap between adapter and gpu
Connectors that are physically incapable of clicking securely into place due to poor manufacturing tolerances and connectors with a nickel tin coating that flakes off on a single insertion filling the connector with loose flecks of metal aren't user error either
100 the people in this sub just dont like being told that they re wrong
Dumb ass statement
Blinking is not a designed product sold at luxury prices upheld to responsibility laws
You can't recall a nuclear explosion You can recall a connector that is shoddily designed
Yes
i overclock my bdie properly 1 5v with tuned subtimings hence why i need the cooling fan
It might also be because most of the users are used to the old 8 pin where you can still easily move it about while cable routing since it securely attaches to the GPU
You think 19 90 29 90 is overpriced D
user error can result in burning or melting in many places in a pc you can absolutely fuck up big time in many other places on a pc and no one seems to be complaining about that
There was plenty of data Igor concluded that it was the insertion of the 12VHPWR cable giving issues with it Johnnyguru concluded that it was mainly the improper contact of the 12VHPWR cable Both received extreme garbage from this subreddit over it Not saying that this is the only case but there are a host of other factors of the connectors burning But when GamersNexus made that conclusion everyone acts like he was the first one to conclude that Its pretty obvious that this subreddit has a cultish love of Gamersnexus Not to say hes a bad youtuber hes probably one of the best tech youtubers out there But I cannot say the same for their toxic fanbase This is not to say the 12VHPWR connector is a good connector In reality its probably the worst designed connector I ever handled If the connector is so badly designed that users are repeatedly failing to properly connect their cables It means its a badly designed connector
It is bizarre alright Jay in particular seems to have an anger boner about them at the minute it's all so bizarre
People want what they can't afford to crash and burn Just like when they see someone in a lambo they hope they crash and destroy their car People are naturally evil and envious we as mankind have lost our ways The fact that we enjoy watching other people fail and things get destroyed says a lot about us
I feel like in this case you can both be right End users and people in general can be dumb as fuck However things that will see wide use are often designed to account for people being dumb as fuck The connector is an engineering marvel it's passing up to 600 watts through a very small connector and doing so safely with proper use But people are dumb as fuck When this thing is NOT used properly it fails You could say the same about the previous 8 pin connectors but they were BEEFY and people were used to them They had a loud click larger pins larger wires and could actually carry double the power of their maximum power draw which is a hell of a buffer In addition to the loud click it was so easy to tell when they were fully seated both by feel and visually you'd have to be a monkey to leave 4 5mm out of it and think it was in all the way tl dr People are indeed dumb as fuck and designing and deploying a connector that needs people to not be dumb as fuck is going to cause problems
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kinda dumb With her finger and her thumb In shape of an L on her forehead
What country is this
My be quiet adapter did not There is a pretty huge variance depending on the manufactur My be quiet adapter looks different than the NV adapter from NTK or Astron So there are at least three different ones probably even more
They'd increase price one way or other They're business not charity Starforge was already overpriced to begin with lol Also eating up some costs is actually a real thing And false sense of security is especially true for pre built pc that would shake up cables in transit Or even when packing removing foam And the OG Nvidia cable would be untrustworthy either way
1 in 1000 is tiny
Yeah I don't know why people think 1in 1000 is a low rate
salt detected it is when the GN video said that any amount of repeatedly reinserting the connecter could result in the nickel and tin scraping off take GN s words for it not mine also an incidence rate of 05 says that the design is fine data is data and downvotes wont make what i said false final verdict by GN mostly user error go argue with him lol
Not enough it all burned up after 3 cycles
He's doing this pro bono cut him some slack
They should have basic knowledge to plug everything thing in all the way
aren't there 2 cable types made by different companies where one has a high chance of malfunction
Sure you were God your claim gets more and more ridiculous by the minute
I'm not defending nvidia but the risk of uncontrolled fire is quite low here I haven't seen any reports of temperatures high enough to actually ignite the plastic and the plastic will have fire retardants Not to mention there's simply not that much plastic in there and it's all usually contained in a glass and metal box You could probably leave a lit candle in a computer case and not start a house fire
There has been no melting on the power supply side
It s pretty awesome Games run at their best It runs pretty cool too when gaming and power draw isn t insane i believe it is normally in the 50 s and much less than 200W Only if you push it with some crazy stress test does it ramp up the temps and power but by default it will settle at 253W after a bit and for me at least around 75 C when doing a long 10min cinebench r23 loop If I set my case fans and the fans on my H150i to max the 13900k tops out just below the 100 mark and uses around 310W of power before it goes down after the boost timer 90 seconds expires
Slow clap you don't even understand what I
Seasonic Focus 't have an audible click but they do have a tactile click
I have three Seasonic PRIME psus two platinum and one gold and a couple corsair RM All made in 2020 2021 and I'm a professional IT admin They absolutely don't NEED to click at all the plug relies on a tight fit with the pin receivers compressing the pin The clip is there just to secure it I'm honestly not surprised that a lot of people in this sub don't even know
Nvidia was the clear catalyst behind this connector and I don't understand why anyone would deny something that happened right out in the open
SIG will not make a standard for anyone who pays them Lol
You mean the one that has a release date in January and thus not in the market as of yet How is that relevant to what I replied to If other NVIDIA have the same connector and don t have those issues then it s not the connector being bad but a batch not being made properly
Probably the backpack warranty thing GN criticized Linus over it and said they GN can no longer treat Linus Media Group with kid gloves now that LTT is putting out its own products it would be unfair to viewers and other companies for GN to not treat LTT with the same objective standards as others instead of a youtube colleague friend it felt pressured into giving a bit more leeway Which is a fair 'm sure some fans have tried making it larger than it is although idk anything about this recent banning GN comments or w e
I straight up avoid any J2C content bc I know what to expect
Have all those idiots lied on Reddit telling they inserted all the way Last few cases people said outright they heard a click
Missed that one nbsp This whole thing made me paranoid enough to check my own adapter
4080 initial review
cue audience laugh
They 3000 series launch came with pretty equal amounts of over the top vitriol But lacked the burned cables
I'm tired I read it as Was your brother being rude to Jay Derp
Are you an ass to anyone who talks to you Or when you don t want to do you politely end the conversation
A failure rate of 0 05 0 1 is not entirely outlandish in this product field Better QA could resolve the connectors with actual physical defects but the rest is really about educating the user Nvidia hasn't made a formal comment on it but a simple diagram like MSI posted should be good enough for most people
Y 'm hearing this should be doable with no attention or care whatsoever
You should be wiggling every connector you plug in to make sure it's seated fully That's how you double check the latch and seating If you wiggle and nothing happens it's latched but if it comes out it wasn't and while it might not be able to be fully seated with a manufacturing defect you'll know it before using it rather than when it melts because you said well it won't latch but it's probably fully in
Yeah I didn't either and think you're right It's far easier to plug the PSU side cables in than it is at the GPU side Working in reverse makes a lot of sense I'll probably do that when my cablemod cable arrives come to think of it I was genuinely surprised at how much force it took to seat the new 12VHPWR connector Wel at least the one on my 4090 and supplied adapter anyway It's actually perfectly understandable some users aren't plugging them in all the way right I've seen a lot of comments in this thread where people mock others and call them idiots for not plugging their cables in fully I can absolutely see why some users haven't plugged them in all the way We're usually told not to force connectors in right This whole debacle has been a wild ride
Cool You can't prove what you're arguing You'll argue everything else instead Got it
This doesn t change the fact that it is a garbage design that encourages user error Any design that behaves in that way needs to be fixed Steve gave some pretty good suggestions that could be implemented to fix it Why these weren t already in the spec despite it pushing much more current is beyond me Edit Lol I got blocked because I made him sad Anyways here is what I was going to say Cool Molex is a dated design in my opinion that needs to finally be retired in favor of something more modern and failure tolerant Just because it is still used doesn t mean it is good We had numerous designs in use in many different industries that were known to be very unsafe but still met guidelines in that industry Doesn t mean they were good At all They caused numerous problems and had data showing such I ll never understand how people can be so far up Nvidia s butt that they are missing a pretty big issue in their choices especially on what they are touting to be such a premium product Interesting He is blocking everyone who doesn t agree with him Not usually a good sign
I tried to say that many times on reddit with gn fan 's always a death threat I get in 't understand peer reviewed
he does for clicks that's all he cares about he still has his false info videos up including the 30 series BS he uses that platform to brainwash and send them out in the wild
He was the first to bring up the 30 cycles on the cable and probably felt he should get some credit for this thing even though it's unrelated Plus he never misses a chance to tell us about the 4090 in his home rig
They did announce and published the changes they re making
I would say it's a bad look if you send 2 pages email to everyone saying you're solving the problem in this way or that way and then it turns out your solution wasn't fixing anything Like it's good to solve problems fast but at least understand problems and find right solution In case i didn't mention my comment was not purely from consumer perspective but also from business perspective A lot of attention going into pre built pc companies these days and how they run make profit
Its quite big actually
If taking out and reinserting the connector 1 10th the rated amount is causing damage there is a problem with the connector not the user 05 It was 0 1 to 0 05 Either one is quite high imagine if 1 in 1000 cars caught fire
You're honestly depressing this is still awful and unacceptable connector design whatever way you put it
salt detected lmfao projection detected
Jesus you re a dipshit
I agree but the adapter connector in this case doesn't help things though so it's a lesson the inexperienced users will have to learn by themselves
That's what GN mentioned in the video It appears that there are a total of 3 manufacturers as one of them uses a subcontractor
No per the video they're all basically the same The massive issue is user error which is possible due to admittedly poor design
You do realizing that Nvidia has been contacting everyone who has posted here about a melted cable right They are trying to get to the bottom of it as much as GN and everyone else
It's low for sure but it's unacceptably high when it could be orders of magnitude lower with a better design
Awesome Good info thanks I hope my 280mm AIO is enough to get max boost I made sure to upgrade my 850w PSU to 1300w so power shouldn't hopefully be a problem
They absolutely don't NEED to click at all the plug relies on a tight fit with the pin receivers compressing the pin The clip is there just to secure it This is exactly what you said That it is relying on a tight fit to keep the cable inserted you are wrong
Yes you can feel the click when it s inserted all the way
There you go again Registering a standard does not mean anyone is going to use it There are millions of standards across thousands of standards bodies and organizations that aren't used by anyone hd dvd was a standard who was forced to use it over bluray No one A standard is just a registered spec it has no bearing on usage If it is used but not registered it is a de facto standard and there are plenty of those De facto does not mean worse or better which is the same as registered Being a standard implies nothing about how good or bad it is or if anyone will even use it Many standards start off as defacto competing against other defacto standards They get registered to try to simplify the market But it is still up to the person pushing it to lobby for anyone else to use it
Intel does not use the connector so this is hilarious You realize that is exactly what I said right Nvidia pushed psu makers to adopt it because nvidia was going to use it no matter what They all jumped in under fear that competitors would adopt it and use it to advertise against the PSUs that needed adapters
That is how all standards groups work They will publish anything if you pay them It doesn't mean anyone is going to use it In the actual standard document 12vhpwr is optional SIG doesn't tell anyone they need to use it Page 12 2022 to atx 3 0 Nvidia was using it on 30xx series before it was in atx 3 0 The description These are optional connectors for the power supply to support additional power needed by any PCI Express Add in Card AIC The most common PCIe Add in Card that uses these connectors are discrete graphics cards The PCIe CEM Specification defines different connectors based on the power used by the Add in Card which can range from 75 watts up to 600 watts You are free to use four 4 pins to carry 600 watt if you want Manufacturers get to choose But when nvidia is forcing it on the market they will include it in fear of competitors using it against them in marketing
It s relevant because Intel is using the 12VHPWR connector lol
It s unfortunate to see if that s the case Linus and Steve always seemed to have a positive rapport with the two even making impromptu calls to each other on the WAN show sometimes to talk more in depth about a topic Linus always spoke highly of GN which I think was good since LTT is more friendly to entry level viewers whereas GN is more into in depth numbers and analysis so a newer viewer might be steered towards GN after hearing about them from LTT Hope it s coincidental but I noticed Linus didn t make any mention of GN s coverage of EVGA leaving the GPU space even though GN s video had a lot of valuable information in it That said I agree with GN if LTT is going to enter the manufacturing space it d be unfair for GN to ignore issues with LTT s handling of things especially when GN is known for really going after companies to do their best to protect the interests of consumers Like you said I haven t seen heard anything about LTT deleting any mention of GN and Linus is increasingly more hands off in the writing of the content and management of the channel so who knows At the end of the day none of us are personal friends with any of them and their relationships with each other are their business I d just miss seeing how collaborative they are since the major tech channels are generally good at working with each other to cover a wide range of information
Where are they deleting comments Not to say it isn't happening but it doesn't seem to align with their history
These are competing companies and should call each other out as any other company It's good for everyone in the long run It keeps them honest and fair
probably some were people are unwilling to admit they could be at fault
Have all those idiots lied on Reddit telling they inserted all the way Yes of course The first thing you do is deny deny deny any error so that your warranty doesn't get denied denied denied
Yeah it wasn't during the 4090 scare but an ATX 3 0 with a 3090Ti iirc Edit Apologies it was two 8 pins on the PSU side
01 he says he's been using one in his system at home but he didn't say if he was doing any specific tests to see if the connector would melt and he still says that it looks like one adapter is better than the other which is not something he has tested himself Much later towards the end he also says he doesn't think melting connections will be an issue because of the lower power draw but just last week we had another thread about a melted RTX 3080 FE connector
Wasn t there a 30 series with a burnt cable like two days ago
They were also not as easily acquired due to crypto miners buying them up before most gamers were able to get a hold of them And for all the criticisms I could level at crypto miners I do actually expect them to be diligent about plugging power connectors in
Yes Two things can be true at once
If I said I don't want to talk or no thank you it'd still be interpreted as rude for a lot of people You're also not entitled to kindness for being the one initiating things with strangers
No 0 05 0 1 is definitely not ok for a single part To me the problem seems to be a general concept of cheap manufacturing and this is a high end product As I said if I buy a cheap cable for 2 sure but as the included cable of a 1600 product This is just greed which should not be accepted by customers
Wiggle as it was shown in the video Pull move the cables left and right repeatedly to check if the connector loosens up
Nah man If you build computers and don't look to see that the latch is locked or pull on the cable a little to verify it's latched you're fucking up It's laziness building computers isn't hard but that doesn't mean you don't need to even pay attention or double check your work This goes for 24 pin 8 pin CPU any cable with a latch
More stating that you are refusing to believe that design error in engineering is exacerbating user error and that is the real story Your arguments remind me of that principal Skinner meme where he s wondering am I had a touch with reality No it is the users that are wrong
Molex connectors have and do burn up far more frequently and are still within the industry standards for failure rates that s without user error Those didn t get recalled and people didn t scream about how bad it was and still is People just want big bad evil Nvidia to be the cause so badly ie this is a normal rate for other approved and safe cables this falls down to idiot user error instances where they still had 4mm left to push in the failure rate shown here indicates that it is a fine connector given that an already approved and safe molex cable burns at a higher rate also likely due to user error eat your words
Plus his opinions change with the wind One minute he s slamming Nvidia for something and the next he s begging people to buy their cards to reward them for being anti consumer
This Exactly They're extending the plastic piece to cover the sideband wires so they don't get damaged during removal For the design to change to allow for easier insertion removal they're going to need a complete retool and I seriously doubt that Nvidia is going to change the physical interface on the GPU itself any time soon At least not this generation or the next The best thing for Nvidia to do is to remove the sideband altogether We never saw these failures with 30 series FE cards and many all 3090 Ti cards It wasn't until the sideband was added which adds an additional degree of difficulty to fully inserting the connector into the card The mating of the 12 conductors is the same for the old 30 FE connector and the new 12VHPWR connector So it would be VERY easy for them to just release a VBIOS that ignores the sense pins completely and then issue standard 12 pin connectors without the sideband moving forward
you're solving the problem in this way or that way and then it turns out your solution wasn't fixing anything That's a very good point also from business perspective And that's where I will never look from because it's not my business
Lol no not really 0 05 0 1 is infinitesimally small when it comes to consumer product defects
And you are a literal professional cable melter So they definitely are on a conference call with you obviously
Nope free design diagrams of any 6 or 8 pin connector are on google showing you have no idea what you're talking about buy hey imagine not being able to understand them and then argue
Intel does not use the connector Yet Someone always has to be first And there's more parties involved than just the device that takes the power but also power supply makers would have a vested interest in simplifying things Everything you are saying is just wild speculation
They do in their server GPUs and will use it in their next series of consumer GPUs
No that is not how they work
It is irrelevant because it is not in the market place
Can t say I agree since I wouldn t lie if it happened to me and I m overly cautious about potentially hazardous hardware
Crypto crashed months ago you can find everything up to a 3090ti just about everywhere So if the adapters the 30 series shipped with were as bad as the ones 40 series is shipping we would have heard about this already 4090 didn't even last a week before the adapter burn post began popping up
You're not wrong about the hate boner but Nvidia is big enough to learn from it They also got railed against for the GTX 970 and followed up with the GTX 1070 and 1070 Ti At the end of the day criticism is what pushes these companies to do better Some criticism is noise and some is constructive
I agree you aren t entitled to kindness But being rude will still be perceived as you being a rude person
Well you're not wrong but still For context it was harder for me to seat the 12vhpwr connector on my GPU than it was any other connector on the motherboard That includes the 24 pin connector That wasn't me being derp it's the connector having such a high resistance when trying to plug it in that it genuinely makes a person go Shit I might rip the connector off if I push any harder Ultimately the fault lies in the tolerances of the plug socket in my own opinion It's easy to chalk it up to user error Sure there's a degree of user responsibility involved and people should double check their work you're absolutely right With that said though I definitely think it's a fundamental problem of the design itself I've built almost every desktop I've ever owned going back to the early 00's and I've only ever felt like I might break off the power connector of a GPU during insertion with the 4090 I forced it in because I figured worst case I could just solder a new connector on lol Other people may not be quite so willing to apply excessive force to their 1600 GPU So again this is clearly a bit of column A and a bit of column B Hopefully PCI SIG update the connector and required tolerances in a revision to the connectors to alleviate this going forward
More stating that you are refusing to believe x200B I'm not refusing to believe anything I'm asking you to back up your claims with evidence That's literally the bare minimum anyone should do rather than just blindly believe what they read on the internet Sorry reality isn't just whatever you say it is buddy I'm in touch with reality just not your personal opinion which so far has nothing objective to back it up
It is compatible
Not of this nature its not Its one thing a graphics card not turning on its another with a potential fire hazard
It's not a defect it's a catastrophic failure that leads to a potential fire hazard It's a lot
No I just happened to be unlucky to have 2 cables melted You are ignoring the fact that they both came from Asus and might be part of a batch that is more susceptible You can go back to my original post and look at the pictures I posted everyone stated that the cable was not bent The fact that it would never click despite the pressure I used can tell you that there's something wrong with it Most people believe it or not are not dumb and know how to plug cables
Just stop There is no difference in how any standard works in any industry Just because this was a standard does not mean it would be adopted by anyone Nvidia putting it on their cards scared PSU makers to adopt it under fear of competitors adding it and using it to compete against the ones that did not Nvidia can push any plug they want and everyone will adopt it as long as nvidia sells the most cards
It existed under nvidia before nvidia got it worked in atx 3 0 by leveraging their market control to force it on PSU makers but sTaNdArDs is not an argument and yet it's what you keep saying over and over Since you keep pushing here is the standard you never read it does not require anyone to implement 12vhpwr at all It just defines it for those that want to adopt it You can release an atx 3 0 PSU without these 12vhpwr connectors and still call it atx 3 0 The relevant section is titled PCI Express Add in Card Considerations not requirements On top of that it literally says 12vhpwr is from SIG's PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification Revision 5 0 so intel is telling you it is not their standard right in the document Intel's spec is just a copy and paste of the specs needed for the design of the psu's internals to support it
Do they provide adapters or pawn it off on psu manufacturers It is easy to use a connector when the problematic side is someone else's problem That still does not change that this only was added to the atx spec this year because nvidia pushed it on some 30xx cards and signaled they would use it for more 40xx cards possibly all of them
Idk wether or not anything was vocalized about their store's warranties but at least for their mod mats GN had always offered a warranty Steve mentions this here t 5m30s at 5 33
The thing that got me with GN was that he had never even mentioned anything about warranties on his products until he went after Linus about it He only went after Linus because there was a very vocal community issue with it and quite frankly Linus' warranty being a literal vague trust me bro I got you except when I don't was pretty stupid
you wouldnt lie if it happened to you well you re not one of the ones that it has happened to so this is just whataboutism you are not them and therefore do not know whether they were lying just because you yourself wouldn t lie what a lapse in judgement
Wasn t there a 3090 posted just a few days ago with a burned connector Besides only the FE 30 series cards came with adapters all the partner cards used 6 and 8 pin connectors This generation every 40 series card FE and partner uses an adapter So the number of adapters is way higher this time around
I just read here that nvidia has already sold 100k 4090 s That s a ton right Of 1600 dollar gpus I would imagine they see themselves as doing a lot right if that s the case Last launch people here were non stop raging about the same 3090 s that people are currently patting each other on the back for Go figure
I m sorry that people as dense and stupid as you exist in this world The overwhelming majority of traffic accidents are attributed to user error This is why engineers put in a ton of research and development into planning an architect in these designs so that designs can be intuitive to the overwhelming majority of people So some arrogant schmuck like you doesn t cause an accident even Steve in the video said twice that if the design is unintuitive enough to cause that many errors and catastrophes then there is a flaw in the design itself I don t have to prove to someone that God doesn t exist to say there s a good chance that God doesn t exist I also don t have to prove to you that there have been definitive cases of fully secure video cards becoming unseeded to show a general population of people who openly posted pictures of video cards they believed were properly seated and got destroyed If they believe it was user error they would not have been so tenacious of posting videos of their error This is where common sense should kick him to the average human being Edit I do regret the comment about God as I was using speech to text and was hastily using an analogy Should have contemplated a better one Edit 2 Apparently he wanted the last word as he replied and then blocked me Still leaving my messages for posterity We will see how our comments towards each other hold up a year from now
Congrats It is more than enough for DEEP ROCK GALATIC ROCK AND STONE
Brother you start here and you enjoy it if you're still in the game in a few years you'll be posting your 6090 build and thinking about when you had your old 3050 and it'll be just as cool Happy gaming
I hope you got it for far cheaper price than rx 6600
Build looks nice A PC is a PC whether you have An ATI Radeon 9800 Pro or an RTX 4090 And having built it yourself means you can be all the more proud of it
Not hating on your build or anything but I found it amusing that this post was right underneath yours on my not buy an rtx 3050 new builders please read
Grats on your build I did notice your ram should be in the other 2 slots though B550M DSH recommends using 2nd and 4th when using 2 sticks
I got the same case you can do lots with it don't let the haters knock it
Everyone gets caught up in oh I gotta have the best And they'll rationalize why they need the best when they don't Not that anything is wrong with that for those that have the disposable income But it's good to see the average Joe's getting a rig put together I applaud you on your modest build from an average Joe who is still rocking a 1060 6gb
Got myself a similar 3050 build last month Welcome to the club
First ever BYOPC welcome to the club Isn't the inaugural button push to turn it on exhilarating
Who's everyone My mighty 1050 TI is insulted
Congrats ignore the haters
You do you boo congrats on the new build I just bought a prebuilt this past Aug since I didnt have the time to build spec one out easily I went from an i7 8700 AMD RX580 to an i9 12900KF RTX 3070 MSI 3X Ventus
Grats Not everyone needs or wants the latest and greatest toys As long as you're happy nobody should judge
Good on you Glad to have you enjoying PCs the way they re intended Just the way you want it
The only person that needs to be happy with your build is you Learned that when researching audio equipment and it applies here as well Congrats
gif giphy nbvFVPiEiJH6JOGIok be proud well done
What case is that it looks like clean
Ahaaa I still got ddr3 ram
Hey I just went from a 1650 to a 2060 Little upgrades are still upgrades
Yeah welcome to the 3000 club relieved face I also just got myself a used RTX 3060Ti Dual from palit still on 3 yrs of local distributor warranty Paid for like 267 or Rp 4 1M indonesia currency and it performed really great it even Bottlenecks my 10105F but meh who cares Did sold my 1050 to add up for this so will miss that little beast of mine Actually from 1050 to 1070 but sold it to friend then 2060S and sold ot to friend now 3060Ti well just take 1070 and 2060S as transition gpu that i dont really use at all for holding it for my friend who needs it most rolling on the floor laughing Anyways here's my pc not the best but its my budget build that i built from saving my monthly pocket money and doing some builds and pc fixing things starting from august 2020 till today rolling on the floor laughing width 2268 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s e93ec54abf6791b325899841cdf19899e9cf990a
That case is underrated I know GamersNexus shit on it for poor thermals but I haven't found it to be that much of an issue The big cutout in the back along with the lightweightness and plexiglass makes this a strong contender for lan party use Also supports decent size in terms of GPU
Congrats I was in a similar boat just before the 4090 release where I finally got my old PC working and finally upgraded the old gtx 970 from 2016 to a 3060ti More than happy with it especially since I got it at MSRP Plays everything I want it to more than nicely
Upgraded from my trusty 970 to a 1080 in April 2020 for 350 At this point I just want to see how far this will go My 5800X3D goes in next week
Be glad for what you have and can accomplish Btw congrats on the new build I have this case for about 3 years now and it's one hella good case bur since the side panel is made of acrylic I just left mine opened since day one Incredible amount of space for cable management behind it
Congrats man I started building my first PC with a 1080 and a 50 motherboard months after the 20 series was launched Was never so happy and proud
Very important to live within your means
A 3050 will do for Fortnite etc
bro i got a 750ti
There's NOTHING wrong with this You don't have to pay scalper prices to the GPU god wannabees Plus the savings you net with the 30' card means you have plenty of options for the CPU mobo RAM Well done Now go play with yer new toy
Nice build
Neat
People here forget that the 4090 and 7900XTX cards are top of the line cards not average everyday man cards like I've seen them called
Big achievement there Congrats It's beautiful too beaming face with smiling eyes Will give you hours and hours of joy I'm sure
3050 is a scam card you d get more performance from a 2060
I'm happy for you though it sucks you got stuck with a 3050 and not a better performing but cheaper 2060 or 1650ti if you're not ray tracing
At least ur build dosent melt
a 3050 that's really a thing
And yours is statistically less likely to catch fire
Why get a 3050 If you play at below 4K you would get more performance for cheaper with a 2060
Hey fellow Canadian If it's not too late I highly recommend you return that 3050 ASAP even if there's a restocking fee It's not because it's just weak it's just a significantly terrible value for its price point Like laughably so It's a gimmick card meant to give the impression that you're getting raytracing at a low price However this card will not run anything with raytracing at passable performance And it just sucks by all other metrics too It's easily one of Nvidia's most infamously disappointing and confounding offerings Not sure how much you paid for yours but N 400 CAD plus taxes A GTX 1070 is about 15 faster and you can find those used for 150 200 I'm seeing used RTX 2070 Super for 300 and even RTX 2080 for 350 Super and 550 Ti I've even seen 3060 Ti as low as 420 used There are many other significantly better alternatives Check Facebook Marketplace and Kijiji You can likely negotiate up to 50 off their listed prices A brand new RX 6600 XT is 500 and is 30 faster A brand new RX 6600 is currently 360 on Newegg and even that is significantly better than the 3050 The 3050 is a pariah There's a reason you're getting so much negativity in the comments It's not just elitists dismissing a cheap weak card
3050 sucks sorry
What kind of frames can you get with a 3050 Man anything taxing has to be as slow as balls
and that's why they sell the 3050 people like this buy it OOF
Nice case but the 3050 is ass bruh
LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME I AM IMPORTANT TOO U midway through its lifecycle Then a year later bought a 3090 At the time I bought the 2080 Ti I was rocking 680 SLI setup so the 2080 ti made for a huge leap in both thermals and performance but I wasn't going out of my way to post about it Then I got a 3090 at launch Seeing how upset others were I tried to offer help but people were either butt hurt because they couldn't find one or more 't bring themselves to spend even the MSRP asking price of 1499 let alone the 1930 after tax on a third party model like Asus So I stayed quiet Gloating or humble bragging or whatever it is you are attempting boring That is all
Im selling a 3700x 6700xt build for 700 Congratulations brother
I used this as a server case for a while nice small and compact Even managed to fit a custom loop in there lol width 4032 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s a7abcce8b3e126ceb7c4fa5adbaae14bb1b57a25
Wait theres a 3050 Lol i always thought it starts at 3060
Not complaining your 3050 but that case is a furnace for anything better That should be a priority to upgrade before upgrading your next GPU
But the Rx 6600 would be better at this price point man
Broke boyyy
Why would anyone buy a 3050 when you can get a used 3060ti for 300 n3050 is a garbage card and nobody should ever buy it
Hey My first specifically gaming rig boasted a whole 32MB of SDRAM 32 bit bus 16 channel sound I would have shit myself looking at your rig
Looks real nice and clean dude
2080 for me
I'm still waiting for my 1080
Have fun man
Congratulations man Hopefully by next year I'll also have a nice first build to post in reddit
So I saw someone posted about thermals with that case I have it and had decent luck modding the front intake vents I basically took metal shears and cut large holes large squares for fans to intake air through Seemed to help a ton because I sit at about 72 degrees full load on my GPU temp which is a gtx1080 triple fan I have 2 intake fans on front 1 exhaust on back and the top has my cpu radiator CPU stays frosty never an issue gpu used to spike to 80
Proud of you too bud looks awesome
Good job Congrats on your first PC build It gets more fun every time you do it width 1080 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 9df1cf947dfc47a5df0a78f0e5987ff00d03e0b5
Bros buy used GPUs It is one thing that is totally worth the risk I expect 3000 series become even cheaper since new AMD and Nvidia cards of all types are gonna come out in the next months 3060 3070 they will soon be a great choice for budget gaming
Man's gotta start somewhere my dude my first build was a fully secondhand excluding psu i5 3470 and 1050ti after the first crypto crash I slowly upgraded things and landed myself with a 5900x 4090 system now My old secondhand 1tb HDD from that first build is still inside my case though
I love that case That is full mesh front and top right Also I'm still using a 970 so you've got me beat in power for sure
Aye nice I just built a brand new pc too Fucked up the pins on the cpu and I told myself fuck it this is the time and bought a whole new build 3060 ti with a 5600x amd ryzen on a asus b550 f rog strix 2x16 gb ram and some water cooling to tie it together Oh can t forget the psu Corsair 750w gold First time I ve ever built not super budget Cheers on the new build tho fellow new pc builder width 1284 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s b5ac299ab9d2c4121adb36807d26804601946097
Looks like it turned out nicely At least with your 3050 you don't have to worry about cables melting
I just got the rtx 3060 and I'm so grateful
I'm fond of the amd stock cooler keeps my build surprising cool
Congrats Despite what people say the 3050 is a beast Enjoy your gaming
Nah nah 30 series is superior to the 40 series purely because it's not as much of a fire hazards winking face
I have the same case I love it Got a RTX 3060 and I'm playing at 4K144 yes it really works just turn a few settings down
I thought about 3050 but then realized that price gap between 3050 and 3060 is quite smaller than performance difference so now I'm looking for 3060
congrats even 3070 is quite pricey I've been eyeing a 3060 since that is the only reasonable price
H you can still have a baller time with more budget hardware you dont need an i9 and a high end 30 40 series card to have fun and you can always invest money later if you are finding more use out of your hardware ive been playing a ton of indie type games that can run on lower end hardware put a crapload of hours in vampire survivors project zomboid and other games this year and had a blast meanwhile my VR hardware hasnt been used much which is what my build is for Go figure
No reason not to be proud on your good looking build Congrats
I just got myself a 3080 ti too recently and gratz
Thats a nice budget case Cooler master Q300L
You re not any less a part of PCMR May you beat many bosses on your new 3050
That Q300L case looks great and I would love to have side front I O
I have that same case
I have this case too
Have fun with your new PC Sorry to say this but you installed the ram in the wrong slots move them both one to the right to get the most performance out of it Happy gaming
And here I am still using my
Looking good king
Amen brother
Ooo Ikea uppspel I have too gl with gpu
I gamed with used gear for 10 years before i bought my first brand new graphics card Built my credit up Got credit cards to put the new graphics card on so they wouldn't be such a hit to the bank account Extended my career to make more money but the best thing i did want having any soul sucking money pit children Lol im selfish Fuck those brats Congrats man
Nice and clean build congratulations bro have a lot of fun with it Also the 3050 should be enough for more than anything
What case is this
width 619 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s a61121643a1d338d504aa37e85564e8113ae21df 1660 super OK hand
How much did you pay for 3050
If the build you have plays your games at 60 fps and at least 1080p 1440p in my opinion that's perfectly fine to enjoy games I started with a budget build I know many people that still have budget builds and they don't enjoy games any less than people with 3080's and such
Congratulations Two days ago I finally bought online all the components for a 3060 Ti build and I'm super excited as well
Man I loved that case it was my first build and It absolutely sucked for airflow but man I still love that case
That's a cool case
You go my man
Enjoy it brother You don't need 40 series to just play games
Used that car for my grandpa's old computer I built for him who passed away in Jan His old car was dirty and disgusting cats I3 4130 system Runs like a champ still but back in 2013
Hey I am proud of you too
it's a lovely build to be honest i mostly play csgo so i like pc builds that can provide solid fps on fhd monitor
Comparison is the thief of joy Enjoy your shit you earned it
I used to have that case Nice build
Still an excellent graphics card Any gpu is good as long as it fits your needs
Congrats on your first build The spec is to make you happy not just fastest and latest while you don t make use of its power
Looking sharp
And you should be Happy gaming
Who needs a 4080 90 anyway Congrats on your build have fun
This is how I felt during the new RTX days with my 1060 3gig
Well done You don't need a 40 series to be happy or even to to game Enjoy
And a Q500L too Great little case there s nothing like it
Congratulations and enjoy good times are coming
Congrats Build looks good Don't measure against others you're in for some great times
Im still rocking a 2060S that i got on a steal during the shortage lol
Great build does your system run on Dual Channel If not put the memory sticks into slot 2 and 4 as this is recommended for AM4 and modern platforms in general
Congrats I've got a GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3050 OC 8GB and it does everything I need and then some Ran FurMark for about 2 hours and stayed at 120 fps with an overclock I prefer performance over graphics for games like Warzone 2 0 so I tend to turn down my graphics settings to where I get a stable 130fps If you're okay with sacrificing some graphics settings depending on the game here and there for performance then you'll love it I also run Skyrim SE with 101 mods consisting of some very heavy graphics overhauls and a mod that unlocks the frame limit where I can run a stable 160 fps with the game's highest graphics settings 3050s are a great value for money it'll serve you well
Everybody has to start somewhere brother The first PC I built had a Celeron 300a 464mhz 128MB 100mhz SDRAM ABIT BH6 and a Diamond TNT2 32mb AGP 4X All budget parts at the time TNT2 was by far the best part I was 16 years old and saved for 1 5 years to buy it There are not many feelings in life better than the feeling of saving and finally getting what you want Enjoy it Doesnt matter what other people have
Me in a 's fine I barely play and when I do is either the Switch the Steam Deck or some low graphics
Congratulation welcome to the club
Anyone who bought a 4090 is a moron
That was my first case I had I still have it I loved it tbh Little tight quarters but it is a mini atx Looks good btw
I completely understand In november of 2019 I was broke and did all I could to scrounge up money to put together a gaming pc It took me 4 months and I was able to build a ryzen 5 3600 2070 super build I started saving money immediately after building it and because of that I now have a 4090 5950x build If you keep saving money every week starting now in two years you'll probably have a 15900k 5090 build
I have the same case since yesterday But a i5 10400F and a GTX
Congrats on your new build I think im good with my RTX 3080ti im not looking to have and 8k monitor until maybe 6 to 7 years from now
I want to update my 5600g APU with 3050 but I'm worried about overheating How many fans it has CPU has default fan Temperature when playing
Congratulations I know the feel My first build as a 970 when it launched I was so happy and looking forward to play Witcher 3 That thing lasted for ages just changed it this year Now a 3050 is like a 2060 And you have dlss That thing will keep you so happy for a long time Welcome to PC gaming friend
Ooh I really like that case What is it
Nvidia let's see a new GPU for less than 300 soon or you will lose people like this
I hope u bought it for cheap because in my country difference in price between 3050 and 3060 is non existent and 3060 ti is near but destroys both cards
It s not how big it is it how you use it grinning face with smiling eyes
Don t get it twisted Most people do not have 4000 series cards
Ayyyee this was my wife s first case too Trust you don t need to have a 4090 build right off the bat Work your way up and replace parts as needed I won t from a fx9590 and crossfire Rx 480s to what I have now over the last like 4 5 years It s cathartic upgrading over time
I m still pushing a 1060 Everyone makes fun of me but I can play every single game just fine so what s the issue
Well my friend you're way ahead of me I'm sitting here looking at a Zotac 4090 I managed to buy second hand for MRSP 1600 but have yet to acquire many other parts My dumbass decided to start building my first PC around Christmas time Needless to say the rest of the build is on hiatus 'till I survive the holiday shopping period While you're gaming with high settings and refresh rates on your just 3050 I'll be lucky to actually put the damn thing together before February Congrats and good job
Hope your roommate doesn't throw it down the stars
I love that case I've built PCs in it a few times and it's one of my favorites
Hey awesome build You should feel really proud it's not easy to save up all that money and spend it on something you've never done before glad it worked out
1070 best gpu
Looks almost exactly like my first build Other than the graphics card I had a 1660 Super in mine
Proud of you Let's FKN GO
Hey we have the same case And very identical looking mobo s what one do you have
Gtx gamers assemble here I got a 1060 6gb
I've been there first build was a Core I3 with a 2gb 960 could barely afford that at the time but damn did I make it work Played the hell out of that build and lasted years
Congrats but you should have gotten a 6650xt The 3050 is not good enough for raytracing at all even with DLSS and it s significantly worse that the 6650xt while costing more
Lot of hate on the case online but I have one and it great
i m proud of you
The funny part about people buying the 4XXX series is at the end of the day they play pixel art games and not even triple AAA games with good graphics
Hey I have the same case D congrats with the build
Great starter case Cheap and tons of airflow
Lets bring realistic goals back for the lower class am i right Help the people nvidia
I am proud of you too stranger I hope you have a lot of fun with it much love
3050 is a solid card congrats
Gigabyte UD boards are the best boards I've owned Enjoy
I am also proud of you
Honestly I don't understand why It's not that it's bad it's just bad value You can get a 2060 12gb or even a 2060 6gb for less An RX 6600 XT second hand 2070 The 3050 Is not as cheap as it should be for me to consider
The 40 series is such overkill for what I want to do 30 series will be good for years based on my giant backlog of Steam titles it's ludicrous
You Should be proud of yourself
Nice set up
Looks nice
I started with an i3 6100 and a R9 390 while everyone else was out buying a 1080 Ti Good times congrats on the first build it's satisfying when it just works after saving and building
It's not about getting the best ever ts about getting the best for you Good on you You should be proud
Nice rig enjoy the hell out of it
I still got a 2060 it does everything I need to do Congrats tho good job on saving your money
You are no alone I buy 3070 asus KO and love it for 2k monitor 27 I don't want to have problems with new connector smelting new series 40
Congrats on your build And I hope yet another day that my 980ti wont die from seeing these posts
Congrats on the new build I remember the days of playing on my old GTX 650 I think a large portion of my total gaming hours were spent on that system and I loved it
Amen You've achieved a 's what it's all about
And But congratulations brow
Nice build especially the case I used the same case for my brother's pc and it's phenomenal
And you will probably enjoy it twice as much good for you dude
Is there still a 2070 club asking for a friend
Congratulations buddy clapping hands
Seems OK for AAA 1080 v rwbd2 bGi04 Might have gone for a 3060 but it'll do especially with some DLSS FSR v jFs06uoKIA
My first ever build I forgot to put the IO shield on and everything was connected this was back in the days of Sata cables everywhere so I just called it extra
Congrats man This case is amazing My last build was in this case Have fun
Welcome to the club The 3050 is a great 1080p card We've come a far way in graphics that a 3050 can comfortably handle 1080p The 8GB VRAM is the cherry on top
Nice build I had that mb once good workhorse and generally a good build for 1080p gaming
Bought myself the 3080 today With ryzen 9 9500x corsair 32gb 4000mhz finally Have been waiting a few years Nice build the 3050 is also very good I almost bought it too but I waited to scratch some more cash together
congrats but the 3050 is overpriced would personally get the RX 6600 XT
I wouldn't call 160k people in the world everyone
3050 I m still out here with my 1660 skull
Congratulations on the build what are you most excited to get into
No reason not to be proud congrats
Bro I have one of the this and it s looks like a oven same having a Aorus water cooler and isn t Core I9 is a Core I5
This your first build Congratulations man Welcome to the wonderful and sometimes expensive world of PC building Working with new and expensive parts is great and all but for me scavenging used parts on Craigslist FB marketplace is what makes it more fun for me Nothing like building a bad ass gaming PC on the cheap
Congrats on your first build partying face and warmest of welcomes to the PC community
D RDO and
Might want to keep the dust filters off the case for airflow Gratz
Did you got any trouble installing the drivers I got an 3060Ti and windows crashes when installing the driver Nvidia 526 98 the latest I any help over here might as well return it T T
my watercooled rtx 4090 almost teared up a little
I have that same electronic screwdriver lol
Very nice
And I can guarantee you'll enjoy it just as much if not even more than people with their new hardware Goodluck and have fun
As you should be
hey if its a clean build it gest my respect
Same I just bought a used 10700 and used 3070 and am really happy with it
Awww its soo cute
Dude I'm using an overclocked 980 ti face with tears of joy
Pretty sweet man I like the case
And you should be proud If we compare ourselves to those who have more we will always fall short Be happy with what you have
I just built myself a PC with a 3070
I'm still waiting for my 4090 backordered ugh I need to feel the power Roblox will run soooo much better flexed bicepssign of the horns
That GPU is gonna rock The Division 1 2 and that s all that matters
I'm scraping my monies together for a 3060 Ti Gotta do what you can with what you got
same here a 3060 more then enough for me
Good price to performance motherboard I have it also with an RTX 3060ti
Thanks this was my very first ever build and all the parts and cables seemed daunting at first but it came together pretty easily
Unofficially named the no one told us about rx6600 club
It seems they got an upgrade
Rock and Stone everyone
How come this game is now being mentioned everywhere Was there a big update or is it twitch fame
Whose throwing barrels into the launch pad
Thanks man I'm very surprised by the performance Reviews had been saying everything from good for budget to avoid at all costs but using fortnite as a test bench for RTX it actually manages around 50 60 fps with max settings max rtx and DLSS As for the 6090 unfortunately if Nvidia continues their ways with the 40 series onto the 50 and 60 it'll be an RX9950XT for me
Unlikely
If you have a 9800 pro you're in for a bad time In the course of about 1 year I had 4 fans die Would recommend upgrading to an BFG Tech 8800 GTX
Loll it's fine I understand that the 3050 wasn't the best choice but I had to go with it if I wanted a system now because of local stock issues I don't order electronics online anymore after
Same thing on my feed lol
Ah I thought it was A1 and B1 I was following along to a YouTube guide that said that's how it's done
I ll second this I just built into one this weekend and have used it for about 5 other builds Airflow is not as bad as people say It seems the naysayers lose sight of the key word s budget builds
The 1060 is fucking legendary Pascal has insane longevity
I put my old 1060 into my wife's PC It performs without issue for everything she plays Pascal is awesome
It was 't post lol
1050Ti gang rise up Even though I'm in the process of making a new build rn
1650 Super going strong
I also bought a prebuilt in August Went from having no computer for the last 5 years to a I7 12700f RTX 3060 msi ventus 2x oc Debating getting a used 3070 for 350cad or maybe a 3080 used for 600 But also just debating buying a new 3090 ti evga for like 1300 I'll probably end up just using the 3060 for the next year or two and just save up for a 7900xt tho lol Really games already look so good on this mid range card compared to all my old console experiences
Cooler Master Master box Q300L picked up 2 of these on Amazon last week for only 42 Now 67 not worth that much imo I'm sure they'll be back on sale by next weekend
At the moment it seems to get decently toasty under load but nothing crazy or dangerous
It s good but it kinda fell apart after 3 years and I ve been cleaning it at least every three months and taking proper care of it The magnet strips detached from the filters itself the power button stopped working properly the second USB port on the case stopped working Other than that it s been good easily portable can fit surprisingly big cards while also fitting I think I have 7 fans inside at the moment a 120x2 aio top intake fans 1 exhaust two front and one bottom intake and a fan that fit snugly right in front of the ssd holder so all that and having the A c on when playing games help with cooling
I agree the case is great I put together a simple build for my wife and the case was super easy to work with I had zero issues The thermals are fine as well As long as you're arent hard core OC'ing in it you'll be fine
I think the one that GN reviewed is the 500QL instead of this 300QL The 300QL still has small amount of ventilation but isn't missing 2 140mm fan spots so its fine
I have a similar story People were telling me to wait for RTX 4000 but I went ahead and replaced my 1060 6GB with a 3060 Ti because I had a feeling the new cards would be too expensive
I'm playing a plague tale requiem at high settings with an average of around 50fps For a story based game it works fine
1650 ti are only for mobile GPUs do you mean 1660 ti
Here in the land of igloos and Tim Hortons anything above a 10 series is very high price if you're looking at used and it's quite difficult to find any 20 series cards new at a decent price For my use case this thing will do just fine
Lol Nvidias not been doing too well with the 40 series launch huh
Yeah The first 50 series rtx card they've made
I know But I have no money and I'm only playing at 1080p so it's fine by me
Objectively true
People have this strange idea that entry level cards can't do shit So far I can play the most demanding titles at medium high settings just fine assuming 1080p You just gotta level your expectations
has a 6800xt decides to shit on people for having lower end cards
it's amaazing how you can criticize someone for doing something you're clearly projecting onto them all the while preaching your own virtue and painting yourself as a martyr LOL
I'm not gloating This computer is nothing to brag about I'm just proud of myself and want to share
One word Seething
Thanks Let's just not talk about the cables hidden on the other side of the case
Yeah so with just the regular exhaust fan my cpu reaches an insane 90c Did some undervolting and got that down to 75 Looks like an intake fan is in order for me
What size radiator did you install up there
Planning on using my Envy 700s too
It is front and top mesh yeah but the mesh is actually super restrictive
Just go for RX 6650XT or 6700XT at that point 6650XT is around 350 and 6700XT is 420ish Nvidia cards are simply bad value at their current prices
I know the 6600 6650 is better but saying this card cannot do RT at all is false Ultra settings without DLSS RT set to high 56fps avg width 1917 format png auto webp v enabled s 995a9508f411a34dfebe53d053708feed62bd360
Ryzen 5 5600g
Lots of games the old dell workstation I played on was capable of most games but nothing crazy performance wise So far many games have triple the performance owing a lot to the cpu actually
As long as you do it faster than 3 days you re smarter than me
curious why not an RX 6600
First ever build was in this case I missed the simplicity Nice build
Or 5600 xt 1660s 1660ti I mean if OP is happy that's all that matters really but damn if they paid more than like 150 they got scammed
Does rx6600 has DLSS
Did I hear a Rock and Stone
FOR KARL
It's a really good coop game Community's nice too Most of em
A few YouTubers with lots of followers have covered it recently It's a banging game and deserves all the green beards it can get
It's been a cult classic and critic fan favorite since release but yes a couple big influencers started talking about it recently Season 3 either just released or is about to
Hahahahaha I don't blame you I'm cautiously hoping for a future where we're not stuck on crazy upgrade cycles What I optimistically hope for though is we keep getting good games to get wrapped up and good options to suit our needs I'm glad you're getting solid performance While I'm here I wanna make a small recommendation for risk of rain 2 A game that will run like butter until you're in your 4th hour in the run and can barely see what's happening on screen anymore
Ray tracing is overrated lol but the DLSS on a entry level card helps push frames a lot
SPURN NVIDIA EMBRACE AMD
I dunno my HIS 9800pro IceQ lasted a 4ish years before it died
Just as a rule of thumb for NVIDIA always go for the x6xx class or better
Yeh I wasn't exactly sure but thought it looked odd Downloaded the manual for that board and section 1 4 lists to use A2 and B2 Welcome to computer building where logic isn't always right Lol
It's pretty much always A2 and B2 but you should check your motherboards manual to be sure
Yep the airflow is not that bad it can be vastly improved by cutting out the holes for fan which I did However the size of this case is a great middle ground btw regular mid towers and ITX builds I would highly recommend it for anyone that loves DIY builds
You'll get past that one day I promise Both your first power on POST rate and the ability to immediately deal with the problem if it doesn't POST first time
1650 here as well
My old PC was working but I had to downscale games to 1080p so that my frames would be 60FPS or more without image quality and stutters ruining gaming exp It was hard to not be able to use my 1440p 144Hz monitor to the max on newer triple A games Honestly though 3060 or 3070 more than enough for 1080p and most 1440p resolution gaming glad you got a new pc after like 5 yrs D when I went from PS4 30 frames gaming to my old pc I couldn't go back I'd get headaches trying to play at 30fps again Now on my new PC I'm able to crank the graphics to 1440P ultra settings and still get 140 FPS easy
What processor you got in there
Most of this sounds easily fixable Even then this case can be had for 42 when on sale what a steel id say
Yeah I had thought about going down that route too but I knew the new cards were going to be way out of my price range and I was right
What resolution Interested how your 3050 compares to my 3060 I also was playing plague tale the other night
yes
Personally I am wishing I could swap my 3080 for a 3090 now that 10GB is starting to run out but fuck me all the used 3090's are still 1200 CAD or higher
Ye I purchased a computer recently and was suprised how expensive computer stuff is in Canada especially the GPU's
Don t know what you mean the launch was fire
You could have been better off spending the same money on 2060 or 6600xt with 30 performance gain
It's because 1080p isn't really 's the barebone resolution of gaming these
My 450 2020 Inspiron 3593 can run a large Roblox file at max settings 768x432 obviously not best of the best but certainly bang for the buck
Nyeh you should have gotten a 3060 that's all
Its old And no I never went out explicitly looking for votes But this is next level desperate
keep gloating
Keep Seething
Haha I used to have a wrx I drive a 540xi now
I had some from my old case I thru into this one Good luck I wanted to make some videos for this case I modded never got to it though
240mm Edit just realized my flair ignore whatever it says currently that s my old build
What if they prefer NVidia cards
What is that Forza
Well I got back from Memory Express at about 7 30 took out my old pre built office PC's drives as soon as I got back Then for the first 15 or so minutes things were going smoothly until one of the cases standoff screws broke under the motherboard preventing me from putting any more screws in Spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get it 't align with the screw holes on the case unless I held it in place while screwing it in Took ages After that I forgot to plug in some of the PSU cables The plugs on the mobo were covered by my gpu so I had to get that out again Then the back breaking bending to get them all 't it was around 2am
No stock available at a reasonable price in my region Ended up just going into memoryexpress in person and having a look at what they had Walked away with a 3050
I don't know why you got downvoted The RX 6600 is better than the 3050 9 times out of 10 while being cheaper
Or an ARC GPU They seem really good If you're not in to old games that is In Europe at least the 770 was going as low as 300 something euros
No but DLSS is pretty useless at 1080p anyway 720p base resolution is too low
To the bone
This and probably because the game went on sale for 10 on Steam a few days ago
Heard of it but never played is that a game mechanic or a bug
I was about to say raytracing is super awesome but my dumbass didn t realize you were talking about Fortnite
If you re playing fortnite just play max view distance epic maybe textures anti aliasing is personal preference and then everything else low or off
My brain went to Kwest shudders
You thinking of amd What Nvidia card has a 6 there
5600g
The filters were fixable but the USB port and power button issue still isn t fixed I took apart the piece containing the buttons to see whether something was just unseated but there was no visible issue and then reseated the cable that connected to the motherboard Also changing motherboards didn t fix it so it couldn t have been that
1080p putting dlss on quality can bring the average up above 60
Best I could recently find is a new 3090ti for 1350 cad Little more then i can afford tho Well maybe a lil more then a lil lol
And is still the most commonly used by a long shot according to steam stats OP will be fine until ready to upgrade in a couple years
I bought a 3060 and people says that I must bought a 3060 ti xD
stop projecting
Well then you probably buy the worse value card
Yeah built in benchmark
Lol my first build took
Much smoother than my first build brother Night and day I quite literally installed my CPU cooler completely backwards Slot 1 CPU If I didn't notice it I would have fried the CPU completely when I went to boot it up
Honestly I did a build for a friend in that case a couple years ago and it's pretty shit even for the cost It's functional and there's no reason to hate it but it also isn't well put together and the filter system is a bit crap I couldn't get the sides to stop sliding off every time I moved it or something You've done well on your first build to do it in that case without more issues than that lol
Memory express is The home country of ATI doesn t have Radeon RX 6600s
You should had waited for black friday It's borderline dumb to spend money on 3050 now when you are gonna regret it next friday lol
If the man wanted Nvidia just let him fucking be
But if they plan on streaming recording NVECN is still way better last I checked
It may be objectively better 9 times out of 10 but the 10th counts Not cheaper everywhere just on average
Its a solid game with almost no bugs in my experience Basically by the later stages there's so much shit happening on screen and so many effects that it just turns into a slide show I think its very funny though I know games can get annoying when it gets choppy but that deep in a run it'll just feel like you're gambling I wish I could say more but you just gotta check out some videos and get around to playing it Preferably with some good friends Its a blast
The pros play with everything low or off except epic view distance it s the best way to play and you don t miss anything having smoother play DLSS will let you push 144fps in FN with a 3050 my laptop 3050ti does it and a desktop 3050 probably faster
16 series cards like my 1660super
I messed it up I meant xx6x 3060 2060 1660 960 etc 5 cards suck for gaming but technically work 6 is the budget option that s decent 7 is mid range and 8 9 are high end
Fantastic part I used to have one Great performance What games you playing with your new system
A b550 aorus or Strix or Gaming AC mobo would work wonders if you plan to overclock down the road
Play a bit with the case fan curves in BIOS as a start then you can try to undervolt your GPU and CPU it helps a lot with no noticable loss of performance sometimes even some gains if you experience thermal throttling I always undervolt my GPUs and it does wonders Edit Ah also don t forget about the fan curves for your CPU and GPU
They'd have to think about the used market at length
6600 6600XT are cheaper new as well
Lol yep i got a 3060 as well and thats the senitment shoulda bought a 3060ti But really pretty impressed with the card still
Stop being a baby
There are also valuable features say Ray Tracing its not just performance per dolar thats important
Yea so it s not tracing any rays Only the ultra and extreme Ray tracing setting for RT trace rays in gameplay The other RT settings only trace rays in Forza vista photo mode Run the benchmark on RT ultra post again Better yet run a benchmark in cyberpunk and post again I have a 3080 and I consider that utterly useless for RT 1280x720 828x466 filters focal 640x360 641x361 format webp
Let's hope so because I'm building my brother a PC for xmas this year
Nope Only Nvidia in this store width 3024 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s b53a52155496f602117d3ba8a13432efb61591af
It was on black Friday sale already
All he asked was a question though And it's a simple Google search to pull up benchmark comparisons for the most popular games out Just like with the RX 580 being legitimately faster than the GTX 1060 and being cheaper the 580 still sat on shelves due to just overwhelming market share and the weird stigma against Radeon cards For pure gaming at this price point and no bias for sub 300 there's an objective choice and a subjective choice
With this class of GPU those are not even legitimate factors It's not like the encoder on Radeon cards are as bad compared to RX 5000
Is there anything lower Haha He meant 1060 had the 6 in the wrong spot
That's true the 3060ti is best ti improvement for the 30 series its actually pretty close to the 3070 a good budget option
Lots of games but right now I'm playing through a plague tale requiem forza horizon 5 ark survival and subnautica
There was a few different available presets and a custom option when I first started it up but I decided not to mess with it and left it on default values No thermal throttling but it gets a little loud and the gpu gets up to around 75c under load I'll probably order some extra case fans as well
Now we're tracing with rays width 1917 format png auto webp v enabled s 078f28ec91f253514c9b4fcda6f49feaa5488cec
Then you need to join bapcsalecanada subridit When parts n stuff come in sale people post there Its how I got my last graphics card
It 100 does Haha my first build ever I had that itch and couldn't bear waiting so I started at 10pm that night thinking it'd be quick but because if unforeseen circumstances not posting I finished at 5 am grinning face with sweat
Lies i see a Intel arc up there haha
Uh call me new fashioned but what about online
Holy shit an arc card lol
Guy is an asshole Enjoy your build
Then you could had bought 3060 or 6600 3050 is waste of sand honestly worst card you can buy
Dude people can have preferences You cannot force people to buy certain brands regardless off price or performance Some people just trust and prefer Nvidia and if we talk about some features plus software quality and simplicity they have all the reason to choose nvidia Let people be if they willing to pay a premium price to get what they want lol You AMD guys on reddit has no difference than 'Would you like to listen a message from our lord and savior Jesus ' guys In every god damn build post in any sub there is at least one man who says 'Why didn't you buy xxxx AMD card ' Just holly hell why do you even care
Stigma
For streaming specifically it's significantly worse with h264 on AMD it's blurrier and blockier h265 is good and AV1 is revolutionary anyway But most people still use h264
75c is not bad for an air cooled GPU But I would be more worried about the CPU with that cooler how s that running
Also it won t hurt to still undervolt the GPU at least it will get a bit quieter it s an easy process
Thanks for sharing that Something is definitely off with those benchmarks Maybe it wasn t changed to reflect the new settings in the new Forza patch The Rtx 3060 on the raytracing extreme setting in gameplay will hover around 60ish fps in the day time There s no way in gameplay without DLSS the 3050 should be averaging 54fps if raytracing is on The 3050 is slower than the 6600xt at raytracing and amd has bad raytracing so those numbers are suspect
Nice As a fellow 3050 owner I may not have updated my flair but that's about it there's a bunch of things I'll suggest which is relatively coarse and doesn't do anything to vegetation You may want to consider switching to TAA or DLAA and adjusting sharpness Feel free to increase environment texture quality to Extreme as long as you don't also set environment geometry to extreme There's enough video RAM to hold the best textures and Extreme textures do improve distant trees' appearance Trees tend to be simplified when not running at Extreme geometry and at lower texture settings they look like N64 trees SSAO at High sometimes exhibit blocking artifacts or in the back end of the benchmark Turn it off or to Ultra to either remove AO or remove the artifacts the settings after car detail aside from ray tracing don't seem to have much practical effect to my eyes Feel free to drop them to High and check your frame rates Enjoy your new video card and FH5
If it's their first build they might have felt safer buying local where they can return things very quickly and easily
You're a prick Piss off
Did you forget the 1630 and 6400 exist lol
well they didn't post pricing so we don't know for sure but rtx 3050 is equivalent to gtx 1080 which more than covers minimum requirements for every game released and announced so far
Not forcing anything You AMD guys on reddit has no difference than 'Would you like to listen a message from our lord and savior Jesus ' guys Don't really have any allegiance but you definitely don't seem to like hard evidence Don't care who buys what it makes sense to know what it is
Again gaming and streaming on either card is worthless If 3050 is 20 25 slower in games on average tell me the practicality of losing even more perfomance to use h264 You won't sustain that high of frame rate either way you go about it
Strangely enough I can't tell Speccy CPUZ and Nvidia experience all report the CPU as AMD K16 and no temperatures The BIOS reports it correctly though and assuming from fan speeds I'd say maybe around 60c
I'm sorry but you're just spewing bullshit now The 6600xt is brought to its knees with rt because it lacks tensor and rt cores instead just using the shitty ray accelerators amd has Just say the performance is surprising and move on there's no need to call out good performance because you have a grudge against certain hardware
I've played hundreds of hours of fh5 on the old Dell workstation I had before this I'm practically a master of tinkering with settings I can tell exactly what platform and settings someone is playing when watching videos of the game at a glance lmao I noticed at high and below geometry quality tesselation is completely disabled which looks pretty awful and vegetation uses a 2d billboard shading at ultra enables physically based rendering and extreme enables cone step mapping the car quality during the loading screen is always set to extreme and so much more
6500 XT too
3050 is on a 1070 level kinda so while it performed nearly the same 3050 are still better powered rolling on the floor laughing
Evidence of what What are you even talking about
They'll prolly be playing esport titles in which they won't be GPU limited so the extra 5 10 load of streaming won't be an issue
Entirely depends on the game You're not meant to run cyberpunk 2077 at ultra high settings on a 3050 or rx6600 anyway
NVENC's performance tax is around 2 and it looks good enough even with 3000 bitrate A good reason to get a low end NVIDIA GPUs instead of AMD is to get access to NVENC Its the basic hardware recommendation for low budget streaming
Weird maybe you need to update to a newer BIOS that would be my first guess You can also try Ryzen Master since it s a dedicated software for Ryzens
2 of those are trash programs CPU Z doesn't show temps its not for that Especially get rid of GeForce Experience though Use DDU to unistall your driver then use NVCleaninstall to reinstall the latest driver After that use HWInfo64 That is the ONLY program you should ever use for monitor your system Nothing else compares
Nice to learn another thing Though I guess my eyes aren't that good since looking at the benchmark in motion I couldn't really tell the shader quality difference or they're probably just that good out of the box And yeah environment geometry below Ultra looks quite 's a distracting amount of pop in IME I ended up choosing the settings as I see fit to minimize artifacts while practically staying around 60 fps in most races it does dip slightly during nighttime street races when there's a lot of AI cars around but it's not worth dinging the quality in other situations IMO
This one too Not the best even as budget gaming gpus
Tom's Hardware ranks it between 1070 Ti and 1080
Dude people can have preferences You cannot force people to buy certain brands regardless off price or performance Some people just trust and prefer Nvidia and if we talk about some features plus software quality and simplicity they have all the reason to choose nvidia Let people be if they willing to pay a premium price to get what they want lol You AMD guys on reddit has no difference than 'Would you like to listen a message from our lord and savior Jesus ' guys In every god damn build post in any sub there is at least one man who says 'Why didn't you buy xxxx AMD card ' Just holly hell why do you even care There's no point in me going further with this Your little rant can be easily applied to Nvidia enjoyers What were you thinking when you made your last reply And all of this is from a question so I have no idea why you're pressed I'm just here watching a movie
Dude is a dick I'm with you just let the guy be
So people are really going to pay 100 200 more for NVENC On budget cards towards buyers who usually don't stream or don't care to And just deal with the 20 25 performance gap Really Im at a lots for words now with this logic If the bit rate is low enough it's negligible Also what about when you're not streaming
Yeah about ryzen master that doesn't install It just says Upgrade Failed and closes with nothing else I'll keep trying
Dude I literally see nobody doing that on Nvidia side in reddit Where are this Nvidia enjoyers who spams 'Why didn't you buy Nvidia instead of AMD ' or 'You should buy Nvidia instead of AMD ' in pc build threads There is a legimate hate boner against Nvidia on Reddit in pretty much every pc related sub that includes Nvidia's own sub I gave a rant because I kinda got bored of AMD bringed up in pretty much every thread non related Just let people buy what they want stop preaching about how they should buy AMD Anyways Have a nice day
100 percent this
Mind bottling really
Update your BIOS to the latest one specified on your MOBO support page it might be outdated also download the latest chipset drivers from AMD
these comments do not represent Corsair as a company The guy making the comments was the pinnacle of his department
I was wondering how they'd respond as it was a pretty bad screw up lol Looks like that one person probably lost their job for popping off Still doesn't change the fact that all of their special replacement cables now limit the 4090 to 450w
Tech Jesus will forgive all PC sins
Because the engineers don't know how to talk to the customer's
Okay at risk of sounding like JonnyGuru and eventually proving myself an idiot when I'm proven wrong I'm seeing a lot of questions about the same thing and also quite a bit of speculation and misinformation So here's a bit of a primer on these cables and how they set the power limit TL DR This 3 pin limiting you to 450W business only applies to Nvidia's own adapter cable which includes adapter cables supplied with AIB cards It does not apply to any third party cables including Corsair's Seasonic's Asus's or random Amazon adapter cables The 12VHPWR cable has four sideband pins for communication two of which S3 and S4 are for defining power limits Depending on the configuration that they're grounded or left open in they can let the GPU know hey this cable can supply 150W 300W 450W 600W and the GPU will know not to exceed that limit To signal that a cable is capable of 600W both S3 and S4 need to be grounded If the 4090 reads this configuration it knows it can get 600W and unlocks the power slider to 133 Now here's where people are getting tripped up Nvidia's cable is smart It's not just a passive adapter cable it has a chip in the connector that senses how many power cables are connected and then selectively grounds S3 S4 to configure either a 450W or a 600W power limit Third party cables don't have that chip However this does NOT mean they can't do 600W The easiest way to enable 600W is simply to hardwire both of those pins to ground which is how Corsair Seasonic etc are doing it Those cables are set to 600W permanently which potentially presents a problem as the 4090 will read I have 600W available even if you've plugged your cable into a 550W PSU But if you do your due diligence and only plug the cable into a 1000W 1200W PSU that can safely supply the 600W necessary then the card will be able to draw 600W So then the other question becomes how are they supplying 600W over only 2 or 3 connectors But that question's honestly been beaten to death so I won't bother answering it in detail here the short of it is that each 8 pin connector is electrically rated to supply up to around 300W give or take and the 150W limit is entirely artificial So you can chill out your Corsair Seasonic Asus cable marked 600W is still 600W The difference is that it's permanently 600W unlike Nvidia's which will configure itself to the number of connectors you connected
The question
Nobody fucks with GN and gets away with it They are The Gold Standard
They or said employee should have known before going after our Lord Savior tech Jesus
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I remember JonnyGuru wrote something like When poked I do bite in his signature on forums I guess he just bit himself lmfao
I kinda laughed when I saw that part of the video when Steve had an actual former Nvidia engineer recently have been promoted explaining things on camera Also it s kinda funny to see GN s antics on here and YouTube when I m walking distance from their studio I m honestly tempted to just walk over and say hi
The guy we pay to represent the company doesn t actually represent the company
We should put the blame in the right place Nvidia is very likely the source of all the confusion GN interviewing the right ex nvidia engineer doesn't mean nvidia hasn't sent out poor documentation to companies in the industry I would bet corsair was completely caught off guard because nvidia dropped the ball
LOL no one's going to fire good ol' jonnyGURU
I just love how GN was like Yo Corsair Hold that fact check really quick
Did not know who it was fucking with
I have decided to boycott their bullshit products
Well in all fairness Steve at GN flat out donkey punched them with accuracy Corsair didn't have a choice
Johnnyguru looks to have an ego All these years of being hailed as the psu guru have appeared to have gone to his head With an ego like that Corsair won t need to remind Jonny on how to behave He ll just leave Corsair And Corsair might be better off for it
Imagine trying to go full Faux News on Gamers Nexus smh someone s will definitely have lost their job over that lol
After reading his comments this entire thing looks like a joke If he is wrong that's ok But this has been overblown into a full fledge tragedy
He s not the Messiah he s a very naughty boy
yeah I'd be blowing sunshine up everyone's ass considering how Steve disproved that whole post in like fifteen seconds of video time I have recently started actually viewing the Gamer's Nexus content but they still have every bit of my trust in what they say
I wish GN would also be less inflamatory towards Intel and Nvidia
Corsair has an internal culture problem On one hand they talk about how they Love gamers On the other hand they sue Valve for millions because they had buttons on the back of a controller Also their department leads do this towards journalism
Tech Jesus knows his stuff
Having read the whole thing the guy acted a bit silly but JonnyGuru didn't really do anything too terrible Certainly nothing warranting the absurd apology posted above And frankly I can understand his frustration with Nvidia once he found out that he didn't actually have a complete picture of the specifications for the card Calling Nvidia ass clown moose fuckers is totally warranted and absolutely hilarious Nvidia makes amazing technology has brilliant engineers and cuda is a great framework but as companies go they're becoming ever more douchetastic as time progresses
Link to original tweet s 20 t CyRw96XMWuoOHj3w3dJp5w
lol I bought the 600 watt cable adaptor and shipped yesterday Just my luck lol thought I was doing good finally caught it while it was in stock was happy my build would look clean with it
What did he say
He just wanted to matter lmfao This was his hill and he died on it
Man imagine if he just reached out to GN privately and asked what they're on about before going ape shit online If I'm representing a company I'm keeping my mouth shut till I know the facts for sure and have talked to both sides
just read JonnyGURU's comments and I see nothing wrong with them Sometimes manufactures try and BS some of the technical stuff but Jonny was correctly telling Steve he was wrong Not normally a big deal but when Steve makes a video about it and it's viewed by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts and tech people I can see how on Jonny's side how this is really frustrating Did he have to use profanity no but this isn't some racist tirade or Jonny completely going off on Steve but rather for better or worse just pointing out how dumb of a statement Steve was making
Techno Jesus can't be wrong
I had a feeling it was Jon but was really hoping it wasn't Based on the comments here it looks like it is jonnyguru That'
Context What exactly was said
I feel like Steve at Gamers Nexus needs to teach a Master Class in Tech Drama it's seriously becoming his brand He does good tech engineering work but the drama is starting to lead
Out of loop anyone can enlighten me
Who can possibly think that fucking around with guys like GN or LTT is a good idea They are literally promoting your shit what are you doing
I think Gamers Nexus should sue the tits of that corsair cash cow legal disclosure I am not a lawyer but I play one on reddit
As soon as I saw the quote from a Corsair employee I knew it was Johnny guru Last year I was researching power supplies and thought I'd see what he had to say on the Tom's forums and LTT psu tier list threads He'
T 't a big deal
What was said
what exactly happened kinda out of the loop
I dont think there was need to apologise just should be shrugged it off like buddys that like to give some banter and met up with gamer nexus have a few drinks and end of
Not heard anything of this anywhere
the misinformation and user confusion comes from leakers and youtuber themselves and you representative not nvidia nvidia clearly stated on website video social media it's safe to use your current psu and won't eat up to 600w by gpu itself the 600w is overclocking power limit with all cables connected and it has two smart sensing GN proofed it
He s not the Messiah he s a very naughty boy
Ooooooh nerd dramaaaaa
This seems like the right way to apologize I m okay with it
Nerds mad
You don't fuck with tech Jesus
This whole thread is so full of misinformative comments it's unbelievable
Dude come on the first thing on Corsair's relations department's list should be Don't mess with Gamers Nexus
They do represent Corsair A Corsair employee said it publicly Corsair is a trash white box company always has been
Are we super sure he's wrong
Mistakes were made GN accepted the apology let's move on
Gamers Nexus is literally the most fragile people Anything but positivity and he is going to freak the fuck out
that guy is gone forsure
Never buying Corsair again Thanks JonnyLoser
I don t get why they had to post a we re sorry
I really wish all companies would address minor mistakes the same way Nice one Corsair
Can we please stop blaming jonnyguru and just appreciate that two big entities in the pc industry just came to an agreement right after a conflict That's something less and less are able to do and I feel we should see the good thing about someone still being able to do so
Gamers are a toxic fucking crowd Dear god what a bunch of whiners acting just how you'd expect unactualized people in their parents basement to act
To be honest gamers nexus tends to blow up little things seems like a minor miscommunication Adding a wire does not affect wattage from P IV viewpoint using the sense pins to allow more overclocking in software is probably something Johnny Guru was unaware of not a huge deal
I've only bought a few corsair products One was an SSD that broke quickly The RMA process took months I worked at a company that also made SSDs I know we do cross shipping and if I had bought it from my employer I would've had a replacement in days Corsair is a small company and yeah That comes with some cons
Good guy Corsair
No worries Just walk that one dude the front door
Meanwhile Corsair psu's blow up daily
Yeah blame it on one employee instead of taking responsibility as a company
Jayz new video with corsairs cables is up and he tried to boot with one sense wire in connector on gpu side the FE didnt activate turn on but the computer went into windows the FE had no fan spin up or leds at all Either JG is wrong also about just 1 pin or Jay needs to test the other pin only being hooked up
Only the best companies own up facts
It's 2022 and we still have tell people not be wrong AND loud And then JohnnyGuru hit the loud AND tried to get receipts to go falsely snitch on big players in the game I just want to meet him and say Hi Mr Guru
code for we fired their stupid ass
Good on corsair The drama queens over at Gamers Nexus really milk this one for all it was worth though
2x8pin to 12pin might be for single rail PSU no power limit for each 8 pin 4x8pin to 12pin might be for multi rail PSU 150w limit for each 8 pin
Fired
Looks like everyone is really fooled Let s get all the facts straight here once and for all For such a simple and clear thing it is so disappointed to see everyone is misled by all those big YouTubers For all the tech Youtubers either you have completed no idea what you are talking about or you are simply misleading everyone by intent In short instead of saying connecting 4x8pin will give you 33 extra power you should actually say by using Nvidia adapter connecting 3x8pin will REDUCE 33 of the power to 450w mode from the normal 600w mode by the IC of the Nvidia adapter This is simply switching reducing from 600w mode to 450w mode NOT getting 33 extra power on top of 600w There is no such thing As simple as this Q1 Do you actually need 4x8pin to use 600w mode NO not at all Actually you can use full 600w with only 2x8pin just like those cables offered by Corsair Lian Li Seasonic etc Q2 How many 8pin is needed to support 600w 2x8pin only Q3 By connecting 3x8pin via the Nvidia adapter what power setting is used 450W it is switched downgraded to 450W by the IC only Q4 By connecting 4x8pin via the Nvidia adapter what power setting is used 600W Q5 By connecting 2x8pin via PSU direct cables what power setting is used 600W the same 600W Q6 What it is the same 600W power setting when using 2x8pin direct PSU cables Yes exactly the same 600W power mode Q7 So what 133 is about In short 4090 is a 450W card So if you are using 450W power setting it is 100 When you use 600W power setting mode there is an extra 150W on top of 450W and this is 33 Q8 So there is no such thing as 33 extra on top of 600W NO there is simply no such thing as 33 extra on top of 600W Q9 How about I connect a 2x8pin direct cable will I still see 133 in EVGA Precision YES 133 simply means 600W power mode for the 4090 which is a 450W card As long as the Sense0 Sense1 wires are connected to GND it is 600W power code Q10 If I connect 4x8pin via the Nvidia adapter am I getting a 800W mode 133 of 600W NO there is no such thing It is simply the same 600W mode In reversed if you only connect 3x8pin via the Nvidia adapter it is REDUCED to 450W Q11 So what is the benefit to use Nvidia adapter if I already have a direct 2x8pin to 12vhpwr cable from the PSU vendor NO benefit 600W is always the max setting you can set used for 12vhpwr An extra connection via an adapter is just an extra point of failure Direct GPU PSU cable is always the better than an adapter Q12 So why PSU vendors can make a 2x8pin cable in 600W mode Because they are the one making the PSUs and they know each 8pin port of their PSU can handle 300W Only 2x8pin already means 600W which is already 33 more on top of the 450W 4090 card Q13 So why Nvidia is making 4x8pin adapter with an IC to reduce the power mode Because GPU does not know anything about your cables and PSU You may be using some really crappy substandard cables and PSU or you are daisy chaining your cables improperly So to avoid any liability Nvidia just reduces the power setting to 450W when only 3x8pin is connected just to play safe Let me repeat again it is NOT giving you 33 extra on top of 600W It is reducing 33 from 600W to become 450W Q14 So if I m using a modern PSU from reputable brands Corsair Seasonic EVGA Lian Li is there a reason to use the Nvidia adapter NO simply no Q15 Why all 4 senses wires are connected in the Nvidia adapter but other 12vhpwr cables with 2 sense wires only NO the fact is only 2 sense wires are actually connected in the Nvidia adapter cable Just exactly the same as all the other 12vhpwr cables you see The other 2 wires are dummy wires not connected for appearance only without any purpose When you remove the sleeving you will see 2 sense wires are hanging there in the middle without connecting to anything Q16 To conclude connecting 4x8pin via the Nvidia adapter is the same as connecting 2x8pin via a direct cable It will use the exact same 600W power setting mode with the same 133 overhead showing in software YES exactly By now you should understand the facts now Can you tell again who is telling the truth and who is telling misleading information Just ask your favorite YouTubers these simple questions to confirm 33 extra means 33 on top of the normal 600W power mode Or it simply means the same 600W as if using a direct 2x8pin cable Nvidia adapter is offering extra power on top of 600W over other cables Or in reverse it is reduced to 450W mode when not connecting 4x8pin even each of your 8pin can handle 300W Everyone knows and can understand the PCIE 5 0 standard with 150W 300W 450W 600W modes If you really want the public to understand just say in this condition it is 450W mode in that condition it is 600W mode if you are using this cable it is 600W mode etc There won t be any confusion and misunderstanding at all But now as you can see in this thread almost everyone misunderstood what is really happening It is pathetic
That is why you fail attacking GN A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense never for attack bad JG A Jedi's strength flows from the Force GN subscribers You must unlearn what you have learned especially from the Internet Wars not make one great Corsair has apologized sniffle sniffle GN was right
Why do i get this VERGE feeling Except this is worse because we are talking about PSU power here One wrong
Til on Reddit you can get into a pissing match over the specs of a cable oh what a fun time to live
Heard many things about GamersNexus being on marketing payrolls
That Corsair staff made me so angry I know Guru3D Hilbert since 2006 i trust him fully Same for GN Steve and also Nvidia ManuelG
Well said
can't Perhaps it needs adapters to connect to psu
what a come down
Yeah it was very rude of how that Corsair employee responded to GamersNexus It was totally unwarranted and uncalled for
Good for them they didn't make excuses
Just once I wish a company would say something like yeah you heard him and
I've never used their products They can royally Piss off
day by day pc enthusiast space looks like kardashians show people are more interested in drama
Somebody got shit canned
A M se once bit my
Good apology
Nothing more than a troll managing their social media accounts
People have a bad day understandable when it comes to the shitty practices they're forced under over time Big fucking deal for popping off for a bit Rather that than the perceived BS that everyones' closets are skelly free
lol
Corsair has been a garbage tier company ever since they switched from making good products to making gamer gear and spending more on marketing than R D I'm sure the pivot made them more money from the crowd of folks who don't read reviews and just buy what marketers tell them to but they lost any respect from folks who care about performance over looks It's a bummer I remember when Corsair EKWB Thermaltake made good products instead of gamer products
Way to go corsair I own a lot of their pc products especially cases and psu Glad they quickly apologized
JayTwoCent is running into the same issue with the OC headroom on Corsair's cable v dbT84gxKnMA
At least their legal department knows what to say but it s not like it was some random nobody making the comments about Steve
About time
That's their legal department speaking
His department for one there is no single dude who speaks for the whole company apart from maybe the CEO and two they need to do some damage control
That he's the pinnacle of his department doesnt change the fact that this was his opinion and not representative of anyone else at Corsair or Corsair itself
Ah yes corporate speak for Individuals who represent our company do not represent our company when we don't want them to Deal with it
The fact it was JonnyGuru him fucking self
Unfortunately that one person is allegedly context 1 JonnyGuru the PSU Head of Research Development grimacing face edit typo
Wait the 12pin cable from Corsair doesn't support 600w
Companies always resort to the comments and views do not represent XXXXXX as a company when faced with backlash
Fired For being wrong about something For using the word bullshit Get real It was a mistake Worst case they'll ask him not to participate in public forums but probably even that won't happen This is a minor thing being blown way out of proportion Those guys need to sit down share a beer trade apology accept apology and go back to doing great things Nobody needs to be fired
This is standard fortune 500 't make any statement without clearance
Jayztwocents just did a video yesterday using this cable and it was detecting
Their special replacement cable does not limit the GPU to 450w The NVIDIA adapter limited to certain amount of connections does The Corsair cable will support 600w
I don't know if the 450W limit is a bad thing although it's nice to have the option to go higher I plan to have one undervolted down to 300W Are people really wanting to push 600W
Seriously if your life is as uninteresting as to want blood for someone's stupid snarky comments then you should really reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly consider making something of yourself because you'll end up in a bad spot otherwise
Now way they actually limit the 4090 to 450w Even that 2 8 pin to 16 pin new cable
I'm wondering if the new cable for the newer asus psu has the same limit now they claim 600w but it connects with only 2 slots on the psu side
Oh really So their 1 to 2 cable can only go up to 450w instead of 600w they claimed
What s inflammatory about the messages Just seems like he s sharing facts based on the capabilities of the technology based on the imgur link that other person sent Am I missing something
He has s 20 t CyRw96XMWuoOHj3w3dJp5w Blessed be his name raising hands
Heeemmm I m gonna you to go ahead and come in and work this Saturday Oh and Sunday too
I have people skills I am good with dealing with people Can't you understand that What the hell is wrong with you people
You're jumping to conclusions
Finally someone that understands there is much missinformantion and drama in this thread
so no pitchfork all is good
Holy shit dude This needs to be pinned I m kind of a moron but you absolutely cleared this up for me
not do something stupid like plug the 600W GPU into a 850W PSU Stupid person here could you please explain this bit I have already used a PSU rated higher than my GPU requires
Except that Corsair's cables are only 600w on a 1200w PSU They're 450w on a 1000w PSU and 300w on a 850w or 750w PSU From their own support page 600W load requires a 1200W rated CORSAIR PSU or higher 450W load requires 1000W or higher 300W load requires 750W or higher If they have no way of limiting the power draw except to warn people this is gonna end up a shit show
I wouldn t call the 150W artificial It s the spec even if most all high end 1000W power supplies can exceed it I have a hunch that a trip to Ali express will find us some power supplies that won t handle 300W on an 8 pin
Not correct on seasonics front I have their brand new tx1600 stated as a ATX 3 0 1000 watt their cable is rated for 600 watts but only two sense pins meaning this will in actuality will only output 450 watts from the PSU end as the card will read that as the limit This has been stated by seasonic themselves and reported by Igor s labs
Thanks
It is up to you as a user to not do something stupid like plug the 600W GPU into a 850W PSU can you elaborate
What the fuck You can't do that How would I spend my entire weekend not getting mad at something relatively trivial What should I do with these popcorn orders Gonna watch extreme overclocking version of the graphics card if it exists Well the AIO water cooled cards are there
the short of it is that each 8 pin connector is electrically rated to supply up to around 300W give or take and the 150W limit is entirely artificial This isn't true though There's absolutely no guarantee that an arbitrary 8 pin PCIe power cable can take more than 150W because that's the spec many older cables may only be rated for the spec and no more A compliant load also can't even draw more than 150W per 8 pin plug because that's the spec Many PCIe 8 pin cables can probably deliver 300W but it's not actually guaranteed at all It's just true for cables built by Corsair and probably other high quality PSU manufacturers Corsair's 8 pin connectors on their PSU side are Type 4 and rated for 300W They're physically the same as PCIe 8 pins but they're a different specification The rest of the cable just happens to be rated for 300W as well and terminated on the PCIe 8 pin side to the same standards which is why their PCIe 8 pin cables can take 300W
hose cables are set to 600W permanently which potentially presents a problem as the 4090 will read I have 600W available even if you've plugged your cable into a 550W PSU Uh potentially Hundreds maybe a few thousand people will do exactly this 3rd party adaptors shorting pins to fake out the GPU to think it's plugged in to something 600W capable is completely unacceptable
What is different about seasonic's cable
From what I ve seen the Corsair custom cable is solid core and not stranded like traditional psu cables That would be able to handle a higher current capacity than the traditional stranded cables Even JayZtwocents showed how the Corsair cable holds its bend s extremely strong like solid core copper wires do
1 Are there even any 550w modular power supplies with a compatable HPWR cable AND sufficient ports to plug in in to 2 The 150W power limit per 8 pin PCIe connector nothing to do with cables being rated to 150W or 300W It's only a passive agreement that if all 8 pins are connected in the connector the the device GPU can freely assume 150W are available over that connector Even if 300W were possible and they normally are the device can't know that as the standard only mandates that 150W be guaranteed So for a 300W cable to be fully utilised by a device GPU that can only be accomplished if the cable has two 8 pin PCIe connectors 3 Some such modular cables have 8 pins at the PSU end some have 12 pins Neither are PCIe connectors They're connectors bespoke to the PSU manufacturer Conflating the 8 pin PCIe connector with the PSU connector is wrong they don't even have the same keying and often don't have the same pinout They simply sometimes just so happen to have the same number of pins coincidentally 4 Corsair's HPWR cable isn't fixed at 600W Each sense pin is grounded to a different socket at the PSU end If you fail to connect both PSU connectors one ome sense pin is grounded
No limit problem that adapter has two sense pins so it will operate up to 600W Jayztwocents confirmed this
I clicked on this thread looking for context and this top comment doesn't even look like English to The question can you explain like I am a moron what you're talking about
Yes because it only has one sense pin It will limit all 4090's to 450w instead of the 600w cap Some can even hit 666w
Nobody fucks with the Tech Jesus
If you re about to spout off saying Steve is wrong about something it d be a good idea to stop and double check your assumptions
It's literally suicide by getting steamrolled He will demolish anyone
Thanks Steve
Yeah I find GN are the best for detailed hardware coverage and Digital Foundry rule the roost for software coverage
Blasphemy shall not be tolerated
IS that the GN guy
My baptism was following his reviews for my own build
Steve makes mistakes too
Ah another Steve that needs to be more recognized
JonnyGuru was allegedly fed misinformation irony by Nvidia Regardless it seems GN's EVGA Left At The Right T v CmUb9sDS9zw video headline rings truer with each passing
I sort of agree i dont really get what the argument is about Why would anyone overclock a brand new GPU that is already overkill Who gives a shit about making it draw more power Corsair made the cable to work with their PSU so I wouldnt be surprised if this is going to end up with GN plugging other PSUs maybe EVGA For everyone caught in the middle of this horse manure then the PSU is one of the most important decisions u make in ur build and if it smells like bullshit why so it is
Let's not go too far here he was wrong and doubled down initially which is bad but that doesn't make him a diva or mean he suddenly is a liability for C 's it he has an ego and should be let go Do you hold yourself to such standards
Let's be honest most people here have heard of jonnyGuru not because of his work but for the work of OklaWolf Taz on the eponymous site
armchair reddit psychologist moment
I hear there's an opening at NewEgg HQ
The guy in question Johnnyguru was the de facto 1 trusted PSU reviewer years before he even worked for Corsair He's been in GN's videos before and it was assumed they had a pretty decent relationship until this point Supposedly Johnny was fed misinformation straight from Nvidia which is why he was so quick to erroneously call BS on GN Johnny could should have fact checked or at the minimum kept it more professional
That's not what I was expecting when you said original tweet
The 600w cable is fine this drama is all specific to Nvidia s adapter that comes with the 4090 and how it works
He was incorrect about something due to Nvidia misinforming him about the products schematics He called the GN and Guru3d findings bullshit When he realized he was wrong and they were right he called Nvidia or maybe just declared to the universe ass clown moose fuckers and apologized This is the official apology from Corsair It's all very silly and mostly harmless but the gamers gotta rise up firetrident emblem
Everyone makes
He said wiping your ass while standing is superior to doing it while sitting Total chaos for the last six hours
To be fair Steve wasn't even looking for it this time He just posted his findings about a product The dude's overreaction was organic
From what I've read so far sounds like Corsair thought GN was wrong on gpu power info but turns out Nvidia gave wrong info to Corsair
it's not about them promoting that's why a lot of the changes from PSU's and PC case manufacturing came from their complaints over the
Seriously I take a lot of advice from those two neither has steered me wrong why would you bite the hand that feeds you It s just dumb
My the OP intent was to follow up on a previous and topical post involving all parties involved I'd challenge your assertion that my post is a reach as the PSU adapter has been a topic of much debate rightfully so and is telling of a much bigger issue sign of Nvidia steadily pushing AIBs aside in favor of exclusivity of information product specs and in house innovations such as the adapters ICs implementation seemingly w o Corsair's knowledge
He is wrong about the adapter the adapter includes an extra bit of circuitry that checks how many cables are connected and adjusts power limit per the ATX 3 0 PCIe 5 0 spec Jonnyguru assumed that the adapter was the same as the one he was working on which just uses the two sense pins but the extra circuit is necessary because depending on how an end user hooks up the cables you could do it wrong if you didn t have the circuit to check Think about it if you have 4 connectors and a user could disconnect one but still run the GPU but they could disconnect any one of them then relying on just the grounded connections to check for how many connectors are there wouldn t work You only have two sense pins per the spec Daisy chaining the sense pins wouldn t work so you need an extra little circuit to tally how many grounded circuits there are and then you can send the ground signal on the sense pins that corresponds to the power spec What Jonnyguru at Corsair made is a dumb connector with no circuit to check Because they don t need one Theirs goes directly from the PSU to the GPU it s not an adapter And it uses two 8 pin PSU connections so they can simply put one sense pin going to each PSU connection and they meet ATX 3 0 PCIe 5 0 spec
That guy is the head of their power supply development I m sure they ll keep him just ask him to rant less
JonnyGuru just had an outburst here This employee's outburst doesn't affect the quality of their power supplies or anything Sure it might have affected Corsair's PR but I see no reason here to stop buying their products
I mean calling out misinformation that wasn't misinformation while distributing misinformation and doing it in a rude manner does in fact warrant an apology when they work with GN often
Cause they were wrong and were rude in spreading false information
In comes the South Park Were Sorry skit
ermm this is textbook how companies address mistakes might as well be a copy and paste job from the PR team
Try following the topic
Dude a major company called them literally bullshit that is no minor miscommunication
The freaking head of PSU R D accused them of bullshit misinformation without reaching out to them prior are you serious
Your comment is bullshit misinformation
What
Corsair small LuL
Eh Was it a company approved message
He did If it was on one side it maxed 450 If it was on the other no boot If it was both 600
Corsair is far from perfect so let's not go overboard This was just blatantly wrong even MSI would have owned this one
He's not just an influencer He's tech Jesus
I agree it's stupid drama but come
GN posted a video where nVidia said they put an IC in their 4x8 pin to 12 pin adapter It s not just a passive cable
The problem lies in the engineering side of it Have you ever tightened a chain too fast It might stretch this is the approach with the power connectors They need to be at least 60 more robust then their highest possible power limit to account for the possibility of a surge A surge can in a fraction of a second turn a wire from 35c to 500c which melt all metals including the PCB This and the fact that the power delivery is done in phases The more connections the more phases or array of phases the power delivery can supply Lastly and the most likely is just design differences Not every card is designed exactly alike some cards need another connection because its required for delivery in a certain portion of the card that needs isolation from the other deliveries This is most likely due to electronic noise which can hinder performance and OverClockability
Yeah right GN is just about the LAST tech Youtuber that would be on a marketing payroll lol It's not like they're LTT by any stretch and have a long history of calling out any and all shitty behavior by companies
Source I think what you're saying is bullshit tech Jesus clearly addresses that he is not taking the side of that video card manufacturer it was that Nvidia wasn't giving him any information He acknowledged it was a one sided story and was skeptical of them in several areas in the video
You ve heard many things huh Care to source that This sounds like utter bullshit
You come off as jonnyguru himself
No you haven't GN are right in any case Even one of the designers of the fucking card explained it JonnyGuru is wrong and badly wrong and they're selling a flawed product
Not all the voices you hear in your head are real
In a thread about misinformation why are you spreading more This is just more bullshit
he's literally right here what are you smoking
are you smoking corporate balls rn or something
Agreed a company wide jerk off session for the boys would really help to bring up morale
When you are part of a company or institution especially if you are a high rank employee and you talk to the press and media in any way interview Twitter post story etc you have to know that you're a representative of that company institution and anything you say whether is your opinion or not it's on behalf of the company institution you work for unless you make a clear disclaimer Discusing if Corsair took action because they don't think like that or because they just want to avoid the bad PR is a mystery that only the heads of Corsair know Either way good for corsair on taking fast action
There needs to be accountability at some point else any action a corporation takes is faultless
Link to messages
That s what was so crazy to me I was like of all fucking people JonnyGuru is out here saying this shit
That's a big OOF
THEEEE JONNYGURU jesus christ wtf happened there
Whoah I had a feeling it was him but dismissed it thinking he wouldn't do that since he's worked with GN before Dang
Making all the information about that connector even more confusing given he was lauded as an authority on the subject when discussing that ATX3 0 PCIe power connector in a recent video A lot of people were saying hey it's not just some guy it's JonnyGuru 's wrong about this but there is absolutely a LOT of misinformation about this connector out there
Why am I not surprised Just look at how toxic he is on LTT forum or techpowerup forum
I was about to say as long as they keep making great PSU s it doesn t bother me and then I read this comment lol
Maybe he needs to ditch the Guru for now
Ouch IF proven to be true dude just lost a shit ton of credibility Gonna need to change his name to JonnyDumbass after this blunder
Damn I literally bought my PSU based on his reviews recommendations
I haven't heard that and Steve knows JonnyGuru personally so I don't necessarily think that's the case We'll see
Omfg Jonny
Dayumn
I am shocked if it was Jonny I was going to say they should've talked to him before saying that
There's no way he'd do that wtf Man was the best power supply reviewer for so long and probably still is
lol looks like he's not guru at all
Welp time to strike off Corsair from List of reputable ATX 3 0 PSUs
Those responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked have been sacked
It does The cable included with the new GPUs need all four cables plugged in though
Accidentally deleted my original comment I have the 12 pin Corsair cable and 4090 Strix and it goes go past 450w Afterburner power slider goes to 20 Max I saw is 470w at 2950ish Mhz before it crashed
Their 12 pin cable only has one sense pin from what I understand which the GPU will then know and limit it to 450w
Kinda silly to assume it does Its like the one person in your family saying some off the cuff weird shit Do they represent your views EDIT Added a Y
's the logical position to take they're issuing an apology they know they're wrong if it is indeed an employee speaking out of turn and doesnt represent the company culture what are they supposed to say yes we absolutely feel the same way and agree with them but we're sorry you're mad
It's very funny considering that they hired that person to be their fucking representative That sort of FUCKING IMPLIES REPRESENTATION
You apologize you get shit on one and shit on for apologizing thing You double down you get shit on two things or even more Gigabyte and Newegg is probably too familiar with all that feeling of being shitted down again and again no one but someone that actually cares give a flying fuck about both of them in years to come You either gotta eat the horse shit or eat the moose shit Someone gotta deal with that shit either way any fucking time
Exactly lol Saying someone could get fired for something like this is so American
I really don't care either way honestly
What about calling Nvidia ass clown moose fuckers lol
minor thing he's the head of r d everyone knows he works at corsair what he said can reflect corsair as a company that's not professional statement at all
Exactly and it is a learning for him to double check his facts with Nvidia because he was very sure about something that had to come from Nvidia directly
Fired No Demoted Maybe He should have known about the behavior of the things he works with Making fun of Definitely If anything for saying stupid shit onlike WHILE in the wrong
Johnnyguru GN's team for PSU testing was guided by JG with some additional JG interviews for ez content And JG's tweet is now used for spicy filler content by GN I would not expect a GN JG PSU content part 2 anytime soon
I've yet to see this proven in power draw
Just so you know He is wrong He is all over this post spreading misinformation in a post about misinformation
I'd think the majority of people buying a 2000 enthusiast grade GPU would want to max it out as much as possible Most people don't even know what undervolting is lol They've also shown that limiting the power is the way to go with these cards Undervolting tanks performance and underclocks them Don't Undervolt the RTX 4090 v XrZNSTmOstI t 2s
No he is wrong He believes the cable only has 1 sense pin but it has both required pins
It depends on if they knew the spec properly Having only 2 connections isn't the issue it's having the IC's in the cable which tell the GPU how much wattage is available If the GPU doesn't get that information it defaults to 450w
Each PSU side connector can supply 300W Just like each pig tailed PCIe connector 8 pin PSU side to 2x 6 2 pin PCIe can also supply 300W
It can do 600w just fine The other person who replied to you is wrong
From what I've been seeing yes The Corsair cable seems to cap the power draw at around 100 whereas the included adapter will cap it at 133
I think it was less about the content and more about the way he said it
He's apparently also wrong if you read the other comments around here Wrong and accusatory is a bad combo
Apology accepted on our end as opposed to someone else's xD
If you look at the thread it's mainly one person spreading the misinformation The problem is the bunch of reactionary idiots who had the pitchforks out against corsair mass upvoting his posts
Using a PSU higher than your GPU requires isn't stupid at all and is common and often considered good practice However bear in mind in the context of this discussion a 600W GPU means a GPU that can draw 600W on its own You'll probably also be pairing it with a high end 200W CPU with a high end motherboard and maybe a few SSDs 850W isn't really enough headroom to safely run a GPU that draws 600W alone Really a 600W GPU should be recommending a 1000W PSU or even more The 4090 skirts around this by technically being a 450W GPU which is why they recommend an 850W power supply
If they have no way of limiting the power draw except to warn people this is gonna end up a shit show Correct they do not There is no way their cable can detect what power supply it's being used with even if it did have some sort of IC because the old PCIe 8 pin cable has no communication pins except for a single very basic very limited functionality sense pin Their limit is the warning I agree that it's not a good solution and I would much rather have some sort of physical limitation or even some explicit stated limitation where they sell two or three different wattages of cables each one marked for compatibility with a different set of power supplies Not this we have a single cable but don't draw more than X watts on a Y watt PSU deal Especially not when the only places it can be found are a pretty buried support page and the press release That said however in the first place power draw limits were always a warning to begin with there's nothing stopping you from plugging a 3090Ti into a 500W PSU but it would still trip OCP
The spec is what I was calling artificial to begin with It was set pretty much arbitrarily with little to no regard to the actual electrical capabilities of the Molex Mini fit 8 pin connector It was simply Nvidia saying we've decided that any card we make with an 8 pin connector will be expected to draw 150W on that connector Yes the end result is that proper PCIe compliant power supplies should be able to supply 150W minimum on their 8 pin cables but even so that's just because they're adhering to an artificial spec defined by Nvidia and PCI SIG A trip to Aliexpress would certainly yield power supplies that can't supply 300W on an 8 pin but it would also yield power supplies that can't supply 150W on an 8 pin either
It's the difference between the 8 pin Type 4 connector which is proprietary to Corsair modular PSUs and the 8 pin PCIe connector which has 150W limit in the spec The Type 4 connector may be physically identical to many PCIe 8 pin connectors but the difference is that it's guaranteed by Corsair handle at least 300W maybe more not sure what their actual internal specs are for it This is why Corsair can provide a 1x Type 4 2x PCIe 8 pin splitter The PSU side Type 4 and cable itself is rated for 300W The 150W limit is just on the PCIe 8 pin plugs It's the same for the 2x Type 4 12VHPWR cable TL DR 8 pin Type 4 connector is not the same as the 8 pin PCIe connector they are different specs This confuses a shitload of people
Good info thanks Are you sure it has two sense pins then The 450W configuration would be Sense0 open Sense1 ground
Why aren't they grounding both sense pins
Are they going to change fix that
A 600 W card may potentially spike more than 800 1000 W tripping the protections In bad high wattage PSU this could ruin that ranked on DOTA or could take down your entire system with the excessive power draw It has only been released for a couple of days Give it some time before some wacky issues pop up
There's absolutely no guarantee that an arbitrary 8 pin PCIe power cable can take more than 150W because that's the spec many older cables may only be rated for the spec and no more I said connector not cable In practice all PCIe 8 pin power connectors are rated for 300W or more given that practically all of them are Molex Mini fit Jr or Mini fit HC and the electrical characteristics of those connectors are known to be able to carry 300W at 12v You're correct that some older cables can't deliver 300W because they were designed to the artificial 150W spec and as a result the company didn't bother to use more than 18AWG or even 20AWG wire to wire the cable If you tried you'd set them on fire Moreover some older power supplies might not even have rails powerful enough to output 300W over a single PCIe cable even if the cable could handle it But that's not what my discussion was about I was talking specifically about the new 12VHPWR retrofit cables that Corsair Be Quiet Seasonic and other PSU makers are now releasing and those cables are going to be wired with 16AWG and manufactured to a standard where a single 8 pin can deliver 300W Rail limitations aren't going to be a problem because they know exactly what power supplies they're designing these cables to be used with so they know the limits of their rails Plus most modern power supplies are single rail anyways Corsair's 8 pin connectors on their PSU side are Type 4 and rated for 300W The Type 4 doesn't have anything to do with the power rating it's just a classification that Corsair uses for their pinout so that people don't plug a different cable in where a GND pin is wired to a 12V pin on the PSU modular connector and set their computer on fire They're all Mini fit HC connectors electrically rated to the same 300W
I don't disagree with you but also keep in mind this is really no different from what the situation's been for the past two decades already GPUs never had any sort of sensing as to how much power is available to them and you were always free to plug a GPU into a power supply not powerful enough for it These are the first GPUs in the world that have some sort of power supply capability sensing and it's just taking the industry some time to catch up Until then the situation really isn't much different from how it's been for years already
As per Nakoron's comment utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 apparently Seasonic's cable only has the sense pins configured to 450W This is all secondhand info though
Are there even any 550w modular power supplies with a compatable HPWR cable AND sufficient ports to plug in in to Corsair has a 550W RMx unit that is compatible with their own 12VHPWR cable and has enough ports to plug both in The 150W power limit per 8 pin PCIe connector nothing to do with cables being rated to 150W or 300W It's only a passive agreement that if all 8 pins are connected in the connector the the device GPU can freely assume 150W are available over that connector I didn't say anything to the contrary I just said the 150W spec is artificial Some such modular cables have 8 pins at the PSU end some have 12 pins Neither are PCIe connectors They're connectors bespoke to the PSU manufacturer Conflating the 8 pin PCIe connector with the PSU connector is wrong they don't even have the same keying and often don't have the same pinout They simply sometimes just so happen to have the same number of pins coincidentally I know this notice I never said PCIe connector just 8 pin connector That was very much intentional But even so the point here is that the connectors are similar enough that plenty of laypeople will see the PCIe 8 pin connector and the associated 150W spec then extend that to apply to 8 pin connectors in general especially when the actual physical PSU connector looks identical with a different keying What I'm trying to clarify here is simply that an 8 pin connector patterned after Molex Mini fits as PCIe power connectors as well as many PSU end modular cable connectors are are in no way actually limited to 150W from an electrical standpoint Instead if they happen to use the same number of power and ground wires as the original PCIe spec the limit for any 8 pin connector in that pattern is closer to 300W with some variance depending on the exact connector type used And on that note the PSU connectors aren't bespoke they're just implemented with a custom pinout Corsair has explicitly stated they use Molex Mini fit HC and the keying matches standard part numbers on Molex's site The PCIe 8 pin connector isn't specifically detailed as a Molex Mini fit in the official PCIe spec document probably for the sake of brand neutrality but if you read the PCIe electromechanical specs and compare with Molex's own spec sheet for the Mini fit Jr I think it's pretty clear that the PCIe connector is essentially a re keyed Mini fit And that's even aside from the fact that Molex personnel are credited 9 times in the acknowledgments section of the PCIe 5 0 electromechanical specs Amphenol who as far as I can tell is the primary supplier of the 12VHPWR connector is credited twice Corsair's HPWR cable isn't fixed at 600W Each sense pin is grounded to a different socket at the PSU end If you fail to connect both PSU connectors one ome sense pin is grounded I'll also bet that the cable ships with a ton of warnings telling you to plug in both The ATX 3 0 design guide states 12VHPWR connector cable harnesses that are hard wired to the power supply shall be labeled indicating the maximum power supported according to the Sense0 1 encoding implemented for each connector The Corsair cable is labeled with 600W meaning they intend for you to treat it as a cable with both of the sense pins hardwired to the power supply I don't think there's any point in treating it as anything other than a 600W cable
Thanks
In English that sentence would be The question is do the expensive Corsair PSU adapters have the 450w limit problem The stock nVidia PSU adapter cable has separate wires leading to an IC in it that allow the card to know how many PCIE power cables are plugged in since it has four female to one male connection in order to tell the card how much power it is allowed to draw and some aftermarket adapters haven't replicated that functionality properly
Corsair have launched a new adapter 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 600W PCIe 5 0 12VHPWR Type 4 PSU Power Cable p CP 8920284 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 600W PCIe 5 0 12VHPWR Type 4 PSU Power Cable p CP 8920284 to the new GPU's instead of launch new PSU's models It looks that some adapters from other brands have a 450W 't know from where comes the initial problem and the corsair comments about GN video
The number of the beast Steve has warned us
This is incorrect the Corsair 2x 8 pin to 12 pin adapter has both sense wires and will do 600W Jayztwocents confirmed this
7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 600W PCIe 5 0 12VHPWR Type 4 PSU Power Cable p CP 8920284 The cable is literally marked 600W and is stated in the description to support up to 600W power draw If I didn't misinterpret their info both sense pins are hardwired to ground and they're relying on the user to not do anything stupid like plug a 600W GPU into an 850W PSU Which isn't the best approach in and of itself but it's arguably better than limiting 4090s to 450W EDIT If you need further evidence look closely at their own product picture S3 and S4 are filled in with terminals S1 and S2 aren't I can't think of a reason they'd fill only the two sense terminals if they only intended to ground one of them
Source that it only has one pin
Aren't some limited to 450w by BIOS anyway Or can all do 600 My MSI Gaming Trio 4090 came with an Nvidia 3 to 1 adapter not 4 and has a max power of 106 in Afterburner If I plug in a 4 to 1 adapter will it go to 133
Do you know if the new corsair cable works on the SF750 platinum They got a chart on their website but I just don t get it If it really limits the card to 450w I can replace the 3 cable adapter thing with it
i google tech jesus to find the youtube channel and he comes up rightfully
He s not wrong he s just an asshole But not really Steve is the tits Edit this is a line from The Big Lebowski as is the earlier poster s
Steve and the Team While Steve is the face of the OP they are a team of seasoned pros who know their stuff
Except that time where he went against Linus about some stupid shit about selling shirts with a controversial theme Accordingly to Linus the shirt sold out mind you
Back to you Steve
The heretic must be dealt with brothers
Unplug his 12V
It's not so much that people don't make mistakes It's that the Corsair guy went directly after GN Guru3d to call them out To try to make them seem stupid It wouldn't be that big of a deal if it just any Corsair employee But it apprently was the head R D guy for power supplies for them Like if anyone should know how those pins work it's him And even if didnt know or understand the Corsair guy should have enough resources to reach out to someone who does Like is this the guy who is in charge of that new adapter for the 4090s and he doesn't understand how it works
Yes yes I would want to overclock it smiling face
You need a 1200 watt psu to be safe anyways few people have that already With all the transient spike problems of the 30xx series it doesn't make sense to reuse older PSUs If you want a graphics card that costs 2 grand and uses more power than any gpu in the past I think it's ok to recommend you buy a brand new PSU with the latest ATX spec I had a 3080 die within 30 days that was returned and a 3080ti that made it 5 months before dying I had to buy a 3060 just to have something This was with a Seasonic PRIME 750 watt Titanium psu and the recommended psu for the car was 750 watt and it still works I bought a new 1000 watt psu because gpus dying kills your whole pc I hope the replacement lasts
Reminds me of the Will Smith slap lol but yea this isn t near that level Guy made an honest mistake
nearly no one who takes this position does
cancel culture in action
Are you referring to the actual inflammatory and incorrect message s Here's a screenshot
Thanks for the clarification shits so confusing lmao
Oh Of course Huge props to the guy I had the feeling it was him because it sounded like something he would say I'm familiar with how he posts stuff because he's the first thing I Google whenever I have a PSU related query Heck that last thing I read from him about seasonic Psu's and issues with the 12v sense pin with the fix he recommended literally saved me from a needless PSU replacement It's just unfortunate And I can imagine Steve and Co at GN were equally crushed Jon Gerow is a veritable hero in the PSU space
im stupid so is their connector nerfed can it do 600watt
Let's not downplay Jonny's position in the company and overall decades' long reputation At the Director level he should he does understand how his words carry weight for himself and the billion dollar conglomerate he represents and overseas R D Corsair seems to by beginning their apology with inflammatory and incorrect
The messenger is their Director of PSU Research D
The key here is the misinformation which they make people think confuse you can only use 600w with 4x8pin is simply not true And using 4x8pin will give you an extra 33 power is also clearly not true The fact is that when using the Nvidia adapter with 3x8pin it is reduced 33 from 600w mode to 450w mode Assuming you are using a modern PSU which 3x8pin it can already handle 900w in 600w 12vhpwr power mode with a 450w GPU I believe you can also agree with these facts
Industry sources Like it or not
But no one here is selling a flawed product Seems you have fallen to the miss info just as feared by da Guru
RTX J
Sounds like a slave mindset Whatever I do after my working hours is my business That mindset that your employer can control you outside of work needs to go as long as you not breaking any laws
This guy Legals
And that isn't even all of them he kept going for a bit even after Steve tried to step in and discuss the issue with him
Those messages really don't look bad at all though
Link to messages 's it This much drama over this nothingburger of a comment
Seems he s always up his arse more convo i found
A mistake This is a nothing burger with a side of bullshit and ass clown moose fuckers
Making all the information about that connector even more confusing given he was lauded as an authority on the subject when discussing that ATX3 0 PCIe power connector in a recent video Well in the end regarding the connector itself I think we still can consider him an authority He's been dealing with these exact types of connectors for decades Even if the new one is a bit smaller it's likely that he still understands them better than nearly anyone except the people who designed the connector in the first place especially more than Jay who seems to be the person he was responding to This fuckup seemed to happen because he wasn't made aware that the Nvidia adapter had an IC in it that could sense and then selectively ground the sideband pins He thought it was just a passive adapter cable like he's probably used to It doesn't have much to do with the connector
But why is there misinformation about the connector as the specification has been released in February You would think that Corsair has access to that if I can find it with google search
Thing is he might have been unaware the the Nvidia adapter is active and how it works A passive adapter could never work the same way the Nvidia one does With a passive adapter you would either have to wire the sense pin to be always shorted No matter how many 8 pins are connected Or connect it to grounds in one specific connector A grounded pin is a grounded pin But the Nvidia adapter is active So it can ground the sense pin for 600w only when all 4 are connected since there's a IC in there that can detect each specific connector
I think he was going off the fact that there was no IC in the cable So the gpu couldn't sense that there were 3 or 4 connectors I guess nvidia isn't sharing good info with their 'partners'
But still calling total bullshit is a very bold comment to make about something they actually proved on video
Nvidia did something special and he didn't know about it I honestly don't think it's a big deal Although I think it was a blunder from him to not check such a basic thing before saying it like that
Even if he makes one mistake he's still probably forgotten more than you know Hardly deserving of a dumbass title from some rando
How do you know it was Jonny
C 't really a lack of knowledge sort of thing JonnyGuru has been the PSU guy pretty much for as long as enthusiast PSUs have been a thing He's been the most trustworthy source for PSU testing and reviews for as long as I can remember and I started building PCs over 20 years ago It sounds like Nvidia legitimately did fuck him over His error wasn't a lack of knowledge his error was not verifying what Nvidia told him and then doubling down on what Nvidia told him without making sure it was 't change his expertise it just makes him an asshole who made a mistake After reading all this I wouldn't hire the dude to run my company's Twitter feed but it doesn't change the level of trust in what he'd have to say about PSU's
Everyone knows that on the internet if you're wrong once you're forever wrong and your rights are automatically invalidated It's written on Reddit apparently Can't find em though
making a misinformed statement about brand new technology and it's adoptions doesn't magically invalidate his decades of experience within the space your psu is likely completely fine
He just didn't know that Nvidia implemented a feature into their cable It's not like that makes him not know anything about PSUs
It's literally in that screenshot lol Dude messed up
Click on the link in the comment you re replying to and it will take you to a comment in the original post showing a picture of him making the comment
I would just like to point out that no media outlet has gone more in depth in power supply reviews than jonnyguru
Yes he was absolutely wrong Not only did GN have proof of what they said they had footage of one of the engineers of the 4090 saying exactly what they said This is the case of the Corsair rep talking before they had first hand knowledge and also just not responding the right way If you as the well respected Corsair rep suspect GN is mistaken why not just talk to them Why call them trash in some Reddit thread
GN literally had an engineer from NVIDIA explain this and I wouldn t call Gamer Nexus folks noobs They have a few people who seem to know pretty well what they re doing JG was simply wrong That s what it is
Steve literally had an Nvidia engineer in house explain it to him and give him the same information about the power plugs he was relaying to the audience Think I'm gonna trust that over someone from Corsair
Human beings be human man shrugging This is a lesson he's surely never to forget and hopefully learn from
I ve been reading that 3 cables plus pcie slot get you to like 525 So if you want full use of that strix you should be using all four cables Otherwise transient spikes might not get the power they need and down lock the card for spurts
The difference is with the Corsair cable it has the sense pins configured for 600W and needs both cables connected to the PSU for the sense pins to even ground appropriately So the GPU will see 600W available just as if you used the Nvidia not sure if partner adapters are also active like Nvidia's adapter and connected 4 cables to it The Nvidia adapter however since it can be used with various configurations has an active IC small PLA or or even just some 74LS logic gates that uses a basic logic table to determine what a given output should be based on the inputs that checks each of the 4 cable inputs and if it sees 3 it sets the sense pins to the 450W setting by leaving sense0 open and sense1 grounded If it detects 4 it sets it to the 600W setting by grounding both sense0 and sense1 This is how the card is able to know whether 3 or 4 are connected just from the adapter alone and why the Corsair cable doesn't need to know
The 600w corsair cable has the 2 required sense pins to enable full 600w delivery It does this via 2x 300w 8 pin connectors found on corsair psus instead of using 4x 150w 8 pin connectors The original kerfuffle was over the nvidia supplied cable and what happens if only 3 of the 4 8 pin cables are attached
So this one 7C Parts PC Components Power Supplies 600W PCIe 5 0 12VHPWR Type 4 PSU Power Cable p CP 8920284
oh my god I just ordered it thinking since it plugs directly into the PSU it would guarantee 600W
At least in the picture there's definitely 2 pins in the connector My guess is that they are just hardwired to ground which if true would allow 600w
Not true The Corsair cable has Sense0 and Sense1 same as the NVIDIA adapter cable It will support up to 600w
If the employee who said those things isn t let go then congratulations that is now what the company represents
At will work states usually goes both ways You can leave quit work anytime for any reason without repercussions Just as the business can fire anyone anytime for any reason but usually there's a process to be followed to avoid lawsuits
American cancel culture is cancer
I'm glad Nobody should This story is just click driving outrage juice
What about it
Uh perhaps u r replying to the wrong comment Coz I'm confused
I'm surprised GN called out JG publicly Surely this could have been resolved privately JG admits he was wrong too It's bizarre considering how closely they've worked together before as you mentioned
You don't need to see it in power draw the fact that we know both S3 S4 are grounded means we know the cable is communicating to the GPU that 600W is available and that will unlock the 133 power slider on the FE cards Yes for all we know the Corsair cable could catch on fire as soon as you load it to 451W which it won't because Corsair knows what they're doing But that's not what you've been saying all this time in this thread You've been saying the sense pins on the Corsair cable are wired to hard lock the GPU down to 450W and that's wrong
I was holding off until BeQuiet got their cable out but now I want to play
Honestly the majority probably leave it at stock and just play Fornite or League
The IC isn't necessary it's only there in the Nvidia adapter because they want to be able to detect how many cables you have plugged into the adapter If you want the full 600W the simplest way is to simply hardwire S3 S4 to ground which is what Corsair and most third party cables do
He can t speak for whoever guru3d is that Corsair also blasted incorrectly
To be fair Jonny also lashed out to GN while not having all information himself
What if im pairing a 4090 with an i5 12400 and playing at 5k maxxed out though Wouldn't it be safe since the rest of the system probably wont draw more than 150w Or are you telling me its an issue regardless since the 600w draw doesnt include the 30 transient spikes
I m hung up on the word artificial Arbitrary maybe But it is what is defined in the spec That makes it real from the perspective that it is the minimum that anyone should design to That s why specs exist Interoperability
What s confusing is that there is a difference between the electrical and mechanical limits of something and the form design limits of something The adapter and connector have a use in context here The connector plastic housing has a spec It is not the relevant spec here The metal ends that physically make electrical contact have a spec They are not the relevant spec here The cable wire has a spec It is not the relevant spec here The only specs that are relevant are power supply specs which are claimed to subsequently adhere to the ATX spec version specified and subsequently the PCIeSIG spec for the connector use Anyone designing a product to use the ATX spec has to assume the minimum limits of the ATX spec Power supply makers can exceed those specs as much as they like and they do They can make whatever cables take advantage of their enhanced specs as well This is why the 2x8 Pin to 12 pin adapters exist and why nVidia or AIB s don t provide them nVidia is designing for the entire field of ATX supplies A power supply mfg only has to design to support their own hardware no one else s
I have a 850W PSU I probably should stay at 450W
The Type 4 doesn't have anything to do with the power rating it's just a classification that Corsair uses for their pinout so that people don't plug a different cable in where a GND pin is wired to a 12V pin on the PSU modular connector and set their computer on fire They're all Mini fit HC connectors electrically rated to the same 300W It has everything to do with the power rating It doesn't matter whether the model of 8 pin plug on the PCIe side is rated for 300W or whether the wire gauge is capable of it as well we all know that in practice modern PSUs supply cables that are rated well over the PCIe spec However per the PCIe spec you can never assume that and a GPU or load can never draw more than the rating This is why the 600W 12VHPWR adapters need 4 x 8 pin inputs There's no guarantee that any of the PCIe 8 pins can do more than 150W This is actually still very true of cables like Corsair's Type 4 2x 8 pin splitter cables The entire cable is only rated for 300W so each of those 8 pins on the end actually are only capable to 150W output The Type 4 connector is Corsair's spec It's their guarantee that any PSU and cable combination they manufacture with it is safe and for that they need to make it at least 300W on all their PSUs and cables to do the things they currently do with it The entire point is that it's outside the PCIe spec They can guarantee that it supports 300W because they use Mini fit HC's or whatever plug that can take it But that's not what my discussion was about I was talking specifically about the new 12VHPWR retrofit cables that Corsair Be Quiet Seasonic and other PSU makers are now releasing and those cables are going to be wired with 16AWG and manufactured to a standard where a single 8 pin can deliver 300W Rail limitations aren't going to be a problem because they know exactly what power supplies they're designing these cables to be used with so they know the limits of their rails Plus most modern power supplies are single rail anyways Yep I'm also talking about these cables The entire point is that the 8 pin plug on the PSU side is not a PCIe 8 pin power connector and is not bound by any assumption of a 150W only guarantee This is where lots of the confusion comes from People aren't understanding that an 8 pin plug on the GPU side is bound by a totally different spec to the 8 pin plug going into the modular power supply and don't understand why that cable is safe with only 2x 8 pin plugs whilst the 4x PCIe 8 pin 12VHPWR cable requires all 4x PCIe 8 pin inputs to be attached to reach 600W
As far as I'm aware no aftermarket adapters have replicated that functionality But as I've said in other comments in this thread the IC is an added extra and arguably unnecessary feature You don't need an IC in the cable to enable the full 600W operation You don't even need special circuitry in the power supply All you need is to hardwire the two sense pins in the sideband connector to ground Corsair's cable does this as do as far as I'm aware all third party adapters save for the ones that ship with AIB cards which are supplied by Nvidia Technically this violates PCIe spec as it means these adapters could force a power draw of more than 150W on a single 8 pin Practically it doesn't matter much If you have a quality power supply with enough wattage to run your GPU at whatever power level you intend to run it at then a 3x8 pin or even a 2x8 pin with the sideband connector set up right will work fine
Dude is off by 6 watts It adds up fast lol
Quickly now change into your alter ego No not Beve we need Tech Jesus dammit
Well that's unfortunate Steve on RTX 4090's OC power draw
Yes that's the one Allegedly it only uses one sense pin instead of the two that are in the included Nvidia spec adapter which lets the GPU know how much wattage to expect If it can't tell it just defaults to 450w Corsair basically said It's fine because it's only a 450w GPU That's what I've been reading anyhow
In Jay's video the card caps out at around 100 When using the included Nvidia adapter in his video Gamer's Nexus could put the card up to 133 power
I have the new Corsair cable and the 2 sense pins are connected to ground pin 5 on one cable and 8 on the other I've no 4090 to test it with though
Yes the dude is wrong spreading false information and for some reason getting upvoted Literally sue able by Corsair lmao
MSI Gaming Trio 4090 TPU VGA BIOS collection doesnt have that BIOS but based on other MSI 4090s there MSI has been pretty conservative and none of the MSI supriim cards can go very high with the power limit Only the Gigabyte ASUS and Founder's BIOSes at TPU have a 600W max power limit
Some might be sure The higher end AIB ones aren't but the basic cards might be I'm not sure with that specific card Try it out and see If it changes the power limit you'll know pretty quick
It will work if you have 2 x type 4 8 pin PCIe power connectors on your PSU which it looks like you have
because linus's fanbase is braindead children who love the dumb shit that he does linus is an idiot and was objectively wrong in that situation and even his own staff was all but openly saying cut it out we're in the wrong here
Attach the 2 of the connectors to his nipples and zap thee
I mean yeah fair enough But Steve also goes after people and calls them out as well Remember the LTT warranty thing And on the occasions where Steve has been proven wrong he doubles down and doesn't ever admit it All I'm saying is that Steve is no saint and has said done similar things as Johnny guru so we should stop glorifying this guy like he can do no wrong
Considering how long and hard Nvidia has fucked over their partners I m not surprised at his reaction and don t find it over the top Nvidia waits so long to give him this information without even supplying a test card so that he can verify the least he can do is assume the company making the fucking product is correct about it The actual over the top response is the ass clown moose fuckers regarding Nvidia after he learned they gave him wrong information which I think is again justified considering how fucked Nvidia is Basically Nvidia bit him not himself and anyone who doesn t know the history of JonnyGuru but is a fan of GN is quick to throw Jonny under the bus for Nvidia s mistake
like an adult lol irony
3080 3080Ti 3090 s power delivery design ended up severely stressing portions of the GPU VRMs in worst case scenarios NVIDIA improved the power delivery design starting with the 3090 Ti It s overkill to be using 1200W PSUs for the 4090
I have an EVGA P5 750W platinum paired with a 12700k and 3080 and I ve had 0 issues so far Maybe just bad luck with the cards or psu
Is the choice of words bullshit what caused the chain reaction Or was it the overall they are wrong
Oh shit imagine ruining your reputation so badly so quickly jonnyGURU a guru no more by the looks of it
what's wrong with TP
It can do 600W Assuming it is properly installed and connected to an 850W power supply
Thats is And what about the new cable they sell Time will tell i guess Certainly bad PR for them
Yep Part of it as well can be marketing Something I just decided to do was look at the pin out diagram of the Nvidia connector and mostly what I found was IO Its possible this connector has features that Nvidia hasn't implemented yet If they want long term adoption of this pinout then they need to show us its better then the old pinout and not for the sake of being different So on some levels yes I agree but its complected
lol
slave mindset Who the fuck talks like this other than certain obvious idiots
So sad you didn't understand and completely missed the point First nobody is talking about what you can or can't do in your personal life that is not even close to what we are discussing here it's about being professional if you think the other part is wrong then explain it respectfully keep in mind that you are representing the company in your statement because of your high ranked position If you want to make an opinion then say it so clearly this is my opinion either way you have to be responsible for what you say and deal with it if your company doesn't agree with you Btw insulting and offending people is not an opinion
There's a bit more than that After learning he was wrong he shared some choice words about NVidia ass clown moose fuckers
They absolutely do considering that he was confidently incorrect
Maybe not for an internet rando but for a department head they are definitely unacceptable
Can tell you in a professional setting saying bullshit is pretty bad and you can get sent to HR for it internally in big corpor Doing it externally as the head of R D Y
I feel like he's just emphasizing on the unlock aspect of the claim from a stock performance perspective Card works with three cables perfectly because that's what it is designed for Any unlock will not happen because there actually isn't any for a 450W card hence the last sentence
It gets worse after that and steeve tries to pitch in
Exactly it looks Nvidia lead him to believe that And him being the head of the PSU division should have that much confidence
Reminds me of myself I hope people could say the same about my outbursts lol
Honestly I'm out of the loop so after reading the post title I assumed something vulgar rude racist was said but after reading these messages it literately just seems
Right What a joke People just looking for drama lmao
Well it doesnt suite well at all on papper where everyone can see it Having Corsair as a company in mind and the person being top tier in Psu department Saying bullshit in someones face or phone call is ok I guess as long as its not recorded grinning face with sweat
when corsair described it as an outburst and GN quoted total bullshit i expected flaming this is hardly an outburst
Yeah I'm reading that and like So uh what's wrong here
Let's rephrase the Head of PSU R D was blatantly wrong about their area of technical research and called an independent review which turned out to be correct bullshit That's not exactly a nothingburger and that's not exactly the type of person I'd want making my PSUs
No he's absolutely right about what Jay was saying About what Steve was saying though Yeah he was quite misinformed
okok EDIT Still Johnny GUru would be the last person you'd think to get a take down from youtubers like that
Calm your tits son Everyone fucks up once in a while Now your hero and someone that had built some reputation throwing a hissy fit and get owned on the internet for some time happens every time give it some time No one give a moose fuck about BDR stupid phrasing to HUB after a year or so with the editorial bullshit TL DR nice drama let me taste some of that shit
Gamer's Nexus is one of the most respected and knowledgable PC game hardware reviewers out there A wise person would triple check their facts before calling bullshit on them
I think we still can consider him an authority He's been dealing with these exact types of connectors for decades idk you'd think someone of that stature could make a cable from the provided specs and had the customer sign off on it instead of throwing a tantrum for not getting a sample product
Nvidia told him they were only using 1 of the 2 sense pins on the connector so he was operating based on that knowledge You'd expect an Nvidia Engineer to provide very accurate information to the lead PSU Engineer for a large PSU company so I get why he would be confident that what he was told was right compared to what third party reviewers claimed The only real issue here in my opinion besides Nvidia clearly being terrible to work with they didn't send Corsair any early units for testing was how he publicly attacked the reviewers' credibility on this
Sure I suspect that is indeed what happened But calling other peoples' work total bullshit just because you are misinformed is a bit much
His blunder was assuming something was true rather than testing it himself Which is ironic considering he got to his current position by being the guy who ignores company's claims and tests shit for himself
Expert from company who makes cables to provide exactly the functionality he is disputing getting it wrong calling bullshit is pretty bad Be like an expect from Goodyear claiming your tires do not operate on concrete but work on asphalt
To be fair it could be some other jonnyGURU working at Corsair
I'm not doubting his recommendation I'm just expressing that he's someone whose input I've sought out in the past
It depends on if the recommendation was based on the issue at hand If he was unaware of how it worked made the recommendation based on flawed understanding of nvidia specs Admittedly because nvidia is as transparent as mud with their card specs even with vendors then you might want to question what you bought otherwise yeah probably fine
I could not believe my eyes when I saw it
Well guess JonnyGuru is just full of shit about how much he knows about Power Supplies then
He was fed wrong info by nvidia apparently lol
Well it may or may not be I can put a photo of him as my profile pic and say some stupid things but that doesn't really make it so I'll be interested to see if it is though
Sure I'm not debating that fact I'm not sure that the person who made the statement was him though Just because they're using a photo of his as a profile pic doesn't necessarily mean anything one way or another I'll reserve judgement for now
Gotcha Thanks Miss JG power supply reviews and most newer computer fans never got to experience them Point of me commenting was he was is much more than some Corsair employee If anyone would be on a dream team for PSU it would be him Even if he was wrong this time
I hope does learn from it he's no doubt good at it
Glad to see some actual sense in this thread Nvidia did some non standard bullshit with their adapter cable didn t tell anyone about it and now other people are getting in shit for it because they JGuru in this case are making perfectly reasonable assumptions and ending up wrong Instead of using the sense pins like every other cable manufacturer to handle power limits on the new 16pin connector they ve got some inline IC that detects how many cables are plugged in and bases it off that As for the Corsair cable it s good for 600w easily It uses Mini Fit Jr HC connectors which are rated for 15A with 16awg wire which leads to a theoretical max of 1000w over the 6x12v wires in the 16pin cable To get 600w is only 8A load on each cable well within spec given the quality of crimps and wire thickness
No they re just wrong Corsair s cable has 2 sense pins
The 600w cable has both sense pins and will deliver the full 600w
They re wrong it has the correct sense pins to deliver 600w if need be
It s fine because that person is just wrong
I wouldn't stress about it If it's problematic I'm sure they'll send out replacements I'm kind of waiting to see a definitive answer on all of this as there's lots of conflicting information floating around at the moment
Even in Jay's video the card maxes out at 100 instead of 133 like in the Gamer's Nexus video Not entirely sure how it all works
IIRC it does not have the proper IC's in the cables that are required for the GPU to get a signal telling it that it can go beyond 450w even if the cable itself can
A company can have employees with different opinions and expertise Crazy I know
this is a horrible horrible approach and a poor logical fallacy if you dont condemn it absolutely you must absolutely support it it's the same logic that pits people against each other in political discussion if you dont like trump you must be a democrat a company can reserve the right to reform an employee just because the internet dives in and says FIRE THEM doesn't mean a company should do so it's a stupid precedent there's better value in teaching a person they were wrong giving them a chance to reflect and improve and move on if you dont fire the guy that said 'total bullshit' your company is now 'total bullshit ' mmk
Free market working its magic You guys like capitalism right
Since when is a company not wanting to be seen as hostile vulgar and blatantly incorrect the same as cancel culture
Agreed This will be the tech subreddits faux outrage for the week lol
not the most professional statement ever
I've been saying that the Corsair cables lack the proper IC's in the cable to let the GPU know that it can go beyond 450w Not the grounding pins
Yeah I have a Dark Power Pro 12 1200w and I've been waiting for their cable too It was supposed to release today but I haven't seen it anywhere as of yet
Well maybe not those games but they'll largely leave it as is The gains from overclocking a 4090 are super minimal so they aren't missing out on much really
I see Thanks for the information good to know
That's a tough question I always recommend choosing your PSU for the maximum possible load you could see with your PC think Prime95 Furmark You want 100 stability not just this probably won't trip OCP in most everyday use conditions And in fact personally I would add another 20 on top of that We know a 4090 set at 600W can actually draw up to 666W in certain cases A 12400 can draw up to 147W according to Guru3D That already puts you at 813W Throw in a motherboard a few SSDs and a few fans and you'd run right up against the edge of your 850W PSU Would it work Probably Under gaming load you'd be well under 850W the entire time But it certainly wouldn't make me comfortable to know that I'm within a few watts of my PSU's limit if I have some unusual circumstance pop up that pins both my GPU and my CPU at their power limits Nvidia's 850W recommendation seems to come from an expectation that you won't be overclocking or unlocking power limits 850W is more than enough for a 450W GPU for most users But for a 600W unlocked one it' to say the least even if you do happen to be pairing it with a lower power CPU The transients aren't a big deal Any quality properly designed power supply should be able to handle short transient spikes well above their actual power rating
12400 peak power draw is 117W with some motherboards allowing higher In gaming I regularly see 95W or higher Then the motherboard ram fans drives etc all need power too The power supply and the devices are lossy 750W load on an 850W PSU can easily actually push it over the limits Finally those figures are maximum sustained load Transient Spikes are certainly possible on all components If they're high enough for long enough OPP or OCP can take the PSU off line Conversely if you manage to get 600W sustained on a 4090 while gaming you're OC'ing and should be actively aware of the power envelopes at play You're more likely to see maximum sustained loads around 400W All together even with a 12400 an 850W PSU is awfully close to the limits Not dangerously so but you'll see plenty of extra heat fan noise wear and tear and maybe the occasional OPP or OCP kick in and or system crashes
Artificial things are real too The definition of artificial is made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally especially as a copy of something natural In this context the naturally occurring limit is the electrical limit that arises as a consequence of the design of the connector though there could be an argument that such a limit is artificial as well if we found out that the connector was designed to that target rather than the limit being determined after the fact If Nvidia and or PCI SIG then proceeded to arbitrarily set their own spec to 150W I'd consider that to fit the definition of an artificial spec But then again this isn't a linguistics sub and linguistics isn't my area of expertise Call it what you like I don't think it matters much to the overall point
It literally says 600W cable though Isn't that misleading illegal labeling
Do you have a source or are you just regurgitating BS you read on reddit other forums
You might want to delete or edit your comment as you are spreading false information That cable utilizes both sense pins You can see it here t 166 t 166
Go watch it again It caps out at 100 AFTER he removes one of the two pins It has two pins stock for 600W
Doesn't matter as long as they're both grounded it'll interpret that as 600 watts The standard uses those two pins either open 0 or grounded 1 to define maximum power limits and allow compatibility with legacy hardware Sense0 Sense1 00 150 watt 10 300 watt 01 450 watt 11 600 watt The other unpopulated pins are for the ATX3 0 standard supplies that can communicate more than just that table and for now don't actually matter for any current use case
You think Corsair is going to sue a random reddit commenter for linking to their product page and asking a question
How high do they go 106 works out to like 477 watts
And yet Linus came out of that with a positive net while we now know sometimes Steve overeacts
Death by overclocked RGB with benchmarks ofcourse
Make sure both are sense cables
Gamers Nexus recommended it You should go hang out in r corsair where you can continue to downplay a real issue
Two cards is not bad luck I do laugh at the downvotes People can be so stupid about hardware failures if it doesn't happen to them Gamers Nexus covered the failures and you still deny it You should go hang out in the corsair subreddit
I think the most inflammatory word and the one that is causing the reaction is misinformation Beyond that it's the tone used Had he said something like That's not my understanding from what Nvidia has told me corsair it wouldn't have blown up or even been reported on addressed in a video
Little from column A little from column B Being wrong is the real issue but being wrong in such an arrogant fashion just multiplies the issue
The issue is he called out GN G3D for misinformation when in fact it was he that was misinformed This can have a cascading effect as other media pick up his quotes and muddy the entire situation His position in Corsair meant his words carried insider weight behind them especially when he's calling out journalists media who are often targets for hate and it's damaging to both GN G3D AND Corsair when it turns out he was wrong GN has a pretty good reputation for honesty and thoroughness so at the very least he should have asked nVidia to clarify GN's claims before declaring it misinformation on a public forum
didn't come across to me as particularly arrogant everyone has bad days
from JohnnyGuru to JohnnyBooHoo real quick
No one s reputation is ruined here Nvidia fucked up and everyone is tired of their shit especially Jonny considering all the other misinformation that s been going around lately surrounding ATX 3 0 12VHPWR
I'm confused a guy just posted that for those cables to do 600w u need a a 1200W rated CORSAIR PSU
Technically both GN and Johnny were right which makes the drama ridiculous this article explains how the sense pin in question works on the Nvidia adapter it works differently on Corsairs
They are using and following the exact same standard pinout of 12vhpwr spec but the only difference is adding an IC which will switch to 450w mode from 600w it acts like cutting off one of the sense wires artificially when not all four 8pin are connected even if each of your 8pin can handle 300w or more Because there is no way for the GPU to know if you are using a substandard cable or a 300w PSU from 20 years ago But if you know what you are using there is no point at all for doing this logically
People who got boundaries and do not let being stopmed on I am not familiar with the situational but regardless what's been said it shouldn't be apologies for by the company even if some harsh words been used That's is the problem of modern society there is no free speach we all preach about Its just correct one way of saying doing things just not to inconvenience anyone People mentioned some of swearing but yet again it's not a journal talk it should be free space to say whatever your opinion is by not being bombarded by right people
Lmfao this dude should be promoted to head of advertising Buy the new 4090 you ass clown moose fuckers
Just need EVGA to thumbs up that message
I mean is he wrong about Nvidia
This seems kinda funny and not like it should induce internet rage
o no baby what is you doin
Dude probably had a beer too many and got upset So he's mad at Nvidia for giving him incorrect information and then he repeated that wrong info to the detriment of his reputation Inartfully worded sure but I'd be mad too
So his comments towards GN actually weren't bad at all he's just calling NVIDIA ass clown moose fuckers Seems pretty based tbh
That seems like an appropriate response as well
That sound pretty fucking on brand for nvidia
deleted 0 2905 What is this
The greatest pig moose fucker mind I've ever known
There's a bit more than that After learning he was wrong he shared some choice words about NVidia ass clown moose fuckers To be fair I'm with him on this He just said out loud what everyone is thinking
I mean have you ever seen a moose Them's some fine lookin horns just saying
Hope when I m in my 50s I don t speak like I did in middle school
Then he's just misinformed Those messages really don't look bad Who hasn't argued a point and then realised they were wrong Mistakes happen
He can be incorrect sure but they don't look bad at all lol
I don't see how they would warrant Corsair making an official apology
Confidently incorrect people are the worst kind of people
so what That gets you a post on r confidentlyincorrect These really aren't that bad this is completely overblown
No he wasn't he's the head of R D at corsair Nvidia shared the power plan with him but they don't provide the actual card to the PSU companies for them to set so they just have to take nvidias word for it But on the launch day it turns out to be something completely different Imaging spending months on R D and designing a PSU then screwing them over by not giving them a GPU to test
It's absolutely okay to be wrong about something no matter who you are We're all human Sucks he swore but he didn't make any accusations didn't make any personal attacks or anything beyond using the word 'bullshit' Again sucks it happened but this could absolutely be forgiven by anyone who's been wrong in public discourse before
Yeah but I hope he isn't fired JUST for saying bullshit lol
Is this an American thing I feel like every meeting at work theres an unmitigated clusterfuck or absolute crock of shit being thrown around If we couldn't so much as say bullshit half the company would be gone before lunch That said we got bought by a huge American company a few years ago They do seem awfully polite so maybe
Bullshit
I've never had any issues telling my higher ups that things are bullshit Where do you work
To be fair he did lash out at GN because he believed what Nvidia told him
especially if it in any way is mentioned as recommended for some of that hardware What isn't a nothingburger is him publicly calling out Gamernexus and Guru3d and calling into question their testing and credibility Especially with the later screenshot where he then puts the blame on Nvidia for him being wrong and getting in trouble nvidia giving the wrong impression excuses the being wrong part He still called people out in an unprofessional manner and is unapologetic about it
I mean while it's not a great look most of the times I've been in a chat like this people spew a lot worse nonsense Like he should obviously apologize to Steve but it's not some massive deal imo Seriously do we all have to be ultra fragile now or something
Jay was saying Is that talking about the 20 cable connections
How Jay and his content are absolutely fine
Did you respond to the right person If so this seems like a bizarre reply and I'm not sure you understand my comment I'm just saying this isn't really a big deal and quoting some of the silly things he said
Guru3D is more than ten years older on advanced hardware reviews they've been doing this since 1999
Yep that's the same thing I said a few comments ago I understand the mistake I just don't understand how Jon is apparently so sure of himself that he didn't bother to recheck his info when Gamer's Nexus is the one contradicting what he was initially sure of Hell if Gamer's Nexus came out and said something completely unrelated to PCs and in my line of professional work I'd still want to triple check my sources before even implying he might be wrong
Gamer's Nexus or rather Steve Burke is a fine youtuber but he's not an engineer or an expert in anything except making youtube videos His videos are often clickbaity and the criticisms within overblown not only because it makes for a better more profitable video but also because he doesn't completely understand the underlying physics electrical engineering I'm not saying he's a bad guy or that he's intentionally misleading but as with all online experts his words should always be taken with a grain of salt
E The Corsair 12VHPWR cable is every bit built to ATX 3 0 and PCIe 5 0 specs Both of those spec documents literally have a provision in them for when the sense pins are hardwired to be locked to a specific configuration which is what the Corsair cable does The problem is that Nvidia applied the spec in a different and altogether rather unexpected way rather than hardwiring the sense pins for 600W like literally everyone else does they put an IC in the adapter that senses the number of cables plugged in and adjusts the sense pins to dynamically configure the adapter based on the number of cables plugged in This fact was not obvious at all and there was no technical communication about it just some vague consumer facing infographic about how you shouldn't or can't draw more than 450W on 3x8 pin And if Jon didn't get a sample product then it's a very reasonable assumption for him to make that the Nvidia adapter is also hardwired He didn't do his due diligence and was kind of an asshat about it and I'm certainly not putting the blame past him for that But it's not down to his technical knowledge
Maybe I'm misremembering but I don't think he said that in his video did he
Oh yes the way he handled is unacceptable But considering how little info Nvidia sends to their own AIBs pre launch I doubt they have given PSU makers much info briefs on how they would handle the adapter situation I can also see there being some bad blood between PSU folks and Nvidia after they tried to pass off the launch RTX 3000 series transient crashes on bad PSUs LOL
Nvidia never sent Corsair a card though so how could he test it
Not really more like if a single car manufacturer did something never done before on their vehicle that changes the way their wheels and axles work and an tire manufacturer isn t fully in the know It s an overblown issue over a personal DM regarding a spec that s insanely confusing and very new
It was a genuine question as I did not know Well that s Intersting I am pretty sure Steve and Jonny have done collab vids in the past
Well I don't think what he was saying will be impacted by the addition of the IC to the adapters Corsairs power supplies can still handle the wattage he was saying they could They will still work with the adapters Corsairs 12VHPWR still signals the card it can deliver 600w of power Jay test it I know Jay is wrong about a lot but I mean testing is testing So I'd still think his recommendation for PSUs are fine His behavior is uncalled for and he looks a fool but I'm still happy with my decision to go with Corsair for the 4090
With comments like We are not going to be on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's lap on stage so I don't want people to speculate what's going on when we're not there EVGA CEO via GamersNexus t 490 source Tom's Hardware It's not hard to believe
Did he just call them moose fuckers Lol Not very professional but it sounds like he got EVGA'd That sucks
Well corsair has confirmed it was one of their employees Do you suspect another employee impersonating the head of PSU R D
I don't think Corsair would release a public apology for statements from a fraudulent account but
let him stick to talking about PSUs seems like he caused enough damage by talking about GPUs
They're not getting in shit for making perfectly reasonable assumptions They're getting in shit for not doing their due diligence and saying other people are wrong and their work is bullshit without actually verifying anything That's a big difference
whew thanks
I just skimmed the video If you look closely before he cuts the first sense wire the power limit is set at 100 450w but the bar it is on extends past that almost certainly to 133 600w After he cuts it it's still 100 450w but the bar stops there so he cannot raise the power limit So it seems like it's working correctly prior to him cutting the sense wires he just never set the power limit at 133 when he could have
Only when he disables one of the pins to test
It does Jayz video testing that made it very clear
The IC isn't required The IC adjusts which sense pins are grounded But it's not needed if you just ground them directly with the cable
The GPU only looks at the sense pins That's all it cares about If they're both grounded it gets 600W The Corsair 600W cable will ground both sense pins when both cables are connected as they're hard wired and the GPU will get the higher power limit ability The Nvidia adapter is special It has a small logic IC inside that checks the number of active inputs and if it sees 3 it sets sense0 open and sense1 to ground which will tell the GPU it can pull 450W If it sees 4 inputs it sets both sense0 and sense1 to ground which signals to the GPU that it can use 600W
it does not have the proper IC's in the cables that are required for the GPU to get a signal telling it that it can go beyond 450w Nvidia used the IC for safety reasons so that you dont use a single 6pin for 600W But they fucked it up just plug the 6pin into the 3rd and the 2 into the 4th connector and you get 600W with just 3 cables You could probably use just one daisy chain 6 2 cable for 600W by plugging the 6pin and 2pin into separate connectors on the Nvidia adapter If one wants fire they can molex to 6pin and 6pin to 2x 6 2pin 600W through a single 18 22AWG cable let it rip
I'm not saying that they can't I'm just pointing out that it's a poor analogy
Nope You are who you associate with and tou certainly are who you pay to represent you They dont give a shit
Since people think that someone saying dumb shit online is grounds for the companies that you allegedly don't care about to fire them I'm surprised the whole damn fiasco hasn't devolved into armchair politics and philosophy yet while throwing fancy Greek words that they just learned recently to flex their debating screen behind the fucking monitor Trust me if I was the HR I would try to fire him The fact stands that despite the genuinely no brain all ego quip about a fucking cable and having an entertaining meltdown he is still probably a little bit better informed about power supplies compared to your average Redditor I ain't throwing away asset if I were them
shrug
And I literally told you in a different comment which you seemed to accept that the IC is not necessary utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 You can go read the ATX 3 0 specification document if you want Start on page 26 The only thing required for a 600W power draw is for S3 and S4 to be grounded It says nothing about an IC In Nvidia's case the only thing their IC does is to ground the pins It's not doing any form of communication with the card other than to ground the pins
There is no naturally occurring limit with a spec Laws of physics are the only real limiters though Cost and time to manufacture are always drivers They weren t designing to physics limitations of the connectors or wire gauge They were creating a spec for designers to design to and manufacturers to make supplies for
Mine shipped the MSI Gaming Trio card that I got only has a 3 x 8 pin adaptor included so I was always going to be limited to 520 watts or whatever
It's all kind of up in the air at the moment so we'll see how it pans out I wouldn't buy one until people are sure how they'll perform though
Well I don't think they did it intentionally if that's the case There's a lot of information going around about this some of it conflicting so I'd just wait to see how it pans out before buying a cable
Why don't you go ahead and spend some time looking this up for yourself
I don't trust Jay for shit tbh He's the idiot who started the whole Poscap misinformation when the 3000 series released Once someone actually reputable comes along and says something definitive about it I'll change it
you think sue able means they going to do so
The MSI Suprim X goes up to 520 watts and the MSI Suprim Liquid X has a 530 watts max limit
How about I stick with the PSU wattage recommended by the actual hardware manufacturers They know the 4090 GPU and PCB inside out and they have actual skin in the game There s no risk Gamers Nexus is taking by recommending viewers to purchase way overspecced PSUs Seasonic and Corsair are offering their own 12V cables for users with 1000W PSUs to go with the 4090 Do you even know what most likely killed your Ampere cards Those design flaws don t exist in the 3090 Ti and Lovelace cards
I didn't say it couldn't happen but if the vast majority of people that have these cards have no issues then it just it just means you got the bad luck of the draw in getting two faulty cards Also the only thing of Corsair that I've bought was an SF750 Platinum and I didn't have issues with that either and mine wasn't part of the batch of faulty psu's either
It's barely an outburst unless there's more to the conversation than this screenshot
Er all he had to do was check with Nvidia before slandering GN No JG fucked up massively
Who posted that
Corsair says you should use a 1200w psu but that doesn't mean the cable won't work This is more of a use a 1200w psu in case transient spikes high wattage cpu overloads a lower wattage psu
Insurance reasons Actually literally Most tech companies have insurance agreements that follow the design while being engineered and are willing to give adjustments to safer designs Insurance in case of a recall and a mass fires break out They don't want to pay millions in legal fees so they would rather pay a few hundred thousand dollars to adopt a technology that comes from the partner company
I am not familiar with the situational Then stop right there
IKR We can all get behind that rant I am sure Looks like NVIDIA is pissing off more companies than just EVGA
nope pretty damn on brand of them to leave people in the dark for a while
Coach Carter
coach trev
I'm surprised there's no conspiracy if this was the part of Jensen's master plan to hype up cable extensions or something
You joking This is the head of Corsair R D publicly calling out another professional and saying their work is bullshit when in fact they themselves are wrong about their own product It s not a private argument and therefore represents Corsair Furthermore to call it bullshit is unprofessional Not to mention it s literally their job to know this shit If you remove a couple of those things it would be reasonable but all together is unprofessional and embarrassing 1 he should have fact checked it before brashly making a public statement 2 he should show respect to other professionals and not call their work bullshit 3 this should have been discussed between them in private Those are all actions they could have done easily while still making the mistake of being misinformed and it would have been fine So there were 3 things they could have done differently while still being wrong and maintained professionalism Those 3 things I listed aren t mistakes They re shitty habits that speak to a lack of professionalism and lack of character Period It s embarrassing you and others are defending them
While I do understand where your point is coming from there s way too many people who go online vehemently arguing a point and are incorrect And when corrected they won t back track apologize delete original comment etc They ll just not say anything They ll leave their original incorrect post comment tweet etc and move on And guess what They ll do it again and again That s the issue we re dealing with when it comes to this online space we all share collectively
Misinformed A normal individual Forgivable R D head at one of the leading global PSU manufacturers Nope
Maybe he should fact check before bashing others This is not the first time this kind of stunt happens and it probably won't be the last
He publicly calls the reporting of a tech news channel that prides itself being highly technical and scientific misinformation incorrectly That is very bad and it is damaging to the reputation of GN and Guru3D Mistakes happen and this is a big and ugly one
The dude isn't some random pleb posting on a dumb account that nobody cares about on Reddit If it was then this wouldn't be news
Corsair are putting out an apology mainly for PR reasons Is this entire thing overblown Maybe that s for everyone to decide as individuals But in the corporate world saying something is bullshit when it isn t and then spreading misinformation for it all to become public is a pretty big blunder when you re that high up in a company
His position at Corsair is pretty high they absolutely would have to apologize for the head R D for PSU s misinformation
He's THE Corsair PSU Guru I met him in Fremont He's really passionate about what he's doing and his knowledge about PSUs is out of this world
That is everybody sometimes
Tech Jesus handled this completely reasonably by saying Well if you apologize and recognize the true information as true then apology accepted and we can just put all this behind us I feel like the community should take a page from his book This is not a big deal it's already all settled amongst the parties who were actually involved
Again in a public leadership position at a big company you should know better He probably won t get fired but it s not the type of thing you do
I don't have that issue either now at least in general with higher ups It's usually the peers who get offended and think they're right and can't back it up x200B I said it once in the context of some guy saying he wanted to be a different role but his actions in his current role made that counterintuitive he sucked basically His manager who didn't like me wanted to report me to HR and asked for my manager's help who was also his manager She said no deal with it My manager told me to watch my language and I kinda did going forward because there's alot of people in corporate environment who have different takes on languages That manager was useless and fired anyways shortly after The guy I called out bullshit on eventually went to another group and got laid off there Also wtf is up with people posting shit and then deleting the post I get the message in e mail and they're quite silly
Nvidia wasn't even wrong there Their engineer was just smarter than jonnyGURU and was able to implement the connector in such a way that it set the sense pins correctly depending on the number of 8 pin connections present The crazy part is just because jonnyGURU wasn't able to conceive of this solution himself he outright dismisses it as magical and BS
when you speak as a representative of a business you you know represent that business calling an independent journalist's comments bullshit is absolutely not acceptable behavior your random chat is not comparable to that
This is absolutely overblown I was expecting so much more
Yes
No Jay's content especially in this context regarding the adapter cables is not fine it's overly fearmongering and betrays that he has a clear lack of understanding of the topic Jay is just good at presenting himself as an authority when he isn't There were a lot of conclusions he drew during that 12VHPWR adapter video that were wrong based on information taken out of context and without really knowing how to interpret it Among other things he presented the thermal variance advisory as a piece of evidence that adapters were unsafe when in reality that piece of information was about the connector in general under rather extreme use cases and had nothing to do with adapters whatsoever He also claimed that drawing 150W from a single 8 pin was unsafe when that's been shown time and time again to be false His overall recommendation was that nobody should use the adapter to connect a 4090 and everyone buying one should go out and buy a new PSU That's horseshit Practically every single relatively recent high wattage power supply is more than capable of powering the 4090 especially with the included adapter which is the most safe option aside from a true ATX 3 0 power supply at the moment given its smart power limiting based on available power plugs
It's silly That's why time to stir up some moose shit while it's still steam fuck piling hot
Literally both parties involved in this drama are far more trustworthy than linus for PSU reviews Also ngl this feels like a poor trolling attempt with defending gigabyte products especially faulty ones acting as if corsair is the top end of quality and plugging linus as a better source than anyone all in one comment on a 4 hour old account
Lmao if that's what you took away from the faulty gigabyte psu scandal which they were faulty btw then you're about as delusional as gigabyte were You really need to rewatch those videos if you missed 90 of the information in them v Xts3pvbcFos
If he couldn t test it he has no place to make a comment about it
Yeah totally apologies if that came of sarcastic
pretty much everybody says some dumb shit time to time happens
yeah if he controlled the initial outburst and contacted the press for clarification it wouldve been better but now he doubled down and blasted nvidia too lol
Well I guess then that JonnyGuru doesn't know nearly as much as he pretends to about Power Supplies then
Fair enough I suppose this just means that JonnyGuru doesn't know as much as he let on about power supplies then
You know what they say about assuming Definitely made an ass of himself
What was the exact power draw You don't know because he never measured it He was going by the program saying 100 or 130 not an actual number The Corsair cables don't have IC's in the cables that send a detectable signal to the GPU which then knows that it can go past 450w
I think the analogy works Company employees are usually still very diverse
Who said anything about caring or not caring about the companies The public opinion doesn't matter it should be in the company's best interests to not be linked with shitty customer service Publicly talking down to your customer base and the press that supports them is a terrible business plan unless you're a joke social media account
You seem really into this whole topic Why don't you go find another person who is also equally interested in it so that you can discuss it I am not that person
He is wrong It has the two sense pins required
Cable works fine it has 2 pins the 2 that are missing are the ones that do the crosstalk with the new atx 3 0 standard useless for and adapter made for atx 2 0 At least this is what i understood from jayz video What matters from that video is that the 4090 gets the full 600w with the cable
Got it you're regurgitating BS your or someone else made up I actually did try to find a source before asking but it doesn't exist
Jay is an idiot and I have to watch his videos on mute but it doesn't change the fact he clearly shows that the two sense pins are wired to ground That's why I said see and not hear
You've made so many comments in this thread alone spreading false info it's legitimately baffling Instead of actually owning up to it you tripled down on your mistake Jesus man
That's not what I was asking I'm genuinely curious if you think corsair is gonna sue a redditor for linking to their product page and asking if the cable does or does not support 600w
Apparently it's a fluke that it defaults to 480w limit with 3 cables Should be 450 Oh well that works out I haven't been pushing the card to max usage in anything yet without jacking up the resolution to 4k
Did the Suprim come with 4 to 1 adapters
How about I stick with the PSU wattage recommended by the actual hardware manufacturers I am not sure what is wrong with your ability to comprehend But GN confirmed those recommendations were not adequate due to transient spikes That is literally the entire issue and you still refuse to admit GN wasn't lying
You called it bad luck when GN has tons of messages from people who had the issue and publicly reported on it It's a real flaw confirmed by GN
Why would he check with them His information is from them GN has already accepted Corsair s apology and I guarantee there s no personal ill will because everyone knows how difficult Nvidia is There isn t much more to argue when the people involved have already moved on
Yes I totally agree and understand why Nvidia is designing the adapter this way because they can't control what cables and PSUs people are using with their GPU This is 100 fine and correct as a GPU manufacturer But if you are using a modern up to standard PSU simply don't need or use the adapter as it simply won't give you any benefit but just an extra possible point of failure All the problems here are those tech reviewers and YouTubers spreading wrong information or they simply don't know what they are talking about misled the public to believe something which is completely false like extra power is in fact complete BS
I am replying to the commend where its believed its the company's business what employees discuss on forums It is a bad attitude and it seems grown deep into society since its been told as a positive thing from the very childhood just to be obedient
He pissed off something he doesn't understand
Point 2 is the most important I think It doesn't matter who is right or wrong in this topic it matters that he started insulting the work and people I mean if you come home and think someone did bullshit tell your wife how much you hate that person or whatever but at least act with respect to others in the
They're defending him because they're not very smart people and are interpreting the situation as if he's just another person making a reddit post or twitter comment N 's meant to know what he's talking about and not publicly display his own incompetence I am not a quantum physicist If I were to make a mistake regarding quantum physics people wouldn't see that as completely unreasonable However if I was a professor in quantum physics then my displays of incompetence would be quite a bit more concerning It's scary people have gotten to a point that they can't differentiate 'professionals' from random people on the internet And why we have to hold both to different standards
aggreed he should act like a professional and talk to nvidia and gn if he found their talk was incorrect not bashing on social media
I'm sick of incompetent people like this using titles and clout to talk down to people who they perceive as weak GN is not weak Get fucked Fuck the Corsair former head of R D
I agree the way he communicated wasn't correct but he only knows what he's been told by Nvidia themselves It's Nvidia that screwed everybody here
It's not that serious R
when in fact they themselves are wrong about their own product If you read further down it appears Nvidia mislead him about how their own product worked and he took them at their word documentation Then he blew a gasket because he expected their statements to be right and they weren't and he looked like a fool because of it
Gamers rise up
If saying that something seems fishy gets you fired then I don't want to work at your company in the first place
Reddit moment
Congrats that is an impressively exaggerated level of white knighting
Lol wtf Dude was wrong about something so dumb and everybody makes mistakes
Dude made the product according to Nvidia's specs He was only misinformed because the official information misinformed him This is nothing more than a passionate overreaction in response to Nvidia doing what I might say in a professional capacity provided him with incorrect information and in an unprofessional capacity I would say are indeed ass clown moose fuckers
Why would he fact check His facts were from Nvidia they gave him bad info that wasn t correct and failed to provide him a card for testing so he could verify for himself This is just a man who s sick of Nvidia s shit and he s not alone Definitely not the first person to have some very public choice words about how Nvidia treats their partners
Yeah Gamers Nexus didn't read Guru3d's take was spot on you can say whatever you want about stuff but as a representative of a company taking a shot at a established reviewer is a different matter I mean ultimately it should be solid wrist slap to JohnnyGuru not to be an incorrect blowhard who is dumb enough to take an escalating shot at the press and be wrong about it in the same time but nothin' more than that Unless he makes a habit of it or something If they were to lose their job as some have been 's the extent of a termination the company itself is probably pretty rotten
so you see this baby This is our new PSU Yeah man it powers a computer like a beast just flick this switch and it turns on amazing right Obviously there's more to PSU tech than a switch before someone educates me on the intricacies
Yeah except here he sounds like an ignorant boomer too full of himself to actually research before he runs his mouth because he s way smarter than everyone else when it comes to power delivery So he makes himself look like a big dumbass lol
True But I'm talking about the people that are that always
Exactly This is how it should always work
He's not talking out of his ass he thought he knew something and was wrong If he was making it up it'd be a whole different case but just being wrong about something is hardly noteworthy
Exactly He could have also looked at Igors Lab's article video where he explains how exactly the dongle works which also confirms what Guru3d and GamersNexus said about it
I ll agree with that The camera man is annoying but that s not jay
Well he was going off information Nvidia told him
Jonny Guru is quite possibly the most knowledgeable person about power supplies in the world He became legendary for the quality depth and technical detail of his power supply reviews then proceeded to join Corsair and manage the team that designed arguably the greatest power supply ever made the Corsair AX1600i But he's a power supply engineer working for Corsair not a graphics card engineer working for Nvidia This specific fuckup was seemingly due to the fact that he didn't realize that there's an IC in the Nvidia 12VHPWR adapter that can sense the number of cables connected thereby communicating either a 450W or a 600W power limit to the graphics card It's not just a passive adapter cable like he's probably used to Corsair's own 12VHPWR cable seems to be passive with the two sense pins hardwired to ground so he probably thought the Nvidia adapter was the same thing And all of this seemed to have been led on by the fact that Nvidia fed them misleading and vague info As an electrical test engineer myself given the info provided I could easily see myself making the same mistake So then the question becomes whether you trust Steve enough to question what you thought you were sure about I do Jon evidently didn't So I can fault him for not bothering to double check his sources and being so confident in his own impression of things that he immediately came out to accuse GN of spreading bullshit But even now I certainly can't claim he isn't knowledgeable about PSUs
I mean he is likely very well educated on them He just let his ego over inflate too much and made bad accusations Given who did the review it was pretty shitty he went with such inflammatory language instead of just saying that doesn t sound right
His only assumption he made was that the info he got from Nvidia was correct They didn t provide him a sample so he couldn t verify it personally
All the IC does is ground certain pins The card doesn't even show the slider option if both aren't grounded The card is obviously detecting when both are plugged in or not and responding accordingly I don't know why you are insisting the IC is necessary It's there on the adapters so the card doesn't try and draw 600w from 1 cable or something stupid like that The card needs to know how many cables are plugged in hence the IC is necessary for adapters but not for other solutions
Then stop spewing nonsense even when corrected The answer to you being wrong then doubling down being re corrected isn't 'ahh I dont actually have interest in that topic' like that is pertinant info If you're not interested be quiet
You just can't take being wrong
of course not it was said just to emphasize how wrong this dude is
I don't know what sort of accessories they come with as I dont have them nor have I looked at any reviews of them
Show me in his latest 4090 review where he suggests viewers to purchase a 1200W PSU The transients on the 4090 is similar to the 3090 Ti Those didn t require 1200W like you re fear mongering His old video covering GPU transient spike carries stale information That video was produced when no one in the public knew the actual efficiency levels and transient behaviors of the 4090 GPU
Why would he check he's right before calling something bullshit that has video proof Gee I wonder
I see Perhaps I'll look at it on that perspective However I still think it has something to do with cable communication I have a feeling the power connector is going to one day communicate with the PSU for power needs much better and it's possible they need to start adoptiong the tech right now which is is a dumb mistake because we don't benefit from it right now so it's not needed
Your lack of understanding about the situation is exactly why your comment is irrelevant and wrong in this context The original post by the employee is their head of R D at Corsair The guy is not 'just anyone' he is at the very top And he wasnt just talking on his own 'after working hours' He was actively engaged in discrediting a reviewing organization GN in a public forum about their understanding of his specific expertise at Corsair power supplies This isnt some poor kid who just misspoke outside of work at all This is why your posts in this thread are being properly downvoted
I think he's pissed off because he said something incorrect and then tried to back it up but then realized that he was incorrect because nVidia never gave him cards to work on just an engineering spec So he never got to play around with the cable on an actual 's what he's calling nVidia out on here my read of the situation
Yeah the more I read about this it really just makes Nvidia once again look like the assholes not really giving a shit about their partners lol That said I'm not at all excusing his behaviour he should have known better than to speak out like that publicly especially when having the title he does it lacked any professionalism It just seems like in so many of these situations misunderstandings misinfo etc You can always find Nvidia somewhere at the start of it
Or maybe you're missing the whole story Nvidia didn't send him a cable or a card and the diagrams they provided him were inaccurate Nvidia is to blame for everything other than Jon responding unprofessionally which is 100 on him
They're defending him because they're not very smart people They think other viewpoint because they're stupid I have no horse in this race but really They see the same information as you and have a different perspective on it Make your point without having to insult others
they're defending him because they're not very smart people Wow what a strong argument backed by facts I can't believe more people don't use this as an opener person facepalming
It's scary people have gotten to a point that they can't differentiate 'professionals' from random people on the internet And why we have to hold both to different standards Because these types of people are still teenagers or those at university college than those in professional settings
Being a professional means you can never be wrong or just wrong in public I think its hilarious you chose a scientific profession to try and illustrate that point which has some of the most famous examples in history of public displays of mistakes and professional bickering Physics professors are often wrong about physics and this should not concern you They learn and adjust
Johnnyguru was gamers nexus for psu's before gamers nexus was a thing Dudes track record prior to this is pretty damn sparkling including helping gn set up their psu testing in the past Dude fucked up and then doubled down which wasn't the smartest move but everyone has their off days Arguing on a public part of the Internet is just almost always a bad idea especially if you are a public figure I would be not be surprised at all if the spec from nvidia is exactly as he describes it leading to some different questions
Wasn't that sub just a racism and bigotry meme dump Let's not do that one again Gamers sit down an keep gaming on
Woosh
I'm can only hope that dumb arrogant dicks don't work at my company
Or quite obvious sarcasm whooooooooooshing by you
First pretty sure he was being sarcastic not the comment about NASA wasn't calling out NASA it was just a joke about firing a person into space Third just to take your point at face value it could be a management issue as well at Corsair The problem is that the person who was saying all this IS management at Corsair Specifically he's the Head of Research and Development If it's a management issue then it's his management and there's not really anywhere else to point a finger at that
Older worker with a title and all the money but doesn't know shit Talks down and generally has an abusive attitude and management style Had this coming I'm suspect of anyone defending this shit
He was the top PSU reviewer for years and years before he became their head PSU guy But he's not a GPU guy so frankly I think he was just out of his depth here and never actually tested the GPU and repeated whatever misinformation he had heard
but he was wrong
People are trusting GN here because he's backing up his case with proof If he was making baseless accusations people would call him out You're not being critical you're making smoke without a fire Don't be surprised when people don't like what you're saying when you don't have a leg to stand on Also it's funny how you walked back your comment about Gigabyte's false statement once the lie was pointed out
Exactly the point He has made a living by NOT just believing what companies say but by actually testing them first hand Hence my point Really shouldn t put it out there if you haven t tested it yourself Especially if he started saying all these negative things about how nvidia have done and or does things and how they operate but yet you go and take their word for it Seems to me like he was more focused on looking for an opportunity to say GN was wrong than on how credible nvidia statement to him was Furthermore GN showed they had a working scenario and TESTED it on video wouldn t you think he would ve seen that and thought I haven t tested it GN has and it doesn t match what nvidia said to me maybe I should find out who s right before making a statement This is why to me it seems like he was more concerned with pointing out GN mistake which wasn t than verifying what he was told
I know exactly who he is thanks Nobody is infallible though Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things either way I don't have a Corsair PSU so I have no horse in this race
he couldn t verify it personally Then he should have kept his mouth shut
Luckily for me it rarely happens
You're such a clown dude Holy shit
I am not digging through the videos mentioning the topic to find that one quote This is more than enough to confirm you are lying t 1639 If you want to find it in one of the videos possibly this one he says 1000 for 4080s and 1200 for 4090s may be a good idea
OK I give some leavay on that Probably I overreacted Seeing all these employers wanting to control their employees inside and outside of work
Yea maybe that 1 thing but nvidia doesn't has an obligation to send him a card The manufacturer not only corsair but a lot Everyone sending 12vhpwr cable prior to launch with correct spec but why only he blatantly false and blaming nvidia
He didn't say stupid he said not very smart Not very smart also means simply not a professional He could have used better word choice like not a professional in that field but he didn't really insult anyone or say stupid Not very smart is more of an average or a very slight positive than a negative Stupid is much more of a negative Make your point without having to insult others I do so yet I'm downvoted to deletion Thanks for downvoting me people I guess it's wrong to say you shouldn't put words in other people's mouths
Johnnyguru got diagrams from Nvidia backing up his story He was forced by Nvidia to create his cable without Nvidia providing a card He stood by the factual information provided by Nvidia and basically was fucked by Nvidia
Well that's kinda the point It's become a meme for when people have nutso takes
I don't know about any racism but usually it's just a response when 'Gamers' get all high and mighty about stupid shit I think it's an appropriate reference given people's response to this headline about a product they likely don't own and demanding his firing Dude was wrong He said some silly but mostly harmless shit and apologized Meh I like Steve too Steve probably isn't overreacting like the thin skinned neckbeards in some of these comments Edit no need for a recall It seems the product provides 600 watts as intended it just requires a 1200 watt PSU and both cables to be plugged in to the GPU
Then better that your company doesn't grow enough to need CEO Or at all just to be safe P
Have you never been wrong
I don't understand 'talking out of your ass' to mean 'in any case that you are incorrect' but we all live our own lives
Unfortunate that what you please is being confidently incorrect and willfully ignorant but I guess to be expected
Mhm You spelled loco incorrectly pal XD I appreciate your input though you irrelevant internet nobody
That video is dated three months ago It has stale information like I mentioned in the above post GN produced that video without having no idea what the actual 4090 behaves The actual 4090 s power efficiency is actually good enough for TechPowerUp reviewers to use a 850W Titanium rated Seasonic PSU to review the 1000W recommended 4090 Strix without any problems They even managed to overclock the 1000W recommended Strix to nearly 3GHz frequency Thanks for proving my point by linking an outdated now irrelevant GN video thumbs up
Finally home This is added to Megathread Individual threads are no longer locked Check out my comment for explanation utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 If there is any notable information within this post please tag me so I can add them into the Megathread Thank you
Has Nvidia said anything officially yet It kinda seems like we are seeing more and more of these reports it's been picked up by virtually all the big tech tubers seems like a recall on the adapters and a public apology is the minimum at this point Happy your card is okay OP
did you smell anything before
Is nvidia really planning to go ahead with the RTX 4080 16Gb launch amidst this debacle
These things should be recalled
Just removed my 4090 and went back to the 3090 got return for full refund so will likely do that Can t deal with these kind of problems for that kind of money
The fact that Nvidia still hasn't called a recall for this adapter stuns me
its like one or two cases per day now this is not rare
Is this a 3 or 4 pins adapter Also which Gigabyte is this I am outside right now but will add to Megathread when I am home Thanks
I am packing my 4090 until nvidia comes back with something Period
Same card side panel off just checked and no problems so far but I must have spent 10 minutes making sure connector was in super snug Fucker will likely pop when I'm playing something like Zomboid instead of Cyberpunk
Yeah fuck this my Gigabyte OC went back in the box and if Nvidia doesn't sort this mess at the beginning of the week I'm gonna return it and get the refund I hope more people do this the lack of communication on such an important issue is baffling
Double seam pins again
The RTX 4090 is a fantastic graphics card but it s not powered right Having a failing power connector is confusing So we re pressing the relaunch button on the 4090 The RTX 4090 is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere with a better power connector soon Nvidia
Another one DJ Khaled voice
This is likely going to be a recall I got the specs for my ModDIY cable and it should be much safer than these I'm gonna use it when it gets here despite what MSI said about my warranty These adapters aren't safe and need to be recalled If someone is unaware of the issue this could easily lead to a house fire Especially once more time has passed and more cards are in consumers hands
WAs this happening to 3080 12pin for founders editions
This looks more like corrosion than melting
Not a single FE card have this issue yet
Been running the 4090 since before launch I've unplugged it at least 40 times for different reviews where I've needed access to the NVMe or the like Zero problems
Damn it packing away my asus 4090 for now until this is sorted out can't handle the stress My 1080ti lives on for a bit more
What are the chances of this causing a serious fire Because if there is even the slightest chance nVidia better end their silence and address this quickly or no amount of apology will ever suffice if this leads to an injury or even worse a fatality
I am so glad my Cablemod cable showed up the same day as my 4090 I almost didn t even buy the cable lol
At this point I think there is no more doubt that Nvidia needs to recall and replace all the existing cables that are already out there and sitting inside boxes The AIBs already had to be compensated for redoing all of the packaging for the 4080 12gb they are going to be really thrilled about this
It's very upsetting how NVIDIA isn't speaking out about this You think to save their reputation they would create a whole new adapter by now and replace any cards who have damaged connectors Shame on you NVIDIA shame on
Man I think the should just recall them and come up with something better This could really turn out bad
I d like to give a shout out to all 4090 buys for beta testing for the rest of us
Order the card but just make sure you don't use that adapter Unfortunately for us early adopters of the 4090 we will have to rely on 3rd party 12vhpwr adapters to get the job done Hopefully Nvidia will address this and have a portal where we can request updated replacement adapters soon Big stain in the face of Nvidia right now
They just keep coming and
Buy shares in Cablemod because all 4090 owners will be buying their cables
I wonder is this relevant for both adapters and native psu cables Igor's lab research suggests that poor adapter design is to blame Then solution would be to get third party adapter or psu cable I feel so lucky that I've talked myself into overpaying for international shipping to get bequiet psu cable on launch 'for looks' They went out of stock faster than the cards
super weird that non FE cards are being affected
Would it heat slower if you put the cable in the fridge before use
Aren't these cards supposed to go through intensive testing before being released to the market
This is so wide 't believe folks are still buying this bullshit
I hope the adapters for the 4070 won't be as
Checked mine this morning and thankfully no issues No idea if now me pulling it out to look and then reinserting it will be the thing that damages it Pretty annoying tbh
I thought Igor s lab isolated it to the cables soldering being sensitive to cable manipulation At least that s what I saw on Jayz channel the other day
Given how ugly these cables are and the lack of regard for how they fit in a case I hope Nvidia loses big here They should have put extra care into the cable Its like the only part that doesnt look premium for a product with a premium price tag
AIB model doesn't matter Nvidia's adapter is just shit
And shouldn t they just go and replace the computers their cards damaged I ve seen cases where the motherboard got damaged too
User error
Just a simple question is this enough material to sue nvidia Your house can burn etc
I feel nvidia is taking too long to address this issue I am sure they are able get some sample gpu from the aib to test it out
Oh c'mon another one Damn
Honestly if your going to buy one of these cards I'd say you'd nearly be better off waiting until they release the PSU's that have the same power connector on them as the GPU and not this 4x adaptor carryon At least then there's less strain on the socket itself
Damn This is the second Gigabyte OC card then the very first one was a Gigabyte OC too While the card itself does not seem to be the cause based on speculation of causes so far all the cases have been Gigabyte OC Asus Tuf and MSI multiple models Maybe these companies got the bulk of bad cables or something perhaps Asus especially is over represented with 50 of cases being ASUS TUF cards
I m increasingly suspicious that evga left the game because of extreme fuckery behind the scenes at nvidia This might just be the tip of the iceberg of build issues we will experience as the 40 series ages
I am a computer technician we encountered chronic problems but we have never faced the risk of burning thousands of people's homes in 2 3 years I have never seen this in my entire career I have 15 years of experience I don't know what's causing it but it's clearly a chronic problem nvidia should recall all cards not safe You leave your computer to render and sleep and bum fire the danger is too much Never mind the hardware quality manage with any gpu don't use rtx 4090
I'd be curious to know what case you have the 4090 in I'm wondering if you bent the 36mm they said not to bend Not accusing you and I don't think it's acceptable if that would cause burning anyways but i'm just wondering if it's a contributing factor potentially I know the 4090 barely does not fit into a lot of cases if you properly leave the 36mm space so a lot of people are just bending them anyways
Yup thats another
NVDIA must send us new cables This is 1600 GPU Some peopel have spent more than that Class action lawsuit will happen
The lack of communication is a disgrace there is a real chance of a major disaster due to this being a fire hazard Time is of the absolute essence to create and provide a solution from Nvidia
Never been so happy to not have the latest RTX
Hey OP be sure to forward this to US government agency Consumer Products Safety Commission via
Might not have a working adapter now but at least you still have your life and your home
I don t understand why anyone that is aware of these potentially faulty adapters are continuing to use them on their 1600 2k due to scalpers GPU s Save yourself frustration and get an ATX 3 0 PSU or a cable from Cablemods
I'm curious as to why the adapter on the gpu side hasn't been looked into more There could be inherent problems on that connector causing these plugs to heat up I sure as hell hope that's not the case
It always seems like its the outer corners that burn up It never seems to start from the center It seems like it's always one row too not both
It s clear and been proven by Igor s Lab the nvidia provided adapter is the issue
Time to lock it up
Big text YouTubers were talking about this pre release A new graphics card is not worth your house being turned to ash
I guess they're not locking threads anymore rofl What a bunch of dbags
Here before locked
It's incredible the amount of failures we are seeing in here It's also unbelievable the amount of people willing to take such a huge risk by running any 4090 at this point even with the cable mod adapter I mean Seems like driving round in a car with no seat belts just saying you'll take it 't predict what's coming round the corner
Don t use the adaptor fam Upgrade to new psu with native support
We have a ton of cases on the Gigabyte Asus and MSI Peculiarly Zotac PNY Galax Colorful have zero cases so far Are the Asian AIBs doing something differently that they are not suffering the the same problems
I bet aib partners messed up the pcb somewhere How come no FE models any problems yet
2022 human still have bad connector
I still think the GPU is drawing more power on some pins than others and not evenly distributing the wattage among pins I get Nvidias adapters are having some poorly soldered connections which could cause this too but this isn't even a Nvidia adapter Also if it was just the adapter why does Nvidia want all affected cards sent to HQ
If it's Gigabyte run like hell That's a one megaton blast waiting to happen
I dunno looks a little crusty
what were nvidia
When are you idiots going to buy a proper ATX 3 0 PSU or get a proper cable
I bet its not only the connector
That connector is for the motherboardface with open eyes and hand over mouth
Fun fact first one to burn their house down will have a FAT CHECK FROM NVIDIA on my way to pick up 4090 right now plug it in use it as nvidia said too and well minus well call me the owner of nvidia
Karma Buying a so ridicously expensive card with no more reason from nvidia to make money will come with a sentence
Is this for 40 series cards Highkey if you bought one already you had it comin'
Something tells me Nvidias adapter supplier didn't cut cornered in quality AiBs probably used different company to save a few pennies and this is the result
Is there a megathread Shouldn't you just post it there Seems a little spammy at this point
Why the heck are people buying 40xx series cards I feel like they've turned into the call of duty of the gpu world
Man i want my 3090 back
Where is this megathread Am I overlooking it You'd think it'd be linked whenever mods hit the padlock
Unfortunate that this had to happen
What case do you have
Ah Shit Here We Go Again
Was it bent or did it happen regardless
I have the gigabyte version too So far mine is perfect and only have 3 of them hooked up instead of 4 which idk if that makes a difference or not
I used to come here every now and then but now I m here several times a day because of this shit show Wonder when Nvidia will make an official announcement Hope your card is okay though
Oh hey why haven't the mod stickied that he added this to the 16 Pin Megathread and yada yada yada
I'm ootl can somebody fill me in I only understood that the 12 pin connectors seem to be faulty
Got a 10cm moddiy 4 8pin to 12vhpw ALONG with the cablemod 1m same style kit that's a month away That's 200 Canadian for cables
Does anyone with third party adapters face this issue It could be an ATX 3 0 PSU cable or cablemod Corsair etc
Alright so at this point in wondering could this be a problem with the plastic itself used for the connector I mean people are not doind anything out of the the ordinary like running stress tests 24 7 How can this happen
You gotta wonder what the rest of the electronics looks like that is covered
My 4090 has been running RIFE AI since I got it on release day pulling 340w I have been worried about
This one is interesting the heat buildup was over 3 pins many other examples it was just the outer single pin Your terminals don't look bent something more is going on here almost like the GPU is pulling power in an unbalanced fashion across the 12 pins
Daaamn that looks bad
For that price they really need to be ashamed and send you all free cables
Just bought my 4090 today not putting it near my system until I get replacement cables from cablemod Nvidia send out replacement cables
This is Horrible
Finally the mod didn't lock the individual thread to control the damage thank fcking god
Is that the provided octopus adapter
Damn nice catch that was probably 1 more benchmark run away from a random unexpected combustion event lmao
As someone who just bought a 3060 Ti FE is this something I need to be concerned about since it has an adapter Or is this just a 40 series issue edit 40 series not 4000 series
i have been hearing about this corsair adapter i always thought that a single 8pin port would max out at 150w and the corsair adpater is 2 8pin only for 600w was the 150w limit for the cable only so what's the limit on the actual port on the psu i have a 850w gx focus plus gold from seasonic which has 6 8 pin that are both for cpu and pci e will it bare 300w per cable i will use a 450w card 4090 trinity by zotac anyway but just asking
Checked my windforce cause you guys made me worry It was fine but now that I messed with it it'll probably melt Haha
This has all my curiosity piqued as an electrician It's like the pin isn't rated for the amperage
If you have a PCIE 5 0 power supply is this all a mood point As you wouldn't need the adapter right
Nvidia needs to redesign all these cables and then make them available free of charge to all 4090 owners as soon as possible or give a option of a rebate refund so we can buy correct cable from places like CableMod
Same card is there a replacement cable that is confirmed to be safe yet or wait for the 90 degree cablemod adapter
Ouch that HURTS Nvidia really needs to fix this problem like asap
Just got a gigabyte oc today from Microcenter and the associates recommend 2 things buy the replacement warranty and don't use the included adapter in the box The other day I was able to find an MSI a1000g pcie 5 PSU so I bought that to use the single 16 pin cable
For those with a 3080 ti 3090 ti it's good you didn't get this card yet Yeah the adapters are burning but not worth risking burning your house down 3080ti fe and 3080 12gb strix owner here Might build a 3060ti fe build for my girls
I have a big case and the cables adapter still need to bend a little against the glass So silly that the adapter isn t angled 90 degrees downward to relieve both tension and cable management
glad my cable mod cable for my gigabyte card came in Paired with my EVGA 1000w hopefully I won't have any issues going forward
This burn looks so odd
I'd be keen to see how much power these cards are actually drawing The Gigabyte ones for example are supposed to run at both 450 600 watt and if it's pulling close to 600 watt it might make sense that poorly seated connectors are causing it to melt With my 4090 I've not seen it go past 350 watt even in prolonged gaming sessions it's connected with the same 4 dongle adapter also I'm sure I've seen on here some other guy saying he was running stock and it also melted but I'm not seeing massive power draw on my model It's not even undervolted just straight out of the box I'm holding on to mid November when I can get a new ATX 3 0 1200w PSU but yeah not ideal having to worry about potential melting in the meantime
Almost impulse bought this card with the geforce experience invite been kind of glad I didn't these kind of reports would have given me too much anxiety
Use the magnifier app light and let me see the inside of those connectors for scoring
You lucked out catching it that early If it s not already obvious to anyone here discontinue using your connector if it s appearance changes even a little bit like this
Full worldwide recall of ALL cards is a real possibility The smaller connector is a fundamental design flaw
So I need to check my Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC I take it I'm at work and nervous to go home and check At least I always turn my PC off when I leave the house Edit Just checked it no signs of damage yet Hope my be quiet PSU cable arrives soon so I can feel a little safer
Sooooo how long til recall
Phew Thankfully you checked and none of the melting occurred on the actual card I had remembered reading about this being a problem months before the card even released there were leaked documents and so I pre ordered one of the new power supplies And as things usually go for those who prepare for the worst I got the PSU a week before the 4090 launched and yet I'm one of those people out here still struggling to even get my hands on a
God this is getting bad I'm scared for my 4090 now Got the card since launch msi gaming x trio with a 3x8 pin adapter and I did a lot of benchmarking the first week and played a lot of games running flawlessy so far But I'm scared to remove the connector to have a look for any signs I'll just stop gaming I guess until I get the angled adapter from 't noticed any burning smell 2 weeks in so 't think it will catch fire while web browsing I'm using a hx1000i 2022 version black label power supply along with the matching cablemod cables So that should be 'm using right now that came with the 'm really scared to launch a game
rare gigabyte w

Nothing from nvidia as of now Maybe their investigation dept is on leave
Nope Nothing from Nvidia
I m really glad it s alright Gonna be putting it away until my cablemod cables come in Will also be vertically mounting the gpu
Well problem is that nVidia has no replacement adapter yet so what is the point of recall Just say don't use your card for the next 2 months I bet nvidia will admit it once they have enough replacement adapters produced
I had read that they requested partners return all affected cards to them for investigation But they are going to need to do some PR soon
nVidia is collecting cards and adapters and investigating the problem right now They need to confirm the problem 1000 because issuing even one single fix that doesn't work would be worse They'll probably start talking about it this week
Just the adapters Does this not also fry the cards
No it just works s
They wont say anything until revision 1 0 is ready so they can sell thenneq cables face with tears of joyOK hand
Came here to ask the same Nvidia silence sparks for itself on how they KNEW this was an issue and dismissed Jays concerns Ima hold on to my EVGA 3080 and hope Team Red comes out swinging performance to price ratio
that's a weird way of saying happy birthday
Yes Jensen made a comment in our internal slack Thanks for the Money Suckers
100 their legal and PR teams are evaluating everything right now
I work in quality engineering for a company that makes electronics They are probably simultaneously sending components back to suppliers reviewing design fault trees doing recreation testing and drafting countermeasures They will probably release some short term software change that reduces performance and risk of damage for the short term and will release new hardware within the next month or so
Unlikely on the weekend Probably Tuesday or Wednesday one can hope
No smell or smoke I randomly checked because of everything going on
The white on the connector indicates it was just approaching glass transition temperature so smoke vapor release is still unlikely at that point PA Nylon has a good amount of fiberglsss in it and it doesn't tend to actually straight up catch fire

4080 should reuse the 3090 TI's 12VHPWR to 3x8 pin adapter so no issue
That should be fine Its the same wattage the 3080 used So Only 2x8 pin in the adaptor like all the other 30 series used The 4090 had a brand new 4x8 pin adapter
I just reinstalled my old vega64 it probably was a bit more painful than just going tier lower on nVidia card flushing drivers changing cable to DP1 4 but I will wait until cable for my PSU come time to check older titles P
I like your style
dont try to play the gamble we are just less than a month in whatever fix NVIDIA gonna do to 4090 it is gonna be a band aid Since you got 3090 might as well skip entire generation to RTX50 series
Smart move
I will keep using my msi 4090 if it melts it melts
How about those 3rd party adapters
They don't give a fuck with the pricing so I guess they just don't give a fuck too about customers
They're just now receiving the first cards what were reported as damaged They still have to investigate the failure and identify the root cause and identify a solution I don't expect anything from nvidia for a few more weeks
The weirdest thing about this is back for the nvidia shield tablet they issued a warning about battery that could overheat and replaced them all And back then I couldn't find any report of it actually happening This time the fire hazard is much more obvious and should be taken way more seriously Even other makers should have issued at least a warning already bad press is already there no need to wait for worst possible outcome
Most common thread is bending it horizontally
And its contained mostly by minorites in reddit More users out there who dont know shit No wonder nvidia keeps quiet
4 pin It's the Gigabyte RTX 4090 Gaming OC
I ordered cablemod cables Gonna stash the 4090 until they come in
Just did the same thing this morning Back to my 2070 super until the cablemod cable comes in
This is how you died
In theory that should not be an issue but it seems that everything is wrong at this point that even the most stupid tiny detail can be causing issues
MSI says that if you use the Cablemod adapter it voids the warranty F that No way that they would know either unless you told them so I guess it doesn t really matter
Any idea how MoDIY cables are Ive never tried them myself
3080 doesnt use 12VHPWR connector
Oof good point
Same for Steve from Hardware Unboxed and I suppose basically every reviewer since we never heard anything about this in any of the reviews And I'm sure the reviewers also put far more stress on the connectors through constant use than any of the customers
Does he want the 3090ti back yet lol
slim if the plastic the connector uses is fire retardant as it should be

EVGA knew wanted nothing to do with this dumpster fire
I just bought a power supply that is atx 3 0 A few different options available at this point
I bought the cablemod cable before I even received my card Wish it wasn't going to be another two weeks until it ships
Was keen to order one of the cablemod adapters but it'll take at least 3 weeks to ship out this way by that time I can just pick up a good ATX 3 0 PSU with the dedicated 16pin connector Ah well guess I'll just wait
I almost ordered cablemod cables before I had the card in hand Kicking myself now for not just doing it as now I ll have to wait a bit
Not a card problem it's the it doesn't matter if you have FE Asus msi or anyone
Could be that the cards were but not with the adapter
There seems to be some competing theories on the internet Bullzoid believes it is a pin inadequate connection spec issue Problem with that is the same connection is used by other adapters cables no problem Also Nvidia used the same pins in other adapters also without problem It is most definitely something solely related to the adapter tho since afaik those are the only ones melting
About 5 years ago I had a gigabyte motherboard that appeared to have caught fire overnight I had usually left my PC on Thankfully the case was metal Surprisingly none of the components were damaged like cpu memory graphics card etc
The only damage so far is to adapters not even the cards or burning down house You would probably get a new adapter
You'd need 500K to sue Nvidia
In America you can sue anyone for anything but in order to win you need to for example have actual losses and someone to blame for it A burnt cable isn't that
You can only sue if you have standing If it hasn't burned your house down yet you probably don't have standing
I think the reason might be that the Gigabyte card significantly outnumbers the other cards out in the market
Look at this fanboy subreddit downvoting you Omegalul Surely they must be pissed after having been ripped off of so much money coming from an already overpriced 3090
Lol it s not the cards themselves Please stop spreading BS It s the adapters that are shoddy and failing
we should be getting free fixed cables from nvidia demand it from them where should we ask though
I have my side panel off and the weight of the 4 pcie cables naturally pulls it downwards a little bit Having it perfectly straight would probably require a hook to counter gravity
It s a LianLi O11D evo There s plenty of room but I went through a few different styles of cable runs while installing the card to see what would fit the best It might have been during this period when something happened inside the cable That being said I definitely didn t mangle the cable and tried my hardest to not bend it
One source Still unconfirmed
TSA approved lock
Same
Are we sure native PSU cables are good enough tho
Me too
Smaller volume Also Could be that they do not get reported here or on western social media
There s only one MSI 3 pin instance that I ve seen
Because there are a lot less of those going around don t you worry it will happen to those too
Except this is an Nvidia adapter
None of the third party cables from Cablemod Corsair and BeQuiet have melted It's something to do specifically with the Nvidia adapter Instead of crimping the terminals they used poor quality solder which detached even if you bend the adapter even slightly The third party vendors use a far superior crimping solution The workaround IMO for those with the adapter is to literally allow it to trail out of the case at a straight angle Do not bend it even slightly and if you must bend it even outside the case do it vertically Do not use it with a side panel at all and don't twist it horizontally Straight out of the case until you get a native cable
This Good old fashioned pcie 8 pin can carry a massive amount of extra wattage over actual specification almost double and is tried n tested If they had just went with 3 4 cables this would be a non issue Instead they chose to fuck about and now were finding out
Palax showed they pumped 1200W through nvidia adapter until it reached 100C its not the power its the cable
Cards have been out for a few weeks and there was no way to know until the past week or so that the adapter was defective Also this is happening with ATX 3 0 PSUs so your point is totally invalid
No name calling plz

Yeah you re right I should have been looking for karma waiting to punish me for spending my earned money in the way I wanted to My fault really Glad the purchase police could educate me Thank you sir ma am
No AIB are using nvidia branded adapters
Mods are collecting user posts in the megathread
It will likely be a linked comment when this post is added like with the others My post has yet to be added EDIT A mod has commented stating it would be added when they re able to later
I am outside atm and it s a pain to add to the Megathread with mobile Will do that when I get home Once I add this post to the Megathread there will also be a link here Thanks
I am outside Reddit mobile is a pain to add to tables in the Megathread Will do that shortly when I am home
Seems to be the new ATX3 0 12v rails are defective somehow Either the card is drawing to much power and basically melting the cables or the adapter for traditional ATX to the new ATX12v rails for the 4k series are ATX30 PSUs with the dedicated 12v rail for the GPU or the nvidia supplied adapter for old gen PSU to adapt to the new pin on the new 4k gpu's
I don't understand the moddiy website their 16 pin to 3 8 pin adapter photo has the 8 pin sides with the wrong plug on them it has the 8 pin found on the end of psu cables so you can't connect them together And their page for the 16pin to 2 pcie direct to psu cables says its for atx3 psu but atx3 should be a 16 pin to 16 pin plug So confusing edit not an adapter seems to be full replacement cable from psu to gpu it's short for the photo but you just need to select the length you need edit2 looks like their free shipping is 2 3 weeks and doesn't say what country it ships from either
Everything I ve seen looks to be the included adapter I hope CableMod cables are safe but haven t seen any testing I don t have a 4090 or cable yet but I don t think I would even attempt the adapter
40 series issue as the problem is with the 4 connector version of the cable
The 150W limit is based on the 8 pin spec but the cable can handle way more than that A 6pin PCIe is rated for 75W despite using the same number of 12V conductors as an 8pin But since the EPS 12V cables are unofficially rated for 336W 12V 7A 4 wires they build their 12V lines to handle both You can clearly see this in modular power supplies and 7A is not a lot of current to push through an 18AWG conductor 12V ports on power supplies are shared between EPS and PCIe so they are built to handle the stronger current of the EPS at the minimum The 12pin Gen5 connector has 4 additional wires used as sense pins to determine whether it can draw 300W 450W or 600W So either the corsair configured the sense pins to have a 300W limit or they cheated and put a higher limit knowing that the PCIe wires are their power supplies can handle it Yes pretty much all modern power supply cables can safely deliver 300W through their PCIe 8pins based on the wire gauge alone despite 3 conductors for 12V and since most are single rail who can deliver their full wattage though their 12V line you are fine as long as your power supply can handle it Although pushing 300W though a single 8pin WILL make the connectors slightly warm
Don't use it then what are you doing lmao
Either that or it's not making good connection I 's dissimilar metals in action
That is correct Good luck getting one tho
You are saying that the adapters are having the same problems on the 3080s and 3090s
How long did it take for it to arrive
Good You allowed someone with a brain to get a card At times even if I have a lot of money I can't help but think that it'd be better if the average person didn't have access to as many things as they do because their ignorance and stupidity shouldn't be rewarded with more than live work 9 5 debt die I'm sorry you get to experience this amazing tech Downvotes go
I wouldn't be so quick to assume this The 3090Ti used the same connector and could draw 450w over it with no problem While I know you can max the limit to 600w with a 4090 the stock limit is still 450w plus based on multiple reviews actually power draw while gaming isn't much over 450w even with the power limit maxed Unless every melted connector happened when people had the max power limit set and were power stress testing I don't think the connector size is at fault Also when using a different adapter like a cable mod one or a direct 12 4 to 12 4 cable those aren't melting yet they have the same connector size The only ones melting are the Nvidia adapters this points to more of an adapter issue than a connection size issue
I somehow missed all the early reports which is a bit of a bummer Good luck getting your hands on one Besides this it s an amazing card Performance is incredible and it stays cooler than my 3080 ever did Really excited for my cablemod kit so I can continue using it
If it's a 3x 8 pin adapter that must be one built by msi since the Nvidia one is 4x 8pin I'd be less worried if it wasn't an Nvidia one
According to Igor the very first card from earlier this week was being sent straight to HQ They probably just received it and doing their analysis
We are investigating the reports says Nvidia spokesperson Bryan Del Rizzo in a statement to The Verge We are in contact with the first owner and will be reaching out to the other for additional information That's from October 25th
It's the week end
They've been locking threads all day
This is what I expect if they had a response to why the failures are happening it would show they knew about it before it went public sale If they say we are investigating and that s it their stocks tank If they ask people to send in their cards and cables their stock tanks The best move is to say nothing and start investigating right away They don t want to ask for cards from people because no way that is not getting leaked the second they ask They have to ask the partners for their RMAs to get used samples from the real world without being public I m honestly just going to wait and see if they claim that this was a supply issue and that the product doesn t meet spec
Their investigation dept is on FIRE
Probably partying hard with the QC and engineering teams
RMA the whole thing might as well if you can then await the cablemod
All things considered I hope that cablemod comes out a winner here It's nice to see boutique style companies thrive NVIDIA needs to fix this ASAP bc this I think this is such a big safety issue
Probably a good idea Honestly this colossal fuck up in Nvidias part has made me less salty about being unable to find a 4090 Really really sucks you gotta sit on the 2500 GPU you just bought though But hey it beats an RMA
This is the dumbest shit I've read today and I've read a lot of dumb shit They still need to provide a statement or issue a recall immediately
This approach could pose a legal problem If they crank out a bunch of replacement adapters before acknowledging the problem it clearly displays that nvidia knows about the problem while not advising people to stop using their cards before damage is caused So it really just ends up with nvidia being responsible for replacing more cards plus any culpability in collateral damages caused by their neglect to notify the public while they work on a solution
Surely they have enough left overs from the 3090 Ti production which do work with the 4090
I think I've only seen one card so far that had the connections partially melted but I could be wrong If it happened to me I would still be tempted to do an RMA just to ensure there was nothing wrong I mean either way you are stuck not using the card for a number of weeks until a new cable arrives
No bad contact between terminals increase resistance which generate heat and melt the connector
It just melts no s
Yea that comment aged like well its too fresh to age like milk Still ridiculous
Ahhhhh shit
THAT'S worrying Means some people probably are having issues and they don't even realise it
I do wonder how many people who bought the card but don't fallow the tech sphere are in trouble Idk if PCMR and other large gaming communities are raising a stink but they really should as a PSA People need to be aware
Would you say it was securely and firmly in place
Could you smell what the rock is cooking
Welp now I m definitely gonna check when I get home
All in on green
Yeah I need Cuda for work so AMD is not and option but will likely return to 4090 once this sorts itself out Putting higher load on the thing that typical gaming workload 100 for hours at a time so very uncomfortable with the current power adapter No visible damage on it though so I guess that s good
What genres are you into Roguelikes tend to run on anything Hades Star Renegades Despots Game slay the spire griftlands monster train
I went back to GTX 1650 skull The card has trouble running even Victoria 3 in low details lol
hey another fellow vega 64 owner D mine is a sapphire nitro
Need Cuda confused face
It really sucks to go back to the 3090 4090 was so much faster at lower temps My kids are sleeping in this house though so I can wait
That's a bingo
There's been enough reports at the very least they should be halting sales and advising people not to use the cards temporarily at this point while they identify and confirm the issue They're just being negligent now
They knew about issue prior to releasing They test these cards
I would think that it makes more monetary sense for them to get ahead of this rather than try to ignore it It's very clear this is a real issue and if they end up getting sued them not being initially cooperative with their customers is not going to look good on them
That s not how recalls work Regardless if it s a nightmare you do it Otherwise you might have a few lawsuits and a destroyed reputation
A recall is better than the alternative for them lol
NZXT moment
B 's not users fault it is a design fault
This is correct
I have the same card I am using the native cable from msi psu atx 3 0 pcie 5 I have been running it about 4 to 5 hours every night I just checked it and no issues The faulty definitely has to be the adapter to be compatible with previous generation psu atx 2 0
Same here I order the C Series modFlex one for Corsair since I have a medium sized case Phanteks P600s I just hope it's a better alternative than the native nvidia one
Waiting for mine as well Checking for the official cable every day too
How were your adapter cables hanging before this happened Were you having the side panel off Do you have a pic Did this happen while gaming
The issue I've read about double seamed is that they are more prone then a single seam to spreading under physical loading so there's less clamping power to maintain a connection and that's when the heat starts to build
I mentioned CableMod and Corsair specifically Corsair even made my PSU They still said they could not guarantee they'd honor my warranty if I used either of those brands cables And they're both native 12VHPWR cables You're welcome to ask support yourself When they told me this I was pissed
They can't do that in the US Unless they can prove your third party part is what caused the issue with the part being warrantied they can't refuse the warranty This was settled decades ago and it's why we have third party car mechanics and parts instead of having to do everything through the manufacturer
I did some research and a lot of the people in the PC community seem to think they're a solid brand They had a few issues with their standard wiring when the 3090 ti launch but seem to have worked those issues out They're currently using 16awg high quality wire and the finest single seam terminals they could get their hands on Should be great from what I can tell If you check the reviews you'll notice a high volume of one star ratings but if you actually read them they're all from people who hand shipping issues during Covid So I wouldn't worry about that They shipped my cable after just a few days
This is a fuck up and they do need to make it right Jensen may also be a leather wrapped toolbox but he didn't make these adapters In fact I'd be willing to bet the decision to cheap out on them and use split pins never hit his desk at all There's probably six layers of management below him that were all clapping their hands and salivating over how many 'attaboys they were gonna get when they revealed they saved the company 04c on every adapter Those guys are now looking for who they can pin it on and it ain't gonna be Jensen
I've got the FE it is using small 12 pin Isn't it the first version of this
more stress on the connectors through constant use than any of the customers So much this Hardware is in and out of this system sooooo often it's not even funny I need to figure out different case screws for mounting the GPU as they've effectively stripped at this point the case steel stripped not the screw
I was more worried of the fire propagating the other direction since you can't control what board configuration people may have What may have been a low risk setup could become fatal I hope that's never the case
I think this is the right decision The community was calling for it and they were heard Thanks
Thanks for leave the discussion open thumbs up
If you made it custom you wait up too 2 weeks longer
Seasonic has a new one out around December
But there haven t been any reports of this issue with the FE card correct
The adapters are supposed to also Nvidia cut serious corners while simultaneously increasing It is ridiculous
The only damage so far is to adapters not even the cards I've seen plenty of power plugs damaged on cards What are you talking about You think the melted plastic was JUST the adapter
Someone s gotta take one for the team Let your house burn down
By the amount of fried adapters I've seen posted two weeks after launch I'd say it's only a matter of time until someone burns down his house with a 4090 I'm not even sure this can be fixed just be replacing the adapter cable the connector on the card could just be too small for the power draw
Not in Europe
Asus seems to have the most cases so far though But I think there could be something in what you say in the sense that these three manufacturers are probably the most popular available brands and are hence seeing more cases Edit Yet another Gigabyte OC now 3rd one
Probably because they are making very broad statements while also admitting they aren't informed on the topic in the same breath
Are there any cards without this power connector available
These are official products not 3rd party More information is needed and until we know more this card does not appear to be safe to use
I've seen plenty of pictures of the evo and 4090 and there is not plenty of room I have 011 D xl and there is not enough room Those cables were mashed against the side panel That combined with the shityy soldering inside the adapter is likely the cause
Igor's lab and Jayz jumped the gun last time in capacitor issue with 3080 it was just driver issue I don't think connector breaking is in anyway responsible for this I think they are pulling too much current from the last pin making them go above spec and that causes burning or they don't have heat dissipation on those pins properly
I don't think there's been any reported incidents of someone using the new ATX 3 0 PSUs with the dedicated connector From what I've seen online it's the adapter itself causing the issue because of its soldering I'm certainly hoping a dedicated single 16 pin connector straight from the PSU to the GPU will avoid these issues
Idk man crying face
Lol good mod
There's Suprim's in the megathread
Palax showed they pumped 1200W through nvidia adapter was the testing in a controlled open case environment what was ambient
Is it really I haven t seen any proof of that
Oh ok wasn't sure
Fascinating
Absolutely I agree I myself ordered this product id 6083 Looks to be a straight Nvidia replacer They have some weird options like pulling entire 600w 12vhpwr through 2 8 pin power supply side I'd get in touch with their support to clarify to be 100 certain
Going right into back of psu
Sweet thank you
so let's say that the Corsair adapter uses perfectly fine cables that can handle 336watts in each 8pin section but if i put that on my psu will it output 300watts from each port output or is it capped by the manufacturer
But I wanna play games
About a week but I was able to purchase the cablemod express which apparently they have a limited number of slots daily Cost me an almost extra 50
Thanks I really hope I can get one It's good to hear that it delivers great performance Hopefully that cablemod kit ships quickly
the nvidia logo is printed on top so it is made by them I think Anyway hope my card holds out until I get the angled adapter by the looks of it everyone is going to need it so nvidia should atleast provide every 40 series owner with a better quality adapter because the one from cablemod will probably be sold out in a minute
Analyzing the card achieves nothing because it's pretty much certain that the fault is with the adapter
Something like this should be sent overnight a company like this not doing that would be a travesty
Is this the article
The world we live in is not populated by adults but by emotionally under developed humans thinking they're playing a board game
I ll be contacting gigabyte to see what s possible
and stop the sales of any existing 4090 until the adapter is resolved
The 3090ti adapters were 12 pin These new ones are 16 pin
They don't work The 40s have sens pins to sens if plugs are connected with three of them you can draw max 450W and with four all 600W With only two or one connected the card will not boot
At this point if U have one then better check it out as no one is safe
The venn diagram of people that are buying 2500 GPUs and not following the tech news is probably very small
I m genuinely curious if a CUDA work workload would be better than gaming for not trying the connector With the assuming stable workload I m thinking there wouldn t be those transient high spikes
Reddit reports aren't really credible How bout people have some fucking patience and actually wait for an actual investigation Why is that so hard to do RMA your card if it has issues or wait for new cables
For like 10 minutes
It sucks that this got past testing and still no recall issued What the fuck is going on over there This launch is the biggest screw up I've seen from them in a long while
I don't think you understand what horizontal means
Thanks for reporting Btw how long was the card being used before you noticed the burnt Also were you gaming right before you saw it or was it a random check
What PSU And was the connector difficult to remove
I m sure it will be I ordered a vertical mount for my case so I ll be using that once those come in as well Just glad I didn t sell my previous GPU already
I had the adapter going over the card and slightly going right No photos unfortunately EDIT Side panel was on
Yup exactly they are more prone to have this issue In theory that should not happen if they used high quality materials but on this particular instance it can lead to a lot of issues The point im making is that is not double seams itself an issue but a byproduct of a larger one poor quality cheaped out adapters
How will they find out anyway Just take a lighter to the Nvidia adapter if push comes to shove
They're likely saying this because Nvidia is telling them to I don't see why board manufacturers would ever refuse warranty on their own terms
In that case id rather use the native adapter Why bother with the hassle if theres a chance theyre going to deny warranty on third party cables Remember AIBs are allowed to deny warranty on their cards based on their own criteria I have the 4090 X trio and iam just going to use the native adapter Ive gamed for 30 hours and no smoke so far I didnt remove the cable to check though but i suspect that a couple of hours is all it takes to melt plastic if you have an broken solder joint or improper contact If you're paying 1600 USD for a product then its better to go hold the manufactuer responsible for issues rather than try to fix it yourself
It happens a lot because it's expensive to fight to enforce the law
Happened under his watch Says a lot about his leadership Lack there of rather
While the adapters for those are also made by Astron just like these garbage adapters the ones for the 30 series had many different design decisions made which made them significantly better and safer First and most importantly they used proper terminals with only the single split which are more resistant to opening up compared to this pile of garbage with the dual split terminals Second the adapters on the 30 series used individual crimp terminals on each wire as is the proper way to do it with 16GA wire and running a wire for every contact On this they used 14GA wire with only 4 pairs which prevents them from being able to use crimp terminals since the largest you can fit in the connector is 16GA So the 30 series adapters despite being made by the exact same contractor were 100x better since they were using proper rolled crimp terminals with a single split which is just a smaller version of what the old 8 pins used Nvidia dropped the ball big time on this failed design and cheap parts used
Nope That is NVIDIA's custom 12 pin which was exclusive to the Founders Edition The 12VHPWR is a completely different connector and is standardized by PCI SIG Hence you will find this on all 4090s not just the FE but also AIBs 3090 Ti was the first card to adopt this connector
I went with the standard black Nothing custom
I don t believe so Might turn out to be an issue with how the AIB cards pull power rather than being an adapter issue Wait and see I suppose
I said this once the cable problem started happening the smaller connector is inadequate for the power draw on these cards They should've just used 3x8 pin connectors for 525W
Who pays for the lawyers then Or do you mean class action
30 series Only the 3090 Ti has the 12vhpwr connection But again it s the adapters that are the problem There is nothing wrong with the 12vhpwr connection itself
You can get a third party adapter or an atx 3 0 psu
How come no cases with proper cable then
Yeah those are all the 4x 8 pin adapters too Only once instance of a 3x failing and that one didn t even look the same way to me
Suprim's are 4 Pin Gaming Trio's are 3
I didn't order that one because it looks exactly like the nvidia adapter even has nvidia brand on it I was gonna order the 1 to 3 8 pin for direct to PSU but their FAQ says the free shipping option is 2 3 week ship time plus the lead time they have from the influx of orders might as well get cablemod at that point
It will output 300W from each 8 pin up until you reach the wattage limit of your power supply Any overcurrent protection needs to be higher than that since a CPU might draw 300W from the 8pin under normal use It s not the PSU that would cap it but depending on how Corsair wired their gen5 connecter it might tell the card I can only handle 300W via those 4 sense pins
I kno man I feel ya so much please don't tho this whole thing is shitty but an RMA would be absolutely devastating to deal with right now
I'm here gameless too we can get through it
Yeah they don t have that for the EU store unfortunately but yeah we ll see if it arrives before my house burns down
Oh it s impressive performance This situation has not turned me away from it Only has me wanting to be more cautious moving forward I ll still recommend the card just had a caveat now
Are the wires connected directly into the plug pins Are their multiple wires from each 8pin to the 12 4 pin Nvidia had a similar adapter for the 3090Ti that has 3x 8pins to a 12 4 pin but it uses direct crimp wire to pin connections and not the bus plain solder connection If you post a picture it would help But if it is the 3090Ti adapter while you will be limited to 450W but it should be reliable since there were no issues with the 3090Ti FE and melting plugs
if you use that stupid adapter with 90 degree cablemod you will still burn out the adapter
Companies are not going to just do well someone said it's the adapter let's ship new adapters and call it a day They want to look at all possible failure points and then decide how to handle it as they don't want to pay for new adapters and then find out the issue was actually something else I would not expect a response from Nvidia until later next week at the earliest It might take several weeks for them to have a solution that they can provide to us end users because it needs to be handled with multiple GPU vendors etc Most likely it's just some process to get a new adapter I wish at the same time they would also make it an angled adapter because the current one pokes so far out it doesn't fit nicely even in huge cases Now we basically rely on a 3rd party CableMod to provide an angled adapter
Sort of You also need to come up with a solution
the cards might have logs about how much power is flowing from the cables temps etc which they can analyze
In buildzoids video he does mention load balancing 40x treats the connector as one power source 30x treats it as 3 4 He was not sure if that would be part of the issue but my gut tells me it is If one connector is making bad contact the board should know that and draw less power from it and more from the others IMO
presumably the affected people also sent their melted adapter to the AIB nvidia as well
Assumption is the mother of all fuckups
One would assume so In any case it takes time to both investigate come up with 100 conclusion on the issue and come up with solution Personally I would hope we hear something next week but who knows Gamers Nexus looks to be investigating the problem independently too looks like
what an insightful comment
They shipped out a replacement very quickly to the first one which was a gbyte I think you ll be taken care of rather quickly
Let me know how responsive they are if you don't mind Mine is fine so far but I have the same card First time buying gigabyte
Should have added another 4 pins to detect if its on fire
Wrong my adapter from bequiet has two sense pins and I can pull full 600W Even on a 850w PSU
I ordered one from Be quiet as soon as it released thankfully no issue before I swapped it
But there s no other choice tho
Yeah just ordered the cable mod one but quite scar to pull it out
I have no idea but I can see that those workloads keep the gpu busy at all times while the load fluctuates more doing gaming Someone who knows more about electrical engineering would have to chime in Have been hitting my 4090 with heavy workloads for hours at a time with a cable that was bent horizontally and vertically at an angle with no damage at all so there s that 4090 TUF OC in Meshify 2 case with the Nvidia adapter Ax1600i PSU
There were rumours and posts about this prior to release
I started using it on October 15th Because of my job my computer is only on about 2 4 hours every week day but most of that time it is asleep I ve only done a couple hours of gaming since I got the card This was a random check No smoke or smell
That's the reason why it burnt Bending it horizontally will melt the connector This is how I have kept mine Was it tilted horizontally more than this
What case do you have Same card for me
They'd probably what I'll do if anything goes wrong with my ModDIY cable I don't want to risk using the standard adapter
It's just your stranded CYA for in case the third party cable is defective
In that case id rather use the native adapter Why bother with the hassle if theres a chance theyre going to deny warranty on third party cables Thing is Corsair's HX1200i is ATX 3 0 certified and their 12VHPWR cable is sold directly from them If they won't accept that then what's the point of ATX 3 0 Remember AIBs are allowed to deny warranty on their cards based on their own criteria They aren't allowed to deny them for arbitrary reasons though And in the US at least the tie in clause of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act forbids a company from making a warranty conditional upon using their accessories unless they can prove they're necessary to function It's a very important clause otherwise you could say be denied a warranty on your car for getting new tires Or say Asus could deny you a GPU RMA because you used a Gigabyte Motherboard Which would be horrible So no they're not allowed to deny you a warranty for this reason This said even if they are breaking the law and they if they deny you a warranty for say using Corsairs native 12VHPWR cable you'd still have to take them to court for the law to be enforced And I totally understand wanting to avoid that If you're paying 1600 USD for a product then its better to go hold the manufactuer responsible for issues rather than try to fix it yourself Normally I agree and I respect your decision to handle it that If this weren't a potential fire hazard I'd absolutely not use an alternative cable adapter But like if my house burns down I don't their going to reimburse me for my roommates dead dog How could they
It's thereof and this doesn't say shit about Jensen's leadership The coming response absolutely will for better or worse
Thanks for this detailed explanation nice to hear that
Interesting I need to get another 12pin for my 3080 from nvidia
Yeah mines gonna be two weeks too Good thing we didn't get custom lol hang in there tho I'm waiting with ya hoping maybe nvidia sends us better cables but I won't hold my breath
Class action yes I m not going to do it just a simple question because it seems like they don t care and that s not normal
Lawyers will take up cases if they can gauge that the suit will net damages and their fees ultimately comes from the settlement
The port is melting That's kind of a problem So all 4090s have this port that so easily melts with a cable that fits and it's official Sounds like a huge problem Board manufacturers are even saying using a third party voids the warranty They're willing to break laws to cover their ass but no problem Kind of egregious actually People need to know that this is a dangerous product Stop trying to prevent that
Nothing confirmed yet and it may as well be that the power connector is too small for the power draw Who knows
Probably less than 1 of 4090 customers are using anything but the default adapter
My bad I thought you were saying there was only one MSI GPU in the thread
I naively assume it's a correctly rebraided version of it with proper gauge materials soldering and I want the Nvidia IC that's apparently on it Fingers crossed stuff doesn't burn
are you sure cause corsair says its only compatible with what they call type 4 8pin psu's whatver that neasn there is a compatibility list some are not compatible some are only compatible with the cpu ports since they usually support more watts apparently and if i were to populate 2 cpu intented 8pins i would have 0 left for my cpu i could use other 8pin ports but they are not intended according to the manual still not sure what defines type 4 8pin psus and not sure if mine would be compatible but i really need to buy a new cable adapter casue even the 90 degree from cable mod won't cut it since it's about contact not really bending the male crimps have 2 cuts on the nvidia adapter and will probably make a weak or bad connection even on the 90 degree adapter which would for sure prevent damage on the actual gpu port but would still melt adapter and possibly cablemod end too if things go bad i think Nvidia gonna end up redoing the adapters with 1 cable per pin and with better crimps with just 1 cut like corasair is doing to improve contact surface but the manufacturing and shipping of this replacements will take at least 1 month so we will need to sort this by as i think they should do i hope they don't take to long my 4090 will come this
got a picture here I haven't touched it since installation of the card a good 2 weeks ago It's a hx1000i 2022 psu from corsair with cablemod cables the pc is running fine so
i'm not gonna use that thing when I get it all cablemod
In the mean time they should issue a statement whether or not it's safe to use the adapter I just checked my connector 4 times today and it only has 30 cycles on it Is it safe if I just watch movies on my PC and do productivity tasks or will it still burn The OP has only done light gaming and it still burnt Is it safe if I bend it vertically slightly Key questions nvidia needs to answer
They want to look at all possible failure points and then decide how to handle it as they don't want to pay for new adapters and then find out the issue was actually something else So you mean the QA they should have done before shipping these cards out I'm genuinely surprised that no one built an array of consumer rigs and just let it run The volume of melted connector posts leads me to believe no one is testing anything
The language suggests Nvidia is not asking for the cables just the cards Which means they are stalling
Nvidia likely knew about the issue before launch It s not like they don t do testing for months prior to releasing card
How is it that Nvidia or any of their partners had no idea that this was happening before they launched Don't expect me to believe that no one knew this was an issue and they are just now trying to investigate It would be amazing to me if the engineers were not testing their cards in real world scenarios like an enclosed case
Full worldwide recall
They simply need to inspect the terminals on the cards P S My answer is in the context of that comment there is no temperature load or power draw log stored on the card they need it to inspect what happened at the terminal coupling
I think the internal testing they did was on a prototype adapter which was built with extreme care and crimped terminals Unfortunately when it entered mass production the supplier Astron likely skimped on the QC and they didn't bother to check if the mass produced adapters were as good in quality The 3090 Ti 12VHPWR is far superior in quality than the 4090 one as it uses crimped terminals which is why we didn't hear any cases on it
Thermal fuse in the connector s
I wasn't talking about more than two sens pins I said plugs in PCIe power plugs
Got 2 1 was so stiff took me 20 mins to bend at 30mm 2nd came with loose terminals they say don't use them because holy fuck are the wires stiff And there's more pictures of them being super stiff and the terminals being loose My second one is literally so bad not even a cm of bend I can see the pin in the connector drop down the connector Good luck
Nope cuz it has a timer waiting to melt so better safe than sorry face with diagonal mouth
Wow Appreciate your response I don t want to check mine but I guess I have to now I also got a new Corsair 600W cable Debating whether I should just go ahead and switch to that or stay with the default adapter Decisions decisions Edit So far I ve gamed 15 hours Uncharted 4 and also did extensive stress test 3DMark StresTest along with running every benchmark app out there No issues with default adapter so just scared to even check lol
PSU make
You're holding it wrong was a bad idea for the iphone 4's bad antenna design This is worse because of fire
It's illegal to deny warranty this way and they're likely being advised by Nvidia's legal team to say this There's serious shenanigans when illegal actions are done as standard CYA protocol
Thing is Corsair's HX1200i is ATX 3 0 certified and their 12VHPWR cable is sold directly from them If they won't accept that then what's the point of ATX 3 0 Fair point but manufacturers dont guarantee use of their cards with cables they havent tested themselves Its odd that this issue with the adapter now wasnt noticed in the week a lot of reviewers had their 4090 cards and were tesing them Its most likely far rarer than most make it out to be Could also be that a lot of them didnt use cases and hence had little bending on the adapter Lets assume a 100 cases so far thats assuming only 10 of the cases ended up being posted here Lets say Nvidia atleast sold 30 000 4090s so far Thats less than 1 and those are odds i can live with They aren't allowed to deny them for arbitrary reasons though And in the US at least the tie in clause of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act forbids a company from making a warranty conditional upon using their accessories unless they can prove they're necessary to function It's a very important clause otherwise you could say be denied a warranty on your car for getting new tires Or say Asus could deny you a GPU RMA because you used a Gigabyte Motherboard Which would be horrible So no they're not allowed to deny you a warranty for this reason This said even if they are breaking the law and they if they deny you a warranty for say using Corsairs native 12VHPWR cable you'd still have to take them to court for the law to be enforced And I totally understand wanting to avoid that Its not arbitrary If they havent tested those cables then its fine for them to deny warranty due to damage from the use of 'unsupported cables' When manufacturers ship out cables along with the product its clear they intend you to use them with the supplied cables Id expect AIBs to update their warranty policy for the 4090 soon due to the issues we have now but until that time iam using the native one x200B Normally I agree and I respect your decision to handle it that If this weren't a potential fire hazard I'd absolutely not use an alternative cable adapter But like if my house burns down I don't their going to reimburse me for my roommates dead dog How could they Your house isnt going to burn down lets not be dramatic At worst youre going to see smoke smell burning plastic at which point youd probably shut off your pc
Here's a neat rule of thumb When people start flexing like a spelling bee champion the conversation is typically a lost cause Lack of response is a response Watch this
No problem I just don't want fear to spread unnecessarily to devices that are safe If these were problematic we'd have heard stories like this for the past 2 years But they're fine I'm sure there's probably at least one example out there of a failure but that doesn't on its own indicate a problem since a failure can just as easily be caused by mishandling What we're seeing here is different however Nvidia needs to get ahead of this before it gets any worse
I'm very tempted to just replace the soldered connectors with crimped ones I have all the tools and probably the correct terminals
I don't care about downvotes We're talking about risk There are hundreds of people who leave their computer to render and go to sleep This is not an acceptable risk Many people using this card are unaware of the situation even if you are aware of the problem this card should not be sold as such here's the truth It doesn't matter which part of the card can be starts a fire You can't simply say it's a cable problem all fine blabla It's not fine fire risk here I think people who downvote that fast are strict fanboys they do not have enough knowledge or they are ignorant it cannot be explained in any other way You wouldn't defend a product that poses a fire risk but they do replace the cable and all is well no it's not
No problem Sorry if I wasn t clear enough I ve been getting triggered reading some of these threads because the anti Nvidia concern trolls are out in fucking force
Well no I'm not sure Power supply manufacturers sometimes like to do different things but I am decently confident From what I read Type3 vs Type4 corsair are the same for everything except the 24pin which has extra Vsense wires As far as I know the 8pin ports on corsair modular CPUs are agnostic to whether a CPU or GPU cable is plugged into them thus they can all support 300W which is why corsair is confident making this cable If you have a corsair PSU and it has enough 8pin slots to accommodate the connector then I have high confidence that it will work This is nothing like the Nvidia adaptor The Nvidia one needed to follow the 6 2 pin spec which is only rated at 150W and needs 4 of them for 600W You can't evenly distribute cables from 4 connectors onto 6 pins which is why the wires are not directly crimped into the housing and you got that soldered bus bar mess that's causing all these issues They even say If your CORSAIR PSU can handle the power requirements of the PCIe 5 0 GPU all you need is a cable that does as well on their website
Hard to tell from that picture but it does appear like a design of the 4090 one but a different variation with only 3x 8 pins I'd pull back the sleeving on the cables between the 8 pin and 12 4 pin connector if it's just 2 thick wires between the connectors I'd be cautious about using it if it has 6 smaller cables then I'd be more relaxed since that would make it very similar if not identical to the 3090Ti adapter that hasn't had any issues
I can agree on that I can also understand why they are reluctant to put out that kind of statement I have a PNY 4090 coming in next week and I will simply return it if Nvidia says you should not use the adapter because it's not worth it to me to keep it as a paperweight until they solve the issue Especially with AMD announcing their new GPUs next week
One burnt one was from a guy that was undervolting so I wouldn t be confident that even that s safe
They can't put out a statement without investigation they need to research it themselves without getting random people on the internet claim stuff It's a legit issues but if they say it's not safe to use they're legally liable for damages other way around as well But it's power limit the card if I were you Make sure it can't draw too much power because that'll heat it up
The 30 cycle thing is not a thing
It seems like if the issue is caused by stress fractures of the metal in the adapter pulling it out repeatedly to check on it would greatly increase the chances you damage it If it was me on my card i'd probably just use a different old card until a i could get a better adapter
Given the amount of information and incidents I wouldn't wait for Nvidia to say if these adapters are safe or not Some of them obviously aren't I'm sure more failures will show up weeks and months from now So far the initial signs point towards the Nvidia adapter I'm more curious to see what Nvidia finds out and how transparent they will be with their findings
People may say otherwise and be in denial but regardless of what you do in ur computer I don t think you should risk itthinking face but it s up to u
most cases closed cause the wire to press or slight bend against glass so I would remove the side panel it needs 35mm clearance according to NVidia before the bend starts and the vast majority of cases can't accommodate that I'd also order the 90 degree adapter from cable mod
Connect only 3 of the 8 pins and set your power limit to like the minimum and you should be fine Still no guarantee though It would be better to use a different cable outright
Why are you stressing when you knowingly agreed to be a beta tester It was very clear in the EULA that you read and agreed to when installing their drivers to use the card
They can't won't issue a statement because they don't know They are just starting to investigate this and it will take weeks for them to check everything they need to look at
No company will issue a statement particularly about the safety before they have investigated If for no other reason than liability
Just smell it during GPU running no need to unplug it you will definitely smell is something is burning
u got a 4090 for movies and productivity tasks
Bro if you have a 4090 just use it Do your due diligence and make sure that the connector is not bending to the side and make sure it doesn t have a lot of pressure on it from any weird angle and make sure it s fully connected But other than that not gaming on your new gpu and living in fear is not the move There s been probably in the realm of 50 000 or more 4090s sold already and the issues are below 20 at this point Don t get me wrong it s very serious issue that needs to be investigated and nvidia needs to get to the bottom of it but the chances of it happening to you or me are very small especially if you don t have any sharp bends or angles in your cable I ve been playing with my 4090 nearly nonstop since getting it a week ago playing uncharted maxed out 4K as well as the new cod maxed out and I ve done a bunch of over clocking and benchmarking attempting to get back onto the 3D mark HoF Am I concerned about this adapter Yeah I think it s a stupid design that has a uniquely low barrier for issues but am I personally concerned about mine Almost completely not I think if it makes you feel better when you power down your system after gaming or work or whatever you use your gpu for it doesn t hurt doing an inspection of the adapter I ve done it a couple times myself
Are you talking about production quality control or design validation because they are two distinctive things the latter was clearly done and there are confirmation but the quality control is not handled by then and they check just a samples not each single one
It could be just a different vendor's standard part that is more robust if the only issue is the connector
You expect us to believe they know and release it anyway c'mon lets not loose our mind not a single company would take such decision There are more likely and probables explanations like difference from preproduction to production quality by the supplier to begin with
It's not like each card is being tested for hours which is what it takes to burn these cables apparently I can believe that Nvidia didn't know because it would literally be fucking stupid to release a broken card as your flagship No one wants recalls
Pcie can hold 330W palax aib posted a video using the adapter pushing 1200W before it melted this is not that issue
I'm saying with 2 sense wires it can pull 600W I overclocked with 2 sense pins lol connector perfectly fine cuz it wasn't nvidias cable
I m pulling the plug
I was also afraid to check but I m glad I did Right now the adapter is damaged but the card doesn t show any sign of damage at all Looks like I got out ahead of it thankfully
Schrodingers Cable The cable can be thought to be melted or not melted until you take a look which will affect the outcome
If you have the Corsair cable why would you not be using it most of us are still trying to get them lol
you have the solution to the problem at home but u wont bother checking and rather wait till your card actually gets damaged plz remove the adapter and use the corsair cable
Fair point but manufacturers dont guarantee use of their cards with cables they havent tested themselves By this logic Asus could deny your warranty on a 6900 XT because you used a Corsair power supply with 8pin cables because they haven't personally tested them Its not arbitrary If they havent tested those cables then its fine for them to deny warranty due to damage from the use of 'unsupported cables' When manufacturers ship out cables along with the product its clear they intend you to use them with the supplied cables It's literally not okay for them for to deny warranty in this case That's why I quoted the tie in clause It's literally against the law The onus is on them to prove their device needs their accessories to work Otherwise like I said you could void your cars warranty by getting new tires Id expect AIBs to update their warranty policy for the 4090 soon due to the issues we have now but until that time iam using the native one That's fair I respect your decision Your house isnt going to burn down lets not be dramatic At worst youre going to see smoke smell burning plastic at which point youd probably shut off your pc Electrical fires are not easy to put out If you don't catch it early enough it could catch fire I'm not saying this is the most likely scenario but it is a possibility
Legendarywristcel I have been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty
A neat rule of thumb for me is when people try to use a phrase they think sounds smart but then fuck up simple spelling I assume they're probably ignorant in other ways Especially if they get upset when being corrected so I appreciate you confirming that When you honestly believe the CEO of a multi billion dollar company is even tangentially aware of decisions being made about a power adapter there's no conversation to be had so I also appreciate you not responding further
Hmm if only there was a way to test it you'd could make a shit load of money selling those lol Maybe try it A 1600 dollar test dummy is hard to try even tho I understand crimping and your prolly not risking anything as long as you don't use the double separated terminals Nvidia adapter terminals have a separation on the top and bottom while all other adapter and pcie gen 5 only have a separation on the top
Same No worries I have an FE nervously monitoring if any FE's show up in the sub All good as of 10 15 to present
i have a seasonic psu btw the corsair cable is out of stock i'm now considering buying the cablemod version attribute pa color black attribute pa pci e cable 16 pin to 3 x 8 pin pcie that also divides in 3 8pin so no question asked if the 4090 will leave enough space to safely bend that i will order it on monday
I posted a better picture of the connector here
It's funny because I was trying to decide on a new GPU recently and everyone was insisting AMD was horrible because their driver updates are slower I'll take a slow update over a product being released with a known fire hazard It's impossible that it was missed during development and I believe EVGA dropped their entire GPU division rather than letting Nvidia make them release a dangerous product Nvidia better be hoping that no one at EVGA leaks because that would snowball into a major court case
You could get a third party cables from Cablemod Mine is coming on Monday and I plan on using up all my 30 cycles on the Nvidia adapter until then Will throw this in the trash where it belongs when I get the CM cable
Just buy an ATX 3 0 PSU If you can afford a 4090 you can afford a 200 PSU to use it worry free
I can personally say that one burnt adapter connector is fine supposedly was from someone playing Planet Coaster for 6 hours on a stream with Afterburner saying the card averaged 150W The post should go up once the pictures stream vod and any response from ASUS Nvidia about the damage is received if they are telling the truth of course
I feel like when someone's house burns down they are going to be liable for that too so they need to hurry it up And frankly given the severity of the issue it should probably be less of a request and more of an order from the government
Yep if it were me I'd return it It's pretty clear this will require either a complete recall at worst to replace with a new card and a new adaptor on the card or perhaps a driver firmware update to gimp power below a certain limit or at best a redesigned plug for every single card with this adapter If I were within my 30day return window mine would have already been returned until this is sorted I'm calling a driver firmware update to limit power draw until the whole thing can be sorted which is a good reason for people to return their cards it may force Nvidia to hurry a fix rather than sit on their hand to see how bad it will get before acting
My Cablemod native cable is arriving tomorrow or Monday I just need it to last until then What I do is I am not gaming on it and I place my finger on the fabric end of the connector when the PC is running and check if its hot
It's cheap cables and bad soldering
Surprisingly this is incorrect Most cases have happened when the cable wasn t bent It seems to happen no matter what
What if the card burns someone's house down in the mean time
No This is only until I get the CableMod cable
I'd argue the design validation was not done for their cable connector if it's such a prevalent issue Hell knowing how large their cards are they should have had more scrutiny
My answer is tailored to that comment there is no temperature load or power draw log stored on the card they need it to inspect what happened at the terminal coupling
YES It only has two sens wires With three cables 450W with four 600W with two or one cable it won't boot due to the sensing wires
folded hands
You are absolutely right I ll do it today and while I m at it will switch to Corsair cable Don t wanna take a chance when I plug the default adapter back in Thanks for your responses once again You have a good one
checked mine everything seems to be ok What model card you have and is it a OC model Mine is just a Non OC Asus Tuf Also have much game time you think you have put on the 4090
Exactly this Haha
Yes that s my assignment for today smiling face with smiling eyes Thanks
Some people have more dollars than sense
By this logic Asus could deny your warranty on a 6900 XT because you used a Corsair power supply with 8pin cables because they haven't personally tested them Not a fair comparison since Asus doesnt send you a PSU along with the card and ask you to only use that Iam not defending Nvidia's adapter but iam not going to risk voiding warranty Ofcourse you could always use a third party cable and tell them you used the Nvidia one but i suspect theyd ask for pictures to verify your claim
Tbh I'm not really looking to make money off this I just want to do it as a proof of concept to myself then post up the instructions for others to follow I wouldn't want to sell these anyway because if one were to mess up and burn a house down I couldn't afford that nor could I live with the fact I caused that damage in someone's life
I ve got a cable from ModDIY on order hopefully it comes quickly Will swap the adapter out ASAP Then when EVGA releases their new PSUs I might consider upgrading to one of those Either that or Seasonic I looked at my adapter once and all seemed good Plugged it back in and made sure I heard it click Just going to leave it be for now Enjoy your card
Good choice ALWAYS match the PSU manufacturer to the cable because there is no standard to follow for the PSU port Corsair one at best wouldn't fit and at worst break your shit Insta tripping short circuit protection if you're lucky You can't mix shit EVER unless you see your exact product on a compatibility list of some sorts Also check if you can get a free cable from seasonic Seasonic Prime 1300 Prime 1000 or Focus 1000 are eligible
That definitely looks like a new variant with only 3x 8pins but soldered connections So I would be wary of that one I wonder if aibs had the option to spec just a 3x 8pin adapter if they didn't want to have their cards have the ability to pull 600W
Afaik EVGA getting out of the business was more about slim profit margins than anything else
if you're an amd fanboy just say so
Amen I agree 100
Afaik CableMod has quite long list of orders to go thru atm so you can't just go and get them that easily considering for many this would be something they want to get ASAP
You could get a third party cables from Cablemod I would be furious if I paid for the best possible card Nvidia can make and had to spend still more money for something as basic as a cable
Could you ELI5 the 30 cycles bit I'm a novice regarding this
You should keep the cable incase it damages your GPU you ll want it for proof of cause just incase
So the 30 cycle thing is not the cause of the problem and
That would be a good idea if ATX 3 0 PSUs were actually readily available
That s such a Shit way of thinking Stop using a perfectly capable power supply and buy a brand new one All because the supplied adapter is faulty
you don't have a 4090 so your comment is irrelevant
From some of the videos it really just looks like a new adapter I don't think it'll be that big of a deal
That'll never happen The same people roped into buying these cards for 2k will not return it without shedding many tears and having the cards ripped from their prying hands
My cablemod burnt up to Not so sure what it is I have like a week till return period up If nvidia don't comment soon Gonna prolly skip this generation
Safest play is to recall everything card and adapter But that s expensive and a really bad PR look They would rather recall just the adapter but they need to verify that it is just the adapter at fault As for what if there s a fire in the mean time that s a business legal decision If they think it will cost them more to do a recall than settle a possible lawsuit they will just sit and wait for the testing to finish They also need to weigh the probability that this would lead to a full fledged house fire
makes more sense hope the cable goes ok for you good luck
They did as reported by people in the industry anyway did any of the FE adapter fail
Mine has 2 sense wires and 2 pcie 8pin connectors going right to PSU 600W overclock 3ghz increased voltage too no melty
Just out of pure laziness and neglect
Not a fair comparison since Asus doesnt send you a PSU along with the card and ask you to only use that Literally read the Tie In Clause of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act It's literally a law for this type of situation Also this would be exactly like a car manufacturer denying you a warranty because you changed your tires Or you didn't use their approved brand of oil Because cars do come with tires and oil in them But it's against the law for them to do this because of the Tie In Clause Now I understand not wanting to rely on that because you'd likely have to take them to court to get them to honor it But I'm the US we literally have a law that covers this exact situation Iam not defending Nvidia's adapter but iam not going to risk voiding warranty And I've told you numerous times I respect that decision Ofcourse you could always use a third party cable and tell them you used the Nvidia one but i suspect theyd ask for pictures to verify your claim Shouldn't be hard to fake pictures honestly
Oh I know I was more making a joke that a pretty simple skill could be useful in times like this I love that shit Reminds me back when I first learned how to make RJ 45s lol
unfortunately i have the 850w version but thanks for letting me know is there a page where i can actually buy this cable by seasonic
I have also seen them say they are also missing some brands this was the thread that I mistook context 3 like Corsair and things like that Great for people who can get them and iirc that thread they mentioned they'd look into expanding support for that stuff
Yup it seems like there is a month long wait for the cable to ship from cable mod I was going to order one until I saw the shipping date
right Makes no sense that now I need to go get a 30 cable to a card that cost me over 1600
It was a wild misunderstanding based off some copy on the Zotac website that people are now treating as scientific fact
One early worry with the new 12HPWR connector was that specification calls for it to last at least 30 plugins and unplugs Later we found that all pc power connectors have that spec The problems with the connector are not because of this 30 spec
Basically you cannot remove and reattach the 12VHPWR connector to the GPU more than 30 times as at that point the terminals become loose due to stress and lose contact This is in theory In practice the cable should last more than 30 removals
I keep checking the connector every 5 hours to see if it's melting This is only until I get my Cablemod native cable on Monday
There are three mainstream ones on the market you can order to ship instantly
Obviously Nvidia fucked up and you shouldn't have to buy a new PSU to use your card But if you want a 4090 bad enough to pay 1600 for it you probably want it bad enough to pay an extra 200 to use it without having to wait weeks to buy an adapter Or you can take a risk and buy one of these Chinese 450 W 12VHPWR to 3x8 pin that are in stock
The be quiet aftermarket adapter has two 12pin plugs for the PSU Not standard four 8 pin ones because it isn't a adapter it is a 12VHPWR power cable This is something completely different than what I was stalking about which is the standard nvidia adapter
Literally read the Tie In Clause of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act It's literally a law for this type of situation Also this would be exactly like a car manufacturer denying you a warranty because you changed your tires Or you didn't use their approved brand of oil Because cars do come with tires and oil in them But it's against the law for them to do this because of the Tie In Clause Now I understand not wanting to rely on that because you'd likely have to take them to court to get them to honor it But I'm the US we literally have a law that covers this exact situation I suppose it must be easier there where i live it'd be hard enough to get them to replace the card if i used the nvidia adapter Id probably will have to get in touch with MSI global to get it done
Melody Prisca I have been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty
Don't remind me about making rj 45s lol I was working with this one guy when I was in college wiring offices and setting up networks I can't even begin to count how many rj 45 connectors I
CableMod supports Corsair PSUs pretty well You might be thinking of some other brand
We support Corsair actually what were you looking at that you thought we were missing Happy to point you in the right direction
I have one of CableMod's 12VHPWR adapters running from a Corsair HX1200 to a 4090 FE No issues so far
They have Corsair I ordered one last night unless I ordered the wrong one which I hope isn t the case
Can confirm I ordered on the 29th of Sept Before the issues were identified and cards were released and it took until the 22nd to get my cable
Hi Apple is calling
People are loosing their mind
Ah understood Thanks
I wouldn't trust it at all if it really looks like this Especially not plugging it more than absolutely neccessary
Which ones and where can I buy them in the EU
Yeah nvidia just sucks ass corsair is 2 pcie 8 pin 600 if you have 1200W psu Palax the aib posted a video putting 1200W through that nvidia cable to make it hit 100c melting point so the power draw isn't the issue at all
Yeah consumer protection laws aren't the same every where unfortunately And companies services varies from region to region I heard people surprised Americans liked EVGA so much because where they lived the service was terrible Hopefully if something happens you aren't given too much trouble
Gamer Nexus is looking into two types of Nvidia connectors with different rated cables being used v EIKjZ1djp8c v EIKjZ1djp8c Need to have a look at mine as the cablemod cable is weeks away
My mistake I will edit the comment it was a thread from a day or two ago this one here context 3 which I misremembered My apologies Also thanks for all your work with the community 3
What PSU make model are you using Happy to confirm
Custom cables are longer wait by 2 weeks they said so that's why
yes it entirely depends on how you take care of your connector Like Igor said in his last video if you bend cables WHILE plugged in then the pins will move and loosen the female end which will result in worse contact which means more heat so if you are very brutal with your connectors they might not even reach the 30th
Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 TT Premium Gigabyte UD GM PG5 and MSI AG PCIE5 They are on Amazon and many other PC parts retailers have them too
You can also see if you can find something like this wmlspartner wlpa selectedSellerId 101082431 it's basically the 3090 TI adapter Only can do 450 W though
Just checked mine and made this post Here is the link with a pic of what to look for to confirm you have 300v cables in your utm source share utm medium web2x context 3 utm source share utm medium web2x context 3
Thanks I had a AX1200i Digital ATX but it died after one year of moderate use Corsair send a replacement but they didn t have the same make I am not the most handy so I brought it to a local mom pop to fix They took care of the RMA but Corsair sent an upgraded PSU as they didn t have the same model in stock I can t recall the exact model name but it has similar specs to the original The shop is closed over the weekend so I ll need to wait until tomorrow to reach out I m learning albeit slowly to do my own work on the PC I really admire all of the builds I ve seen folks put up on the subs I doubt I ll ever get to that point but I ll keep plugging away I really appreciate your offer to help
You can get priority assembly by paying a surcharge and that may speed up the process I did not because I figured it would work out with the launch timing and it did
I wonder if I can just unplug the PSU side of the cable and instead use the integrated graphics from CPU until the cablemod 90 degree cables are available
Thanks Apparently the GIGABYTE UD1000GM is only ATX 2 31 and that's basically the only one that I have been able to find in stock from anywhere in the EU that ships to my country from your list but only at one sketchy online shop that doesn't have the best reputation It's only the 1000W version although I'm looking for at least 1200W if not more I'm eying the Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 1650W which one German store seems to have one unit of in stock but they won't sell online
Oh nice I asked if I get the normal packaged wires if that'd be faster and Matt said yes so I just got that Wish me luck glad you timed your out well tho I for one am over it my connector is fine and I'll just wait at this point lol
Oh that's my bad on the Gigabyte At least it has the native 12VHPWR although there some bad user reviews on it
FYI samples are already in the hands of test labs and industry veterans for some testing
uuuuuu
Absolutely love y all s commitment This looks fantastic
Nice Looks really well made Looking forward to getting one
as you guys reached 100 upvotes here is the promised pictures we will be shipping as promised in February and the connector will be available in all kind of colors
The exposed contacts on these types of connectors always makes me nervous Especially with so much current running through this
I'm a bit out of the loop what exactly is this and why is it important
I ve got an amd card but still love your products and how you engage with the community and reply to comments 3 cablemod
Damn that s fucking dope Gj
i have a boner looking at this
Happy cake day cablemod
Thanks for posting will finally be able to close up my case
This shivers my timbers
Fuck me I'm so stupid i thought this was an OBD and was confused as shit Good on you guys for making a 90 degree
You had my curiosity now you have my attention It would be really nice for my ITX build
Probably already suggested somewhere at some point but I wonder if having a little bit of bright white coloured paint or dye on the pin portion of the cablemod connector that goes into the socket of the gpu would help with providing visible feedback to the user if they're fully socketed Fully seated no colour would be visible
Not a fan of exposed soldering
What do the temps on the connector look like
Maaaaaan you guys have had and always will have my business Always making our PCs look and now operate better Thank you
S E G G S Y I am hurling money at my screen yet nothing appears HOW DO I ACQUIRE
So how do you pull that one out if the clip is on the bottom
Looking real good PCB looks nice and sturdy as well Hopefully I can get my hands on one or two to clean up my builds
What is it
Happy cake day CableMod
Remember
Oh man that s sick I would be able to hide the cable now on my vertical mount glorious
Once this is available ill be getting a full custom kit from you guys Good to see the engagement on reddit and gives me faith in a good product
I m really curious if this would fit in my Cerberus C with my FE I ll be grabbing one to try on release
Looking sweet Love you guys for doing this kind of stuff for the community
I've been using the angled adapters forever since it looks much cleaner glad these are coming out for the 40 series even though I don't have one yet
Looks nice I'd get one 3 Thank you guys you're cool
Finally a wireless power adapter
My p400a 4080 build thanks you for your service
Can't wait for my pc to look clean af love you guys purple heart
Can t wait to get this when it launches I ve been windowless for a few months now because of bendgate Keep up the good work
So us peasants with 30 series cards need not worry about this pleading face
A beauty she is mate
FANTASTIC
Can t believe y all have to make these Nvidia should be ashamed considering the price they charge Thanks for dealing with the community and engineering solutions
I'll be looking forward to the 180 one for vertical mounting
This looks like a great product solution Shame that the community had to solve an issue that never should have left the drawing board but here we are If I ever get a 12pin GPU I'll definitely pick one up
Neat Gonna wait until this arrives at the store then
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Better not combine 4 together for infinite power
Looks like a high quality product on mailing list and will buy
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I didn't ask
Was looking for these today with no results Nice to see this Will I be able to get one in the EU Denmark
Yay I love me some cable organization products
On your cake day no less
Looks sick
I have s 6 2 pin for use with common psus Also make a straight 12vhppwr x 12vhpwr for native connections to newer psus Remove as many breaks in the wires as possible Thanks and good work so far I will be using your company's products for 4080 so as I get it grinning squinting face
I want one of these for my 3080ti
Love CableMod AND you have fingers Total package alert On another note thank you for all the work waiting on ordering a 4090 so I can get your cables with it
If the 4000 series ever come down to a reasonable price I'll definitely pick one up
Oh man I need that so bad Did you guys deliver to Japan
Oh hell yes
When does international shipping start for these things Been looking at getting one of these out in Australia
What angle should I buy for a vertical GPU
This is good news my 4090 needs this Will they be available for the UK
I'm sorry this shouldn't be a thing You don't need a 50 cablmod adapter you need to plug it in all the way
You guys are gonna make a fortune on these and you know what You deserve it There's no doubt there are gonna eventually be cheap knockoffs but on something that handles 600w you gotta get the real deal I don't know if you are able to patent your designs but please have your legal team stay vigilant on shutting down the copycats
Can't wait
Is this the B variant
Will be grabbing one for my 4080 here in Australia Be nice to put the side panel back on my PC
Hello I have an important design question Since the tab that clicks and locks into the female end is under how will we be able to remove the adapter if needed
Are you able to give an idea on pricing
I'm wondering if this will be enough for me to get my case lid back on
How long until the A B variant of the 180 adapter are available in Canada Bought my first set of 2 0 sleeved cables from you last week A 12VHPWR to 4xPCIe and a 24 pin Eagerly awaiting them As soon as the 180 adapter is ready I'll be grabbing one too Happy cake day btw
what kind of price are you guys looking at
can you plug it to itself make to make 180 degree lol
Is this just an adapter or whole cable
I ordered multiple cables to Hong Kong in the don't ship to China Breaking the hearts of Hong K
Still no update on MSI Cards I Only the Suprim Liquid is checked off Losing hope that my Gaming Trio will be compatible with any of the variants
Will you still be adding GPUs to the compatibility list I have a MSI Gaming Trio and the only MSI card on the list is the Suprim Liquid X
Any plans for cables with 90 degree plugs
Shut up and take my money face with tears of joy
I am fully erect now
Looks good Can you provide a link for pre orders
Very nice
Been looking to upgrade and with this it'll be much cleaner look What's the price if I can ask
Can anyone tell me if I m getting the right Cablemod adapter It looks like the 90 adapter B would be the right one GPU is gigabyte 4090 windforce and is installed the standard way Thanks Here s a picture of my GPU
I need this desperately Sincerely the 12VHPWR cable smooched up against the side panel on my O11D Evo grinning face with sweat
What is it
Is this going to be a viable via Amazon
Will the MSI GAMING TRIO RTX 4090 be compatible I did not see it in the compatibility list I am wondering if this turns out to be a universal adapter
Happy cake day
Will wait for some reviews and measurements 50C 60C temps at load seems a little warm to me for a connector what kind of resistance powerloss are we looking at here
Is there an existing version of this for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Founder s Edition
will it melt
Happy cake day
I need this I don t have my side panel on to fit my card XD
Seeing stuff like this is the reason I'll buy from you guys Gonna need a set of black and blue cables to go in my Acer Predator G7200 sort of sleeper case soon so expect an order when I get around to measuring
So will this be compatible with the 4090 Suprim X I don t see it mentioned on the list
i live in a small island in the EU so most of my purchases come from computeruniverse or amazon germany will they have this or the 180 degree adapter stocked when the time comes
Any chance this will be compatible with a Colorful 4090 Vulcan OC
How can I order for Australia Please I will pre order if I can Thanks CableMod and your prompt responses oncoming fist
Finally
Is it actual copper
Guys I need it
r sffpc would like to know your location
is there a link were to buy this o
Happy cake day and this looks great
Happy cake day cable mod
Looks good
These are universal for most 4090 80 s Or do you have to buy a variant for the non founder gpus
Is there a reason why no one is making a 12vhpwr plug that splits right back into 2 or 3 pci power connectors To me in a sleeving sense it would look so much better
b b b but what happens if its not fully plugged in
I have an order waiting to be delivered from you guys for over 3 months placed it in October
Will it be available in europe
Do you guys plan on making any of these for 3000 Series cards Would love some for my 3080
looking good any word on eta so sick of seeing the hot mess in front of my gpu
Will this fit the 4080 also
Thank you CableMod My past experience with your products indicates the wait is well worth it I look forward to being able to buy one of these from you soon
I knew right away by the connector it's for the new plug but what is this exactly
how difficult is the connector to get out of the gpu
Probably cost 3k
I'm looking forward to purchasing one of these
I m new to this so sorry if this is a silly question Some of the vendors say that using third party adapters can will void your cards warranty So there is a risk of losing the warranty on an expensive GPU by using this adapter isn t there At the same time I suppose that unless it melts and fuses with the GPU it s impossible to prove you ve been using a third party adapter But in any case isn t that a concern
Exposed pins
u CableMod you are good people
Was hoping this would be the solution to the side panel on my case touching the cables and connector But this looks a bit bulky still Still might buy it tho P
Which one of these adapters would fit the MSI 4090 Suprim X I don't have the liquid version just the 3 fan version Super interested in getting one of these when they release Have the GPU in the Lian Li O11 Dynamic Evo and its a tight fit between the connector and the side panel
Is there a Philippine distributor or we will have to order direct
I noticed that the compatibility table doesn t mention the PNY 4090s will it fit with the PNY shrouds
Looks to me like wireless power adapter Who needs cables anymore
Yes but how much is it
Thank you for developing this and taking the time to make sure it has no problems
Pretty cool Just got myself an RTX 4080 that JUST BARELY fits into my mid sized ATX tower I see those cables bending even before I put the glass back on This would definitely help and make things cleaner too I am from India do you sell these here
Give it to me I NEEED it for my cablemod 12vhpwr cable that is badly squeezed in OMGINEEDIT
So these fit the MSI Suprim X Air model
Any new zealand stock
Is it strange I am hyped for this Does February timeline include the 180 adapter
Any idea when it s releasing
Omg thank you This is what we need
Will any of these angled adapters work with MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio
Why is it silver They done fuked it up
Would you guys be at liberty of sharing some specifications I'm specifically interested in the length end to end on the connector going into the gpu side
There ya go If only nvidia weren t a bunch of jerkjobs
Am deefo getting none for my rtx 4090 suprim to be on the safe side
Forgive my ignorance but what am I looking at here
Real copper contacts is a win for high power use products now I wait for gold plated contacts guys
Maybe edit your original post and include a link to your company's website thanks
Classy af
This is fucking awesome does it fit a 3080
I like your box dude
Question Why not make one with the 12 pin on the card side and 4x8 pins on the other in the same shape
It's a new product is there any warranty or guarantees on it on the off chance it damages hardware Keeping an eye on it
How can we get some to help test and try em out
What is it What have I missed Adaptor to avoid fires in the rtx 40 series
Maybe off topic cablemod but how can I get my hands on them while in The Netherlands Good job btw
dope send now
got any LED to indicate it is properly plug fully into the socket
Really neat I want one
This is going to work with the PNY 4090 cybertank Can I use the 90 one to connect the cable from above
BrUh I hErd DaT wiLL gEt U mOr FrAmEs In FoRtNiTe 1 Seriously though I'm buying it day one Thanks Cablemod person
This is amazing I can't wait to get my hands on one Will they be able to be bought in Norway shipped to Norway Also thank you so much for being so active in the community
This is dope While I wait what is the 12VHPWR Cable compatible with FSP Hydro PTM Pro 1200W 80 Plus Platinum Send me via Amazon
With the hook where it is it is the best way to not see if it s locked in correctly
Can t wait for it
Can't wait for the release
Will this be compatible with Gainward RTX 4090
Need meow
CableMod Matt does this work only with CableMod cable or CORSAIR 600W cable will also be fine
can someone explain to me what this is is this wireless graphic card or something
wireless power supply
Will this work on a gigabyte 4080 gaming oc I can t get the glass door on my dynamic Evo as the cables are in the way I think this would solve the issue
Ohhh yeeeahhhb
This thing is so hot they even put a heatsink on it but seriously looks cool
For those that will angle over the clip how do you reach it to be able to unplug one
Are we looking at the final product Aren't those soldering pins exposed in the bottom the power pins Doesn t that raise security concerns
Apologies I missed it I know this is still I Testing but do you have an expected release date
Will these also work on the 3090 Ti
First I need to know the price
Want this smiling face with heart eyessmiling face with heart eyes
I have the SilverStone 850W HELA 850R ATX 3 0 Gen5 and has native Nvidia 16 pin 450W single cable direct to my 4070 Ti SUPRIM X OC
What s the website
So is nobody going to say what it is Like what is it lol
heyy will this work on a gigabyte aero 4080
Feels like this shouldve always existed
Do you guys plan for an olde 8 pin too
What is it
Would love to see single double and triple 8 pin adapters personally since I know some cards are crazy power hungry cough cough asus
I hope to god that it s enough clearance to put the side panel back on my case loudly crying face
Thank you for actually participating in the community this was actually one of the reasons why I got your cable as it showed me you were confident enough to put yourself out in the Warzone that is pc Reddit and still be proud of your product handshake medium skin tone
Gamers Nexus igorslabs
TYSM This should have been done by the OEM but it's companies like you stepping up that makes PC gaming worthwhile
I didnt get one Lol jk would love one when it comes out
Can't wait
This looks real good but I've always been weary of third party cables Is it possible Gamers Nexus might be invited to review it
Can we see some more angles of the adapter Looks great just want to see what it ll look like on a card
ELI5
willing to test for Asus 4090 Tuf
Will be purchasing and recommending to my friends
Hello So about the 180 degree one concern i have is it seems to have multiple connections so more points of Or is the 180 degree using a single connection that smoothly transitions into bends Like example when you bend a solid wired psu connection Really concerned specially with a 2k gpu like the RTX 4090 Also this is taking really long to purchase any idea when in europe And does the regular 90 degree comes even in a thinner smaller model it might seem the 90 degree is still a bit
aaaaaa
Thank you
Thank quite happy how it turned out
As I was the one who voted the 1k upvote here can I have a free one thinking face Nevermind I only have a GTX 970 face with tears of joy
I filled out the preorder email list form on the website but haven t heard anything Are there any guesses as to when or how I ll be able to order this
posted guys asked for a preview here it is
Will they eventually be on Amazon
How will we in Europe be able to get these goodies
Will this be available on Amazon Germany or Caseking
Bet every AIB is going to copy this put RGB on and charge double the price They will also mention military grade components grinning face with sweat
dont worry it wont be an issue
Why
This is a 12VHPWR angled adapter We'll offer them in 90 and 180 degree flavors
As CableMod said it's a 90 adaptor for the new power adaptor introduced with Nvidia's 40 series cards and part of the PCIe 5 power spec You may have heard of all the people complaining about melting their plugs or being unable to nicely jam in their cables in their case because the cards are so wide these days This product aims to hopefully solve that issue The melting plugs is believed to be caused by not fully seating the plug which can possibly be worsened by trying to wedge your cables into your case
Thank you
Make sure to plug it in all the way
Thank you
Happy cake day to you as well
That s the whole purpose of this adapter
Same actually
nice for ITX we have 180 degree ones coming too width 1458 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 877f2b2ba2319cbe6348897728720fc7c8c05348
Great feedback will tell the guys thank you
it wont be an issue
Don't worry Asus will surely release one with a backplate for 99
between 50 60C on full 100 load
Thank you for the kind words and great support
in 2 3 weeks you can buy it
We will provide a manual for that
We will ensure a great availability
It looks like an adapter for the power plugs on GPUs That way instead of putting undue stress on the board the adapter plugs in nicely and then your power is plugged in from the bottom
Thanks
indeed
Thank you we are here to help and own it if something goes wrong
Let us know if it worked if not then we will refund you
We thank you for your support
we hope to fix your problem in January
Thank you
Thank you
February
Global power crisis solved
Thanks
Many guys did
for sure we will allocate a decent amount to our European customers wont be an issue
Oh and will this work with my 4070TI
So do we D
Indeed
Thanks
Thanks for the suggestions we will discuss
Thanks for your feedback Regarding native 12VHPWR to 12VHPWR cables we already have those
Working on it
Thanks for your post you made me laugh
Thanks
cmon we do not post that often
Yes we ship worldwide
Right at launch day we ship them to Australia already directly to you
It was noted above prior that PCCG will be stocking them
Depends do you have a pic of the build
Will be available globally from our store and from OCUK
You do need it if the card with the cable plugged in doesn't fit in your case we still highly recommend to have at least 30 35mm of clearance even if plugging it in properly is the most important aspect Alternative is spending 3 4 times more to get a new case Also it won't be 50
Thank you we are very well aware that very soon there will be copy cats but if people want to risk the well being of their 1500 2000USD to save 10 15USD then there is not much we can do about it
Likewise
Yes
nice PCCG will have inventory and we will be shipping directly as well
we will provide a manual for that
We'll share that info ASAP likely in the next 2 weeks or so here
how much clearance do you have
If you have very limited clearance keep in mind that the 180 degree adapter has a lower profile than the 90
right from the start you can order directly from us and we ship to Canada directly shipping will be just 7USD
currently it looks like that the aluminum shell version will go for 39 90USD 5USD in shipping
no need we have 180 degree ones coming too width 1458 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 5a748825740278946661aa677bbfed8abafc981a
Just an adapter yep Will be in 90 degree and 180 degree flavors
Adapter
sorry about that
We are checking about this right now it might work now because we modified it
We will add a bunch of MSI cards shortly
Not at the moment
Gladly D
Sorry about that
We will open orders shortly
Glad you like it
The aluminum shell version for 39 90 5USD for shipping
send a message to matt
Help is near hold the fort
They will be but weeks after our launch because we fulfill direct customer orders first
we will expand the MSI compatibility list in the next few days
the aluminum shell version will cost 39 90 5USD shipping cool
Check the comments here posted a few pics already of them
Thanks
That s what they are for
Sounds great thanks for your support
It will be Updating the compatibility list soon
hey hey can you reach out to our support team They will gladly assist you
They will have stock but not right at launch probably 4 weeks after launch
as soon as the orders are open we will make another post here
Indeed
The shell is aluminum but inside of it we use some copper
We are everywhere location world D
Not yet but soon
Not yet but you can stay up to date and subscribe to the mailing list here
Thanks
Thank you
You can check the confirmed compatibilities here the list is getting updates every time we manage to confirm other models but so far those are the ones
Not sure what you mean Our 12VHPWR split into 2 3 4 8pin connectors at the back of the case
b b b boom
Yes
Not really planned at the moment but we'll see since there's been some demand for them
Will ship by the end of February orders of course will open prior to then
Thanks for the support 3
It's an angled adapter which allows you to eliminate the initial bend of the cable coming out of the GPU
Thank you

We haven't verified compatibility with the aircooled Suprim X yet unfortunately we hope to get it sorted asap since it's a popular one
We have no local distributor in PH but you can order direct from us
we do D
The aluminum shell version will be 39 90 5USD for shipping
Yessir we ship internationally from our Global Store
Thanks for your support
We're still trying to verify that one
You can order directly from us it will just be 5usd in shipping
Yup all coming out together
February
looks like it we will revise the compatibility list in the next days
We will offer it in all kind of colors
Thanks
40 Series for now we work on units for the 30 Series as well
Not the first time we've heard that
February
That would create a very bulky adapter
our products always come with warranty
What do you mean
Adapters won't avoid fires They will also suffer from the same problem if people don't plug in connectors ALL the way which is what was causing the issue to begin with A very very small number of users apparently couldn't figure out how to completely plug in a cable
Angled adapter in the 90 and 180 degree variety
Caseking will have them and we also ship directly from our shops to NL
soon
nope
Seriously this is getting ridiculous If you can't look at a connector and see it's fully inserted perhaps avoid it all together
soon
We didn't confirm compatibility with that one but judging from the photos I think it should fit
420
Sure we ship internationally from our Global Store
FSP is sadly not a brand that is in demand for our customer base which is why we do not have cables for it on Amazon sorry
nothing we can do about it it gets defined by the plug on the GPU
likewise
likewise
it will work with any cable not just cablemod
tbh we picked the aluminum shell because of its cooling capabilities it acts as a heat sink to some degree
It s a prototype there will be a protection film covering those pins at the final product
February
yes
yes working on it
Working on that too
How much clearance do you have
Thank you it is tough at times because there are some real angry people on Reddit but we wont give up
Cheap PR lol people fall for it
90 degree adapter
They will be
We will share more pictures real soon
who is that
Thank you
That's it now I have you Will this ship to the UK Asking for a friend
r AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Is there any interest in doing something similar for the traditional 8 pin connections The 90 just looks so clean
And Happy Cake day lol
4 6 weeks
good one D
We will open orders in 2 3 week probably
They will be but probably 4 6 weeks after the launch because we fulfill the direct order first and ship directly to customers
from our EU Store or Caseking which store do you usually buy from
Yes to all
That s fine these days you always end up being copied
Do you mean that the exposed contacts have a clear non conductive coating on them
Some Nvidia engineer So we're worried that some people might be too clueless to plug in the connector all the way Some Nvidia Exec dont worry it won't be an issue Never underestimate the carelessness and ineptness of your average consumer There's always that 0 05 that'll manage to show you just that
Until it is
Could probably also make a little plastic backplate for it no If not everyone could theoretically 3D Print one though so just an idea
Will there be an RGB option with a CableMod logo I am planning on buying one and want to advertise your brand with LED swagger
i ve been mentally physically and sexually preparing myself for the release of this adapter for far too long
LOL

The last piece I m waiting on for my dual system dual 4090 build Wouldn t have been possible without you guys making these 180s so thank you
This has all 4 sense wires connected I know they re not really used yet but I don t want to buy something that will be e waste in a couple years because of 2 tiny pins Thanks
It won't have them in the final product or it won't cause any problems
Damn how about a waterblock for these things
Can you define 100 load on the 4090 that varies Are we talking stock 450W 100 load or 133 power limit 600W 100 load
Ohhh happy cake day My 12v to 3 8pin cable should be in this week Excited I even ordered the 4 8pin I wanna incase I upgrade to a 4090 lol
I am holding you responsible if there is a man on the news who has chewed off his fingers due to overly enthusiastic nail biting in anticipation
will work nicely
Hi Alex sorry to hijack your comment thread here with another user I'm just wondering if you offer anything like the product in the post but for the 30 series of rtx cards I've searched the comments to find no one asking similar unless I'm blind and just missed it I'd love to get something like it for my 3080 instead of seeing all the cables running over the top of the card
Noice If you want sum testers Hit me up I got a stunted 3080ti that can sip about 500 watts if i load my benchmark profiles up I got some decent experience with monitoring and logging environment and component health during intense instances
Awesome Will be waiting for it excitedly keep up the amazing work guys
Curious about the dimensions can we get that info please
They will indeed

Thank you Looking forward to finally close my PC case again beating heart
thank you also please be kinda on postage hee to australia is a killer when only ordering a small item
Not very much and probably not enough for this either but I'm willing to cut a small hole for this shape in the lid it's a cheap ass rosewell 4U bare chassis and I have a few of them so very little harm I think a nice little hole with grommets for this would be better than one with a big wire sticking up and going back in lol Hopefully the testers have positive feedback and there's no fire risk here I'll be in for one
Tight thanks
Not your
Thank you for the update Really like your products ordered a keyboard custom cable and it looks great
Thanks will definitely order then when I upgrade Thanks for being so involved in the community
Nice Will definitely be getting one
Sorry I didn't explaine it properly So right now you have a male 12vhpwr connector on a pcb board one one end with a female connector on the other I'm saying why not have 2 or 3 pci connectors soldered on the back of the pcb board in stead In my head the pci connectors look much better for sleeving but I'm guessing it would look very bulky aswell
Ok this is it This is what I need
Thanks Glad to know Could you kindly provide a direct link
Thanks for your awesome products
Kk ty
Wow really didn't expect a reply Been wanting cablemod for a pretty long while but was too expensive to justify This has just pushed me over the edge
Holy shit I was actually joking and you guys responded immediately Impressive Love you guys red heart
Just a thought I could see it being easier and would remove the chance of issues from lower quality 4x or 3x adapters
I'm talking about the gpu not the adapters
Is there a way for us to get these cables Is that not what this is showing Cables going to a 90 degree instead of Being flat
Is that why it was happening lol I thought initially they were saying it was bad solder joints on the leeds
Superb I am looking forward to it Thank you very much
H just love throwing shade at the Fortnite crowd
Awesome Thanks 3
Oh Thanks Do you have 12VHPWR to 4 Female PCIE cables adaptors Like those come with GPUs now which are actually long enough so you can make the connection behind the Casing
Getting these for sure
Mad respect for you guys for facing the community in their natural habitat
It s the internet and unfortunately there will always be people who downvote no matter what or are negative for no justifiable reason The objective FACT is your doing the right thing as 99 of consumers want communication and transparency with companies you guys are fulfilling that so it s literally the best possible move man shrugging medium skin tone
Kudos man Same as the OP for me I actually bought a cable from you guys because ya'll answered my build questions over on buildapc If ya'll are out there helping people build to help advertising you guys are doing something right
Good job guys And real angry is a damn understatement Especially in this sub
What about for us with atx 3 0 psu's
Will be shipped worldwide Plan to buy a 4080 but fear that i will spend 2000 on a paperweight live in third world country and prices are bs
Can you make one that goes to the side Like an L towards the front of the pc
OverclockersUK will have inventory and we also ship direct to the UK
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
we are working on it at the moment
There are several solutions available ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details th 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details th 1 I've got two of these on my 3090

I realized I didn t check my spam folder so I ll re submit the form Can I ask you which variant I should order It looks like variant B of the 90 but I m not 100 sure picture of my gpu
Any update here been 20 days
Usually from Amazon Germany or sweden One more question how much space needed between socket and sidepanel of case
Correct

Nice thank you for the support
ooops we better hurry then
I appreciate you guys Thanks and happy cake day
Unfortunately no this is the first time we do something like this We've been considering bringing 8pin versions though we'll see in the future
we are in contact with the mods and ask usually for approval before posting something All we intend to do is to be close to the community to address their needs and the big part of the community seems to appreciate it I am sorry if it bothers you
You're an asshole dude rough to be you
Wahhhhhhhhhhh
Thanks where in Japan are you from Planning a trip to Osaka Tokyo by April
you can find those here
Keen Will be picking one up on release For horizontal mounting 4080 in an 011D I assume the 180 degree will be the way to go Maximize space between adapter and glass panel
If it fits between the GPU and the motherboard RAM CPU cooler I would suggest you the 180 A which goes towards the motherboard and hides everything really nicely Otherwise you can opt for the 90 A which routes towards the front
Very welcome we'll get them over to PCCG as well actually so you won't have to worry about that
Thanks we will ensure there is no fire hazard issue
Thanks
Nice thanks for the support which color did you go for
Thank you
Awesome
Thank you
Aaah okay got it but yeah there would be a ton going on inside such an adapter would end up being huge and probably not practical at all
Orders aren t open yet so there isn t a product page but here s the Global Store
nice let me know if I can help you with anything else
We have a timeline on our landing page as well if it helps make sure to do the email sign up as well
will suggest it to the guys
we replaced GPUs before when our cables damaged something
It is an 90 degree adapter that has to be used in addition to a cable
Yup It turned out that the people that had the burnt plug issue only had them plugged in half way and the pins never made good stable contact Gamer's Nexus was able to replicate the exact issue by plugging the cable in half way and they discovered there were some very tell tale signs when connector was halfway plugged in Nvidia also stated at the time that they had received about 50 reports and at the time est 130 000 cards had be shipped So that makes it 1 20th of one percent and out of that 0 04 99 was user error That means 99 96 of 4090 users had no issues that number is probably up to 99 99 now considering how many more 4090s have been shipped out and the whole burning plug issue has practically disappeared Since this came out suddenly no one was reporting burnt connectors for a while Until recently a user posted that their connector melted and it turns out his connector had all the telltale signs of being plugged 't stop companies from taking advantage of it AMD used it to bolster their connectors and CM has been using it to sell aftermarket cables But the last incident involved a CM cable and just proves it doesn't matter if you use expensive fancy cables or adapters if you don't plug it in all the way it's gonna overheat and melt x200B width 1889 format png auto webp v enabled s 40f855d5cbc377cbeefed95be8c8f6c6d85c3f72
Thank you feels good to get this kind of feedback 3
What s the backstory here other than the previously known issues with the very occasional connector melting Something new happen
Thanks for the support
Wait you can use the same adapter
We will ship worldwide
That costs extra
Will it be available down under Asking for a friend me
What about the land of Sauerkraut Bratwurst and Bier Will it be available here too
Y all are the best Can t wait to see the final product s
I ll wait for the CableMod option to become available
yes on Amazon Canada and VLCanada
I'm not CableMod but you are correct Style B is what you'll need
For your GPU because of the cooler design you would want adapter A but this would be backplate side cable would be up and over the card instead of down and below the fans
I hope that ends up being clearly marked in the marketing material because that's a proper selling point right there
My first reaction is concern that it would be scraped by the metal radiator that's right where it's getting plugged into or the invisible coating get damaged some other way I can't see and short circuit to the radiator I'm sure you have a reason for doing it this way but the visual does not instill confidence Can you possibly enlighten me as to why you would do this as opposed to something like the 90 degree moddiy extension cable which doesn't have any 'exposed' metal I'm looking for a safe reliable solution and my hope towards your product is feeling tested by the visual What kind of guarantee comes with this thing
Maybe just stop crashing into things lol
happy b day cable mod
Bummer I was going to use this to help me connect 15amp romex wire in a junction box to help cleanup extra electrical wiring in my basement winking face
person facepalming Sorry I just love RGB can t help it
i have no idea what this means but please take my upvote happy cake day
bless you
Das stimmt Freut mich das der Adapter gute Fortschritte macht

Thanks
I live in downtown Osaka Will you be doing some tourism since you will be around D
How much room do you have between the gpu and side panel
Thanks really looking forward to this product
White cable with a black mesh on the outside Gold aviator connector with white black accents and gold connectors Really matches my build
Excellent thanks You guys are truly one of the best vendors out there
Cool Or I mean a intro bundle that included a CableMod branded 4x1 cable
Do you plan to make both the 90 degree and 180 degree for the MSI RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio Because comparing your pics from your connectors it seems it wont fit since the PCB is slightly in the way ie the width must basically be exactly the same as on the stock connector can you confirm you have the connectors for the MSI RTX 4090 or are these I couldnt find me first comment regarding the multiple breaks in your 90 and especially the 180 degree ie more points of failure or are these one single smooth connections
And are they available for sale yet
Wow Mind blown Good info Thanks
There is demand for 90 degree connectors So they are creating supply It's how you make
does it connect to this I dont think you guys have an extension for this yet
It will be at PCCG and we also ship directly to you guys
Nat rlich caseking wird die Adapter auf Lager haben
What's the price range I understand not rushing this out to market but personally I've been tired of having my case open for about 2 1 2 months and competition has already released their version
But could B work because I prefer to keep my cables running as pictured below the card and into the lower section of the chassis Will it not work potentially because of side to side clearance Like it won t clear the long edge of the card
Thank you
We will point it out for sure
But I like going fast and doing flips Also I have a 20 pack of propellers I need to use
Thank you
Lol
mod the cablemod with a mod that gives you rgb
Nothing wrong with that
Thank you
Thank you
Wir auch D
I for one welcome knowing that if I need their product I KNOW I'll get support from them
Yes namba is my favorite area in Osaka D
Just realized I might be up a bit of a proverbial creek face with tears of joy 9mm clearance looks like I m vertical mounting Edit That s with the ASUS TUF 4080 The MSI Ventus offers 23mm clearance Edit2 Haven t picked up a 4x00 series yet Been trying to wrap my head around all the different power connectors and clearances and so forth
sounds like a good mix we are going into keycaps very soon too which keyboard are you using
Very welcome and thank you kindly
We will offer those
Our connector will be compatible with MSI will update the compatibility list shortly
February
Oooh so that s what this is That s actually pretty useful The power cables on my 4080 press up against the glass panel
I also came into the comments to find out what this was Apparently it's a 90 degree connector I don't see the need for this snark
You can plug the cable you ve shown into our right angled adapter
I love you
Oh heck yes thank you
Will it be available in North Korea
Nice
any time let me know if there is anything else I can do for you
39 90
i d think the b variant contacts the cooler in your case
That would be cool to see
Oh you've been before Awesome Mine too hahaha I live just a couple minutes away by walking from dotonbori namba I hope you enjoy the city next time you're around
I recently just purchased a Keychron Q2 I like it but wouldn't mind getting some keycaps from y'all to replace the esc space bar and enter keys
Can you tell us about the breaks in the connector Or is this a one piece wire s with 90 degree bends or are these breaks bends soldered Which means more points of
Do you guys have an extension for it instead the adapter I would like to have the extension in white
Kim promised to make a few available
Gru aus N rnberg
Hmmmm ok I think you re probably right I don t want to or think it s entirely feasible to run the cords above on the back plate side
cool if you ordered from us before then you will get a newsletter about it
I am not sure what you mean with breaks
Danke Gr e aus Hannover H tte nicht gedacht dass ihr um die Zeit noch auf Reddit antwortet P Zeit zu schlafen zumindest f r mich nacht
Oh I got the newsletter earlier today The premium ABS Laser keycaps one right
Sorry i mean the 90 or 180 degree connector you offer are the wires within it soldered together soldered breaks another point of failure OR are your connectors using a smooth ONE piece wiring Srry english is not my native language I hope you understand my question In other words does your connector not use any daisy chain method just one single piece of wiring If it does use a form of daisy chain method whether soldered or otherwise it is prone to more failure
Hi could you please give feedback on my comment bellow I do want your connector but i need to be informed regarding the bellow question i have see bellow comment as an update to your question what i mean about breaks
Gute Nacht
Yes we will also offer other ones for non rgb boards soon
Added to Megathread Per OP card and adapter has been RMA ed and replaced He received a new 4090 context 1
4090 FE o o Oh boy
Ironically 40 series cable melting will help Nvidia sell the remaining ampere stock
I got the 4090 from Best Buy last 10 19 22 I installed it in my Asus ROG Helios case without the side glass panel I made sure i wasnt bending the adapter and used 3 cables from my Asus ROG Thor 1200w PSU I was playing mostly Warzone for the next 7 days on off maybe about 2 3 hours each time 10 29 22 My screen went blank after about an hour of playing I tried restarting the PC multiple times and still could not get a picture I checked the GPU and the adapter and that s when I saw it I contacted NVIDIA right away sent my card and adapter to them and within 3 days I got a replacement 4090 I will not be using the new card until NVIDIA makes a statement about this issue
Is this the first FE card
So what is left here The elephant in the room is that the 4090 itself is just defective in some way But If Nvidia just gave him another card then perhaps they are confident it s not the card itself Who knows at this point Maybe we will know something by the end of this week especially as the 4080 release nears I think Nvidia would want to rule out something s before the 4080 releases
Ok confirmed now that all 4090 owners are fucked lol Next episode will be 3rd party cables melting cannot wait for that episode
Now all we're missing is a negative cablemod post to complete the misery deluge It's nuts that I'm checking this sub daily out of fear and not simple interest
Nvidia are getting dangerously close to really damaging their brand right now
Looks like EVGA took the right decision after all LOL
looks at my Aorus Master who has been flawless since a week after launch Baby stay with me
Where are all those it never happens on FE dumbasses now
Glad to see ppl are paying 2k to be beta testers
Oh crap Not feeling so safe anymore with my 4090 FE
Nvidia WarRaNTy VoiD uNlESs An ApProVed PLuG is UsEd
Oh oh no This is reportedly the first FE to have burned so this is not a good sign
Rut roh so much for the founders is immune to melting NVIDIA did some special sauce talk Its cuz FE is super low volume been saying this forever We will see more FE melts in the near future
So will the 4080 have the same risk using the same cord but with lower power draw
Laughing at the scalpers who picked these up and can t sell them
Seems like it s an nvidea issue after all What a shit show this launch has been They blame the user for bending the cable or not plugging it in all the way but is that really the issue I guess we will just have to wait for a statement
Can t wait till nvidia gives 4090 users free 4090ti upgrades
Wtf is Nvidia doing about this literally nothing
And there was
width 4032 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s 7c0276fc9b678891dacabd6d2e940fe0d34cc625 Glad I got my CableMod on Thursday But I ve had mine since launch and the adapter was perfectly fine Wish we knew what the actual reason for the melting was Wish Nvidia would say something
This will get worst if the 4090 is available to OEM brands like dell or system integrator Most people buy their pc pre builds won t or don t know how to open and check Who s know might burn down the entire PC case house
Inb4 Nvidia reduced performance to patch the issue
Is this like the first FE card now with this issue Lol damn Nvidia that recall looking more likely every passing day
Finally FE
Why are people still using them when this is happening
Y all still buying these huh
Amount of copium here is insane
gif giphy l0MYC0LajbaPoEADu
You will be waiting a long time if they haven't admitted fault by now when will they
Lol at the burning cash award
It just works
this sucks your the bad news everyones been waiting for
I don t think Nvidia is incompetent I believe the engineers are well aware of the root cause for this issue The thing is that because the un launch of the 408012GB they can t unlaunch the second model now The stock price and shareholders will not tolerate that
Are the industry leading mouths still saying you plugged it not fully in
Still its another nvidia adapter coming new cases known to public each day non of the 3rd party cable cable mod or be quiet etc Has come to light known by now Sure we do have 2 cases till now of atx 3 0 native 12hpwr connectors melted both from the same msi psu though could be related to that
At this point if I had 1600 I d get a 7900 XTX and an AM5 upgrade rather than giving Nvidia any money
I guess all of them will burn eventually I ll keep a fire extinguisher next to mine xD worst purchase ever Nvidia should recall every single one
Still no real word from Nvidia about it
Apparently you plugged it in wrong s
its a design failure
I ordered from moddi 600w 1x12pwr 3x8 pin connector and im not safe with 3x8 now Great im using almost a month original sesonic 12pwr 2x8 pin from prime platinum 1600 no issues how sesaonic 2x8 pin is okay and moddi 3x8pin is no good for strix 4090 now
Seriously Fuck me Just the day I sold my TUF and bought the FE because I thought that was a problem with the third parties only
Even if the price was ok this is the reason i wouldn't buy it
Fuk it I gave up on looking now I am just gonna stick with my 3090ti until this shit does not get resolved
Oof just picked up a 4090 FE but i paired it with an MSI MEG Ai1300w PCI5 PSU Wonder how i will fair lol
Be me happy that I unbelievably snatched a FE 4090 in Europe just today I open reddit I see this Life sucks
So many where is the FE doesn t burn crowd now posts Man chill out Some folks were likely making an assessment based off the evidence that we all had up until now that being no burned FE cards seemed to have been posted thus far Sure others were spouting that off as if they knew with confidence that FE cards will not burn which was a load of shit but what gives You get some satisfaction over calling people out and being glad that FE cards are unfortunately also prone to shitting the bed
To extrapolate on my previous comment The new connector is Nvidia's Note7 and could be their 737 max8 if they're not careful
I hope everyone that owns a 4090 is contacting Nvidia This isn't acceptable If I had one this would make me extremely paranoid I think I'd rather just have my money back
Damn that sucks Iv seen soooooo many of these posts Soo glad I waited Def buying amd
Another theory is quietly laid to rest
I told y'all it was only a matter of time No one is immune
This whole burning card debacle is making me feel better about buying a 3080 ti this week
I feel really bad for you guys Conversely I m really glad I decided to just get an Ampere
Here we go
If you're still buying a 4090 at this point that's on you
All those people who were touting the FE doesn t have this problem lol that aged like milk
Is that the 1st FE that ever burnt
I don't get why these connectors are melting I have a shunt modded 3090 FE that pulls 500 watts and I my 12 pin connector hasn't melted yet It's the same connector minus the sense pins right Safe to assume this is more of a 4000 series issue than a connector issue
Will that be covered by the warranty thinking face
I'm someone who hasn't done a ton of research on this aside from seeing posts like this is this issue the card itself or the adapter Or both
Oh that SUCKS
This isn't the first once I've seen either
rip
Glad I m still waiting with my 3090 FE Where s the official statement At this point I may just wait for the 4090Ti
Welp now no 4090 is safe
I've got mine in without the side panel as well I have a cablemod cable in house but i think I'll just stick with the og and wait for it to fail If nvidia gave me a defective product then they can pay for a new one Maybe i should go pickup ab amd backup card lol
Wait according to your post on the other thread you had only 3x 8 pin plugged in so it should have never exceeded the 450W correct And it still melted WTF That definitely sounds like a defective product cable adapter
thing is if you take a chance and buy they might replace it if it melts within a few days or weeks if it melts 3 4 years later probably nvidia AIB will tell you to pound sand if i buy an almost 2k item i want it to last a while and not worry lol
This changes Everything
RE RE RE RE RE RECAAAALLLL
No matter what side of the argument you're on sorry you have to deal with this Whoever owns a 4090
meanwhile Prices are rising I don't understand this world anymore
3x burning cash award LMAO
Yeah idk why people are buying this garbage let nvidia fix their shady ass adapter first not worth just setting 1200 or more on fire I hate to say the more people buy them the less Nvidia will care to fix it
I was lucky enough to bag a 3080FE here in I might just skip this generation of gpus
Only 3 cables used instead of 4 Were you gaming when you noticed it Any idea of the wattage levels when melt occurred I've currently got a 4090FE and have power limited it to 65 around 270 290w in games and has so far been fine after a few sessions of cod at 4k each day Also using the included adaptor with all 4 cables plugged in but side panel off until cablemod cable arrives
They need to recall all adaptors and fix this shit I'm having to turn my pc off at the mains because I'm shitting myself that I'll come home from work one day and my house will be a pile of ashes
Anotha one Dj Khaled
I have had my 4090 FE since launch and have not had this burned connector issue Its still scary though and hope NVIDIA does something about it soon with a recall on the cables replaced with a newer one that fixes this
Now realizing how insanely FOMO driven humans are starting a company is awesome right now
I m curious if the OP ever opened his new 4090 FE or did he return it now that Gamers Nexxus and NVIDIA made a statement
This is what happens when you put just the tip in
I m going to test a 3090Ti with an ATX 3 0 and 12VHPWR cable and see what happens no one seems to remember that the 3090Ti FE has 12 4 on the card BUT the adapter for some reason is only 12 pin to 3 x 8Pin was planning a SFF build with an ATX 3 PSU I wonder with the 4 sense pins in use engaged on a 3090Ti if there will be a possible issue we ll see I guess
Here's to hoping my CableMod cable comes soon
Well as a 4090 FE owner and one that has pointed out once or twice in a post that I have yet to see any of the melting issues with the FE cards I'll still be running my card at full max like I have since I've gotten it on Oct 15th I get the worries but damn it's great playing everything maxed out I have the exact same psu and used the adapter up till this week when I changed it out for the cablemod The adapter still looked mint If it melts it melts This is my gamble to take and I'm good with it Still sucks how people act when they read these posts It's one big circle jerk
Gee all these people buying 4090s are havin their shit melted That will never happen to me though buys 4090 shit melts shocked pikachu face Stop buyin this shit
Oh well how about
What PSU do you have Out of curiosity
Instead of fixing this issue they're just gonna start selling the 4090 bundled with a fire extinguisher
nice hahahaha
Another one Dj Khaled
These cards are just too risky not to mention insanely oversized and over priced I feel like we are at a point where we have to totally redesign computers from the ground up Cases are too limiting for GPU's maybe have gpu boxes that connect on the outside of computers and connects to external ports on the case and the GPU will have its own dedicated power supply
There s going to have to be a recall If a fix was easy nvidia would have announced it already This card is burning atx 3 0 psus Maybe we have reached the limit for gpu wattage without a whole new type of power connector
DO NOT BUY A 4090
iT DoEsNt HaPpEn tO tHe FE
Well F there goes all my hope that the FE were immune to this At least not a single Corsair cable had a problem so this is the last hope
I m actually glad this happened so people can t stop being stupid Fe doesn t burn
Guess it s a good thing I m waiting to install mine until I get my cable mod cable
gif giphy P7JmDW7IkB7TW
mmmmm nvidia quietly replacing all the burned 4090's at the same time they were and still doing their best to keep everyone quiet about it including this sub
Here come the FE s now Holy shit this is an embarrassing launch
My question is wtf is Nvidia doing when they complete an rma Like what exactly are they changing Just giving you another card that will inevitably burn up again
it is best to desolder the connector from the GPU solder some 2 5 or 4mm2 wires directly to the GPU cut connector and strip insulation from PSU wires and connect to the wires soldered to the GPU with the wago 221 connector The idea that the current will be divided evenly over many pins is utopian If one pin starts to fail all the others will overload and fail as well
Where is the FE isn t defective crowd now
So basically it's your own fault
Have we actually worked out geographic locations Like have we co firmed it's all Regions or just America
Hot plugged
Finally
Oh my god
Got mine on release day and touch wood been awesome since
iTs JuST AiB CaRdS
Ok this atx 3 0 spec is just dumb 600w is what this janky connector is rated at 600w with 12v gives 50amps 50 amps is freaking crazy for a connector this small Just Google or Amazon search 50 amp connector Look at the size of the monsters that show up Huge guage wire huge connectors This fire hazard adapter doesn't even pass the giggle test of wiring and connector standards This standard and nvidias decision to use it is criminally negligent
This is a known issue
This is why I won t buy a 4090 First year ever I have not upgraded
How are all of those cards not recalled with stop sales issued to retailers if they are all melting their connectors
Its your own fault for not inserting rhe 12vhpwr connector in properly OP s
Glad I jumped on the 3080ti for 700 I was offered What a shitshow
Sweet Jesus look down people He put a RIDICULOUS bend on the cable to close the case
Finally a FE so it's not not dodgy PCB headers I have a feeling it's not the plugging in either there are cases but bad QA with the pins and some making better contant than others
You guys are nuts still purchasing these use amd this issue will not be resolved
0 1 MY ASS
Hey dummies Stop putting fire hazards in your PC How many posts of melted cables do you need before you wake up Do you need someone to burn their home down
Ppl gotta stop using Nvidia s adaptor All these evidence but y all still plug it in Ok I haven t even put in mine yet still waiting on cablemod s cable to come in
face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
That's nice and trending I want to say no one should be plugging all 4 x 8pins Card should still boot with 3 I think it's as simple as the adapter has been split too many times at 4x and the current is too much No one from the 3000 FE series including me and the 3090Ti have any issues with the included adapter and or aftermarket adapter me too since it's launch Really think 3x is the max but I'm not too sure what's going on with the legit ATX 3 0 PSU burning issue Maybe those too are wired as if it was 4x inside the PSU box
i ve seen so many of these posts i had a dream my 3080ti burned up like this then i woke up and realized i m not a dumb dumb and didn t buy the 40 series
Im waiting for my be quite Adapter hopefully that will not cause any issue also I have my ekw water block coming and now I am kinda afraid to put it on in case it burns the connection
More and more convinced that the contact surfaces are too narrow for 600watt
I don't own a 4090 but knowing that your 4090 could melt would it make a difference by undervolting undrclocking the card to pull as little wattage as possible while this whole thing gets sorted out
Only a matter of time before a gov agency probably in EU will make an official inquiry forcing NV to respond if not already done confidentially Wonder if NV is erasing Emails that showed a problem which they determined was not a statistical factor prior to launch They should subpoena EVGA also to see if any issue was reported to NV and when nothing was going to be done EVGA decided to LEAVE Or are they going to wait until a house burns down or someone gets hurt Lack of response by NV is rotten for sure maybe criminal Negligent
Fuck I was letting mine run at 100 power target since it was only hitting 65c I am using the msi atx3 0 psu should i check FE ATX3 0 no problemo yet gang
Its so convenient for some people when FE cable finally started melting Keyword finally Well someone will surely benefit from this whole thing Am still waiting for major YT channels to replicate this None so 's see
I'm so hyped for my rx 7900 xtx Feel bad for all the 4090 users
So whose house is burning down because of the 4090 I keep reading statements like that And again I still haven't seen any evidence or proof of how people are actually plugging in these chords I'm not denying anything is happening Simply plugging in the cord is hard to believe is what's making the thing heat up and melt These cords are not new They also went through a testing phase before they were adopted Companies don't just approve stuff because they feel like approving something There's a thing called specification Nvidia just doesn't make something up on the fly because it suits them Again I'm not saying nothing is happening but I think there's more here than we know Or that users aren't telling us It's got to be one or the other
Damn poor rich kids that dump 1600 into a card that turns into a fire hazard Life is so so hard
holy crap just use a power limit with stock adapter guys and then get another cable
Driver update to save the 4090 just like the 3080 release I m sure My 3080 Ti sitting pretty meow lol On the bright side if you are a Nvidia fanboi like me The 5000 series is going to be a monster
Hahahhahaha
Not fully inserted Next
If you're still using stock adapters at this point you really do get what you deserve No it shouldn't be happening but simple fact is that it is happening and you shouldn't use the adapter Either get a new adapter from a third party or don't use the card until a fix is resolved
Ahh shit Now I need to check my FE again
Why so many tiny pins when it could just be two big ones or maybe even some big ol automotive battery terminals for us to clamp some jumper cables onto and hook it up to a semi truck battery
I'm so happy my card is vertically mounted in my HAF 700 Evo using the cablemod cable The side mounted cards out way to much stress on the connector and theres nothing you can do about it The 16pin placement on all the cards is crap
Im waiting on that recall class action at this point
I just want to know if any 450w cards are getting burnt or it's just the ones with the 600w bios
Are there any news of 3rd party cables melting If not thats the way to go i guess
I'm confused your fe came with a 4 input cable I got a msi trio not the oc version and it came with a 3 input cable I thought only overclocked cards came with the 4 input power cable So far the problem seems to be only 4 input power cable connectors I don't know if that's the standard for all cards or not but my cable definitely only has 3 power inputs
You d think Nvidia would learn that eventually you gotta stop pumping more juice and start learning how to make the most of the juice you re putting in
With the raving performance I ve been seeing with the 4090 I was pretty bummed I couldn t afford it at the time of release Now I m glad I couldn t as my plans for purchasing have changed Seeing all this blow up alongside NVIDIA s stupid choices lately I m really reconsidering avoiding their future products
NVIDIA is only getting away with this for now because it hasn't gotten bad enough yet and they make computer parts The first fire will be blamed on the user The next few fires will be explained away with statistics If this happened in any other industry investors would be freaking out Imagine having to plug in your refrigerator just right or it could catch on fire It sounds silly but I've seen fridges with smaller sticker prices than 4090s This connector needs to be sunk cost until it gets figured out
On that note guess I ll wait until the TI s come out
So the card runs with only 3 of the 4 adapters plugged in I have all 4 plugged in One cable piggybacking
salutes my 30 series
Has Nvidia made a statement about this yet
I think the safest thing to do is reinsert the cable until it starts clicking every time then put the wire upwards And put as little stress on the top pins as possible I will put a waterblock on my 4090 this week and see if my cable keeps getting too hot to touch
well we told you not to buy it lol
It is funny how all nvidia fan boys made jokes about people using amd cards would end up burning their houseface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
As a 3090 FE owner I'm glad I didn't upgrade right away Looks like a great time for me to switch to the 7900 XTX or wait until the next generation FWIW the last time I bought an AMD card was in 2003 as ATI
god damn imagine warranty running out of this thing and you got 3 or 4 new on rmas during its lifetime sheez can you imagine this guys They gonna lose 4x the money for replacements and cards value after warranty will be off will plummet
Damn looks like I m sticking to my 1660ti for Darktide cries
Are y'all getting refunds or replacements for these or like what is going on
Send it to gamers nexus
Are other adapters burning or just the cheapo one included
Case 4756
will the darktide launch melt my gpu
Damn that pennies down the drain Feels sad man
lel imagine
and another one
Whoomp there it is
Does nvidia just not care
I smell a
Welp there went my safety net No FEs till now Ah well At least it s good to know they RMAd
Corsair said it is your fault because you didn't plugged the adapter well Nvidia hasn't said anything yet
looks like a faulty pin and or socket loose at the metal even if the plastic is tight I do know that they draw a huge amount of juice so any pins not in complete contact will burn maybe they should add another power line so draw is split up lol could you imagine lol
u CableMod the only one that is holding is your cable If it burns you will provide warranty on the graphics cards You will stand up by your cables
Could it be that the connector has a circle with 2 interruptions like this I saw a theory that being designed like this the pin of the gpu could touch just 1 of the 2 part of the circle and so the power is concentrated on just 1 of them
They really need to sort this This is going to stop a lot of people upgrading to a 4090 before it is
All these posts makin' me paranoid lmao
R I P
It's great that OP got a replacement but what if you live in a country where there's no customer service and the card is priced at 2500 at retailers
Has there been any confirmed CableMod cables burning up yet Also cablemod can you let me know when I will be getting my order
I ll stick to my 3090 FE and laugh 4090 should ve been avoided by everyone so they could drive price down Solid card even after the 40 series launch
Oh my God how scary is that
Did you ask for some refound at nvidia for the damage I m curious witch is their excuses
nVidia could market it as the after burner
Bruh l
And here i am happy with my rtx3070
Can we just call it already Massive recall RMA make the entire plug out of asbestos
I can just imagine the controversy that s gonna happen with the kingpin like galax card The thing has 2 12VHPWR plugs that can each pull up to 600 w each So basically 1200W max for the entire card skull
Nvidia really need to make a statement it's unbelievable how quiet they've been over this whole thing And it's pretty disgusting if they're genuinely trying to pretend it's something they don't have to acknowledge Your new flagship product has an occasional occurrence of FUCKING MELTING
Maybe that was what NVIDIA As waiting for to say something
Yeah I am pretty annoyed as I based ordering all my new pc parts around the 4090 and they have all arrived and are sitting right there just waiting now Kind of glad they were just drip feeding 4090 stock to Canada and it was impossible to get a non OC Tuf card since that was what I backordered originally and there was no sign of it ever showing up then news came out of this melting nonsense and was trying to get a FE thinking they were safe and now that's a no go so I am considering going with AMD for the first time ever after this nonsense With no meaningful word from Nvidia it doesn't bode well that there is an imminent 't need to buy that 1200W ATX 3 0 PSU after all thanks Nvidia
Aint worth the hassle knowing that it has the potential to catch fire I started my return today with bestbuy I just wait for the for the 7900xtx for now I Just use my 2080ti Even had a cablemod cable still processing probably should cancel it if I can or exchange for something else
I am so glad I have kept my 3090 and 3090 Ti I will use them for another year thanks
What is the magical number of 30 reports referring to
I want to know this 1 How did Nvidia miss this during testing 2 how can customers get a full refund
Des internautes se plaignent que leur carte graphique Nvidia fond ocid msedgntp cvid 0d076b8fdffc4dc7b5916fe2098d28f3 you are in Radio Canada now
This type of connector looks like it doesn't make a good click when fully seated on Some users may have though their connector is firmly and snuggly connected while it's not and protuding about a millimeter off the card When routing the cable it can go off a couple millimeters and bend a little which makes a poor contact that heats up quickly and can melt the plastic Steve from GN made a great video about this issue and the theory they have is very likely to be the cause here Problem is why Nvidia bother to use this connector instead of 3 4 8pin PCIE power connectors Isn't the card big enough to carry those connectors This connector runs so close to the current limit that even a millimeter off the connector and you could run it out of spec with a 4090 It's like not putting a headphone jack on a phone that is so big it's thicker than a closed z flip
Hard to tell if u socketed it all the way or not I would follow up with an RMA with Nvidia
for something that pushes so much current I would have loved for them to have made the connectors a blade style interface like pcie cards Would have been solid AF
But would it matter since that card will also burn Or what is the difference now
Yep so much for the theory that it was an AIB power design problem
Dang we re all doomed
A shame really This card is so great
Fuck me
Going to have to start putting a fire hazard warning on their products unironically
The FE stands for Fire Emergency
How many time we're going to teach you old man
And official NVIDIA adapter
It was all part of their master plan 4D chess
maybe but me personally waiting for 7900 XTX would never buy a 2 years old shit for that asking price if 7900XTX turned to be a disappointment then i'd rather fallback to 6950 XT with the heavily discounted prices now
Also it will help them to spend a little fortune to fix this mess if they care
4090's are making my 3090 look like a better investment with each passing day Like damn having a 2000 dollar card have to sit in a box because you don't know if its going to burn your house down is wild to me
bUt DiD iT cLiCk s
Other then making sure it wasn t bent how was it seated All good as far as you were able to tell
Good to hear of the immediate RMA thanks for the report This is the first substantiated FE burning I think
Statement coming from Nvidia lol they are silent
Was this the 3 cable adapter I'm pretty sure you want to use 4 cables I'm not an expert but I thought I saw a video where the cables are usually only spec'd for 150 watts so for max 600watts you would want the power spread across 4 cables
Did you up the power limit to 600w
Did it make an audible click sound when you inserted the adapter into the gpu
why three cables it must be 4 or wee see here power disbalance
I opened up a return on my 4090 with newegg I might just send it back and settle on a 3090 ti till this gets sorted
its the heat causing it theres no
how do you have contact Nvidia Over their Homepage or do you have a working Email adress from Nvidia
Wait why three and not four The adapter has four pci 8 pins
Did they send you a new in box unit or no
I bought a 4090 FE also from Best Buy and I won t be installing it until either a cablemod ships my cable or b nVidia makes a statement
I also bought mine from Best Buy and now I m thinking of returning it
Fascinating
Was it plugged to the fullest extent that it can go into the card I only ask because Gamers Nexus just posted a video on their findings and say that this happens largely because users are not plugging the card in as much as it can go and that wiggling the adapter messes the seating up
Yes they're no longer immune disappointed face Interesting they only had 3 cables plugged in
There was a Chinese YouTube video which mentioned another FE melting as well but no photos were shown At least we now know there's no brand AIB that is immune to this issue
Out of many
not the first there was another in taiwan but it wasn't posted on reddit to my knowledge so it never made the mega thread
It's worth noting that you can see one of the cables going to the connector is pulled out with exposed wire Either a QC issue on the adapter or OP bent it and told us he didn't
The stock cable is guaranteed to burn your house down so don't void your warranty
The only remaining option left is cablemod So far they seem to work I guess we will see in time
If there's actually a software glitch in how the 4090 balances the current draw over the separate pins my sides will enter low earth orbit
width 1630 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s fd9ad4554eb12064b6195b8c61aad69c7aeb513b Oh boy I m not excited about that
The current theory at the moment is that the connector is too tight and sometimes when people plugged it in they did not realize it is not fully inserted With that theory then the brand really doesn t matter
I 's totally unprecedented and 7 melted cables means everyone is fucked
What a fun launch huh Lmfao in reality ive said fuck it Its not like you wont get a new card if ur adapter melts
Funfact 1 Brand means fire in german
Close After EVGA and now this Come on now Their lack of response isn't helping at all either
For the most part Nvidia can literally do anything they want and the majority of their following will not care Eventually even this ordeal will be forgotten and they will continue to run the market
You can't tell me they didn't know something I hope we find out more with a class action lawsuit Find out Jensen knew about it and sold them anyway
If nvidia allow them to use legacy 3x8pin EVGA might still be around I guess EVGA see the shit show they will walk into and with almost no profit to earn Might as well quit whole thing
Present man facepalming They need to release a statement now I ll eat my words nom nom nom Rip to all the 4090 owners Rip I ll hold off then until this is all fixed
Why does proposing a theory based on current evidence make one a dumbass When you hear hoofbeets you think horses not zebras
Big brain computer users
Me neither time to open the case
guess ill be using that warranty up quite abit maybe 5 or 6 burnt cards lol
gif giphy 10JhviFuU2gWD6 Of course
Even worse The 4080 is a 1200 xx70 card succeeding the 3070 which was 500 So 2 5x the price for the same tier of performance
The root cause is Nvidia is running the connector too close to its maximum power handling capability Each pin is running just a hair below max rating as well which means any problem on one or more pin s can push others over their thresshold too It s not a massive overload so more insidious than spectacular Anything that reduces the current through that connector will reduce the chances for overload and give the connector more headroom for possible connector and connection issues Downclocks and undervolting will also buy headroom
Nobody knows the cause so nobody knows if that will help
scalper laugh at you people still selling their kidney to buy 4090
Like apples response with reception issues on the iphone you're holding it wrong Steve Jobs Such gross arrogance by nvidia on this whole thing They could have just made a statement recall the garbage and move on with life Instead they're pretending its not an issue at all risking major fire hazards being ignored Kinda like nintendo and the drifty joy cons Silence after all these years I guess at least they fix them for free after warranty Like pleading no contest in court yea I'm guilty but too arrogant to actually admit I did anything wrong
That's insulting If it was that easy to cause the issue why didn't this happen on older cards
4090 Ti melted PSUs it won t be released Unless they figure out power delivery and power consumption
They are investigating per latest article by Kitguru d rather them fully understanding the issue and come up with proper solution
It s sickening We ll have to continue to report to until Nvidia makes an official announcement
It's up to consumers to protect themselves If no one forces Nvidia into a recall now they will wait to see if people start a class action later They are saying so what are you going to do about it basically
did you have all 4x 8 pin connectors plugged in or just 3 like the OP Also did you have the power slider voltage slider maxed out 600W 133 and 1 10V Seem sketchy tbh
Hopefully it will just go black screen like OP and they will send the system in for repair
It won t because the oem technicians are not some sloppy 16 years old who can t properly insert a cable So yeah OEMs are fine
lmao I know it sucks but its like there were people just rooting for it to happen to a FE ding ding ding we have a winner
because I get 100 more frames and I have buyer protection from Best Buy
Because the percentage is still very low and I have a warranty
Because there are no issues with mine
Say YOLO when you plug it in and hope for the best
Because as long you bought the card through official means there isn't really a concern about support They'll replace it Kinda inconvenient though
It's like saying ''Why people still using samsung phones they explode '' when that was a thing back then It's because the percantage of it is extremely low You just saw people who has that problem No person will open a thread and say 'my card is perfectly fine ' The card sold probably more than hundred thousands units and we only saw couple of them burned
Ah yes the FE a card readily available weeks after launch I'm sure they went out and bought it after the problems started
Goes both ways No idea if OP partially inserted it And people are making the same house burning down joke when there's no evidence it's going to set your entire system on fire So both extremes are present
I doubt it's MSI's PSUs specifically They are really the only atx 3 0 ones that you have been able to buy for the past month or two and they are built solid from what I've seen
At this point just don t use the adapter as it s more common to have those adapter melting As for the Msi psu u can always think of it as a fluke for now or even user error as we haven t yet to find new case of that even tho the psu is already being sold everywhere
Get your money back Return it where you got it citing safety concerns most places will take it back even after return period when things turn into a safety issue
took me awhile to find a post with your suggestion for total recall
I mean IDK how you keep using your 4090 after seeing all this They obviously have no idea what the cause is No telling how safe any of them are
Nah
They are investigating but thats pretty much all they said
You do know that the adapter has burned even under 450W loads That s the same as what the 3090 Ti FE had
The 3090 Ti uses the same connector and same power draw 450 W as the 4090 FE and I haven't heard any reports of it melting Very odd The only difference I can think of is the sense pins
Its everywhere
This PSU melted twice If I recall correctly we didn t confirm if the owner properly inserted both ends of their native cables
I'd say just use it but keep your nose open for the smell of melting plastic
Oh so we aren t allowed to hypothesize
Its the first one reported on reddit seems like
The 3090ti uses the same connector and I have not heard of reports of melting
The 30 series uses a completely different cable than the 40 series Not even comparable
Personally I think the issue is a small number of defective adapters The 4090 adapters use a somewhat unique construction where some plastic molding or at least joining of the housing is done after the terminals are in place just looks at the teardowns If any plastic overflows into the inside of the terminals it will insulate those pins Most Molex style connectors mold the housing and then the terminals snap into place
Both the way the adapter is assembled assuming you are using an adapter and the connector housing on the adapter or cable is different There haven't been any issues with 3090Tis now whether this is because 1 It's a card side issue 2 The difference in the adapter connector 3 Something else there are reports of it not just being Nvidia adapters melting I don't think the pins themselves are incapable of carrying the current needed since you correctly point that the 3090Ti offers similar power draw and uses the same pins in albeit a different connector housing with no problems
Yes they already sent me a replacement 4090
Nobody knows yet
Card
Yeah at these prices it should just work without issues I don't understand how they never came across this issue at all It's a lot of wattages the thing is sucking down and that should have made them nervous and thorough
Feel the same way I would like to know though some details did they ru it with the full 600 watts and then card name PSU and cable used I have had no issues yet either on my MSI 4090 gaming Trio using a Thermaltake GF3 1000W atx 3 0 and their cables for card
I returned the 4090 FE and bought an Asus ROG Strix 4090 the day before Gamers Nexxus posted his video I also bought the new MSI MPG psu I m gonna use a hammer to ensure the native cable goes all the way in this time around grinning face
I used my 3090 Ti with my ThermalTake GF3 for a week without any issues Then plugged it into my 4090 No issues yet luckily EDIT no I didn t buy a 4090 on top of my 3090 Ti I returned my 3090 Ti as it was 2 weeks old after getting a 4090
Same Fingers crossed they get here quick Mine shipped on November 5th but they didn't reach EU yet by what I'm being told
YOLO
It s a small percentage of cable burn up compared to how many 4090s have been sold It may seem a lot on reddit but it s super small of amount of whats actually been sold and burned
Yes I made sure it clicked in place and I also made sure that the 3 cables weren t pulling down on the adapter
He said ASUS Thor 1200w
hahahahaha
Maybe we have reached the limit for gpu wattage without a whole new type of power connector But that's exactly what this was a new power connector It was designed by PCI SIG
Doubt it lol
If you can actually find the Corsair cable in stock
Same but now they can move onto the next excuse I can't wait until Nvidia eventually lands on a conclusion so the arguments can end lol
We still have the braindead crowd with ItS jUsT mEltIng
I'd still be careful there's no guarantee their cable is safe Native cables have melted too Nobody knows the real issue yet
Unfortunately the connectors are tin plated which they need to be to match the tin plated connectors used on the boards That should explain the issue Tin plating was probably the wrong choice for this connector though some bean counter probably got a bonus for saving some money on the spec Tin has problems with heat and with heat cycling It oxidizes and corrodes tin plating This is why I suspect this will be an insidious problem that won t go away If that article by one of the world s largest connector companies is any guide we can expect failures to grow in from normal use without some other measures to stabilize the connection and that starts getting technical This is going to be a huge issue for Nvidia The longer they delay addressing it the bigger it s going to get
My cable will arrive tomorrow
Yea they cnat just give you special treatment
Sure it s my fault Nothing wrong with the GPU and adapter Go buy one when you can
All
That it will work like other GPUs
Honestly how much did you pay for that 3080ti back then
Buying new tech doesn't make people dumb We aren't the ones that designed and implemented poorly developed tech
Yup I m dumb lol
I had a nightmare that my 4090 only had 3080ti level performance and woke up in a cold sweat
had the same dream for my gigabyte 3080 ti
Galax aib had to pump 1200W over 20mins to get to 110c its actually an overbuilt connector in his words and the words of the founder of cybernetics
Undervolting doesn t stop the cable from having poor contacts which is causing a build up of heat It s the adapter Undervolting wouldn t do anything other than make the card less hot
If it had been throughly tested there wouldn t have been 30 cases on Reddit and a similar or a greater number outside of it
These cords are not new The circumstances are
Fully inserted to a click in this case stop it
Copium Next
Yeah sorry gotta work too It s not on us that it is taking Nvidia almost a month to make a statement or that 3rd party cables are taking too long to deliver or that 3rd party cables melt too and we re all still beta testing them
Don t insert the piggybacked 8 pin connector use 4 separate cables for the 4 adapter slots If you adapter has 4 connectors insert 4 cables
they are making these cards for nothing it says made in china on it
I got a replacement 4090 from NVIDIA
That's without a single doubt
No melting 12VHPWR cables from us as of now And may I know your order number what you ordered and when
They sent me a replacement 4090
If you're not getting the 4090 anymore please reach out to our support to request an order cancellation asap
I get it s a joke but the rate of them burning has to be less than 1 highly doubt it happens again to op glad they got him a new card in three days tho
god damn so they give new card after this And for how long before its going to happen again Imagine this shit out of warranty I imagine the value on this will plummet
lol so you guarrentee that card will burn too funny shit
There is probably about 100 cases out of 120k ''that card will also burn''
It's the same pin going out too every time What's happening there
Those were just dumb people who didn't understand that the FE is a very rare model that very few people will manage to get which is why you don't see it with burnt adapters very often They think ASUS Gigabyte MSI are the cause because those are the most common cards that show up with burnt connectors when the real reason for their commonality is that those brands are the most readily available ones across the world For example getting an FE in Europe is next to impossible but walk into any retailer and you'll see ASUS Gigabyte MSI everywhere
Wasn't a theory so much as it was idiotic fanboyism
I havnt kept up to date Do we know if any third party cables have failed yet
Watch jayz2cents video on it it explains the problem perfectly it's actually the way they merge two 8 pins to 12 pins any slight bend can destroy the outer most connections on the pins
People are really dumb The assumptions are endless The fact is we have less 12vhpwr cables burning now than we had 8 pins and 12 pins burning on the 30 series launch and the supply of cards were much lower PC cables burn all the time I don't even think nvidia would consider 0 01 of cards having a problem is an actual problem moreso an outlier than can be fixed with QC tighter tolerances It's like 15 out of 125 150k 8pins 12 pins sata and molex burn at a much higher rate than 0 01
Nvidia themselves can have different cables unless they have only 1 source it's still not 100 guarantee for having the same cables for them
That was a dumb theory to begin with considering we KNOW its user error
this tends to happen when one develops a theory based on no evidence
That's the pitfall of being an early adapter
No we are fine just don't buy 4090
Nah still waiting to grab one
greatly expensive you mean
6d chess helps the competition sell their gpu supply so when they run out nvidia will be the only one left with gpu supply
4D90 chess
Not everybody wants to use AMD cards In fact most people don't
Under normal circumstances id agree with you but most of the 30 series was available on deep discount a few weeks ago 3080 ti for 850 3090 for 950 and the pandemic caused basically a year of tech delay around the world So even tho the cards are technically 2 years old theyre really only like a year Youll see this in software delays of newer game titles and supply delays in the 40 series Of course non of this matters if you plan on buying amd s new cards and theyre is supply of them In that case fuck nvidia lol
I said this exact same thing on another post and got downvoted to hell
Put your 4090 in your home 's what I would do if I own a
i have a founders 4090 sitting in a box on my desk currently using 3080 untill i also hear a statement
Maybe not the house but nuking the 2 000 card doesn t seem that sexy either
I have a Aorus Master since a week after launch All I do is game in it for hours a day since my knee surgery and not one issue I ve used both the adapter and the native 12vhpwr cable with my ATX 3 0 PSU and it s still fine I wish we could get some info on why and how this is happening though
Making the 1080ti look like a better investment each 'm still going strong
I mean More 3090 s died playing new world then 4090 s have died from this adapter fiasco Not saying your card isn t awesome But holy shit people can get carried away
My 4090 Gigabyte OC Gamer sits in its box too Got a cable arriving tomorrow to be able to bring it up and run low power until my CableMod arrives No way I trust the Nvidia adapter
Ya I have yet to sell my 3090 for this reason I am running my 4090 but I am holding onto a solid card in case that id rather see in some other happy gamers hands than in my closet
It s not a 2000 card It s 1600
burn your house down is wild to me zero
With you every step of the way on this
It is an issue yes but i think burn down your house is a bit exaggerating The adapters melted but they are not sparking or catching on fire
It's a 1600 dollar card but yes it's goofy
Yep Never been happier about my 3090 kingpin and its 3 8 pins
1080 Ti VRM solder melting issues on some variants hint EVGA 2080 Ti Founder Editions with burned GPU's were a topic for the first 6 months with TURING 3090 had its unexplainable BY REVIEWERS NOT COVERED OR CONFIRMED for 6 MONTHS overheating issues with a low GPU DIE temperature till end of 2020 we got VRM VRAM Tjunction sensor data and it was clear what caused it poor thermal pads no thermal pads over hotspots I dont say the issues with the 4090 are better nor worse but ignoring early adopter issues with previous generations is not really fair A new GPU generation is basicly allways a shitshow and if you can avoid it till issues pop up and workarounds revisions are available it is rarelly worth it to deal with it if you want to use the hardware
Bought the Gigabyte 4090 OC on launch and it is still in the box sitting on pile of new build components Was gonna get the discounted 3090Ti but then changed my mind for whole new build aye aye aye Anybody know when those cablemod angled adapters will be released and will they make a difference I signed up on their waitlist and I think somewhere on their website it says at least 4 weeks wait
Big facts
Mine didn't click and I plugged it in as far as it will go Its a tiny connector it looks much bigger in photos I'm not sure you'd even hear it click It also seemed to go in REALLY easily which does have me concerned I checked three times to make sure it wouldn't go in any more I'm not worried about it burning the house down though its self extinguishing plastic and melting it takes a way way lower temperature than to start a fire Worst case it would short to ground and the PSU protection would kick in Also from what we've seen so far the plug seems to melt at a lower temperature than the socket
Yes I made sure it clicked in place and I also made sure that the 3 cables weren t pulling down on the adapter
I ll buy your 4090 lol
You know the 3090ti also uses a 12 pin power connector of the same dimensions right
The point is it shouldn't get that hot if its working correctly Something is causing uneven loading on the pins thus causing the heat
Just on their website under customer support
While it shouldn't matter given the problems it would seem sensible to use all four just in case
Yes new box with a different 4090 FE in it No changes revisions on the card and adapter
I would rather have an official Nvidia adapter fail rather than a third party adapter If the third party adapter fails and damages the card you may run into warranty issues
I can still return it
s the first FE card Not that it would have made a difference but it makes no sense to use only 3 cables on a ROG Thor when it has 6 cables that come with the PSU But I also understand 3 are nice premium cablemod braided ones and the rest are ugly seasonic stock ones D
Just like me I only connected 3 of the 4 PCIe cables What is your PSU
It's horrifying that the connector can still melt with a 450w power limit 600w seems excessive for a connector this small but seeing it melt at 450w is really bad and underscores how important and dangerous this adapter is When only three pcie are connected to the adapter the card detects this and hard limits power draw to 450w
Because the pins are all parallel circuits I would want everything as symmetric as possible The safest arrangement will be individual wires to crimped individual pins with parallel connector blocks added down the wire I would use either two connectors at the PCIe end like the Corsair cable or all four Three connectors works too but only on the individual pin versions In Nvidia s adapter the 4 pin sockets are soldered across all the pins Just use 3 of them and you aren t feeding that solder bridge as equally as you would with 4 These connectors seem very susceptible to imbalances that can really shift current loads and drive overheating
Yeah no proof on that one The video consist of the following 1 picture of the original Gigabyte adapter posted on this very subreddit Screenshot of text messages of someone claiming their FE melted no further proof The Youtuber proceeded in testing Gigabyte card This is why that video is not in the Megathread because it is not proven and you should take it with grains of salt It is probably fake and Wccftech did not check the video before posting their article
I just talked to Nvidia customer support and asked them directly about cablemod cables This is the response Sorry for the delay and thank you for your patience I check with the team Please do not buy any third party cable It may void warranty Okay last question Is there any approved Nvidia third party cables No Our cables come with our GPU We do not recommend any third party cables You can try to ask Nvidia support to see if you get a different answer
Corsair cable too
I have a Seasonic Prime TX1600 psu 2x8pin 12 pin with original cable I have no problem with more than a month ago Gainward rtx 4090
That gonna need to run as long as full length of the GPU warranty to prove it is not defective lol or equivalent lab testing that simulate the same thing
And the Fasgear adapter and direct to PSU cables They're great
Nah I saw one burned out here or pcmr a while ago
It always seems to be the cables on the ends the ones most susceptible to damage from bending Maybe they're being bent at the factory during testing But some people who have posted theirs specifically mention bending the everloving fuck out of their cables
That theory is wrong watch Gamers Nexus video and you will know why and there are plenty of other videos testing this theory and none was able to melt the cable It might make it worse but its not the cause
Probably not a coincidence Brand company product reputation comes from branding livestock with a hot iron There's also firebrand which is a burning stick
Nvidia has always been like this It has just been masked in we happen to have the best gpu's
Yeah but I mean close to people never buying nvidia again If they say nothing before 4080 launch I m getting a 7900xtx
Lol nobody outside the US gives a shit about evga Not to mention that evgas dumb decisions have nothing to do with nvidia to begin with For that matter 99 of all their customers will never even know neither about any evga thing nor this 99 of people never even look at top end cards or their issues The only way this'll affect nvidia is if the 70 80 series have the same problem
I would be really funny if EVGA knew all along what the problem actually is and decided to just stop making gpus and leaving us wondering what the actual cause of the issue is since nobody seems to be able to recreate the problem
Jensen knew You guys have a cult of personality problem lol
Agree
I ll hold off then until this is all fixed Can't buy one if you wanted too
Positing a theory doesn't make you a dumbass but the people who were defending the theory as being true didn't understand that we had too small a sample size to draw such conclusions definitively
Perfect response OK hand

Didn't igorlabs just do an LN2 overclocking pushing 900wts through that connector Meaning the cable and the spec on paper theoretically should be able to handle the rated power load on the cable Im more inclined to think of its the way the card is pulling load through the common power rail But I think that was debunked earlier too PCB side of the GPU
Safety margin in typical stock gaming load is at least 150W but can easily go up to over 400W safety margin for the 12VHPWR connector x200B Remember that while the connector is rated for up to around 680W 24 7 load the GPU is rated for a max of 450W anything above is overclocking some GPUs can't even go to 600W to begin with and optimized 4090s can't go above 360W x200B So the safety margin isn't the issue here
Not defending Nvidia and they could at least keep us informed on what they are currently doing to figure out what's wrong but I'm guessing they haven't released anything yet cuz it seems to be fairly difficult to actually reproduce the melting
That s what I m wondering Just seems odd that all the sudden it s become an issue It doesn t seem like it can be user error if it s this wide spread
It's also funny ppl keep buying 4090s even though to issue isn't fixed and they're burning wires knowing it's going to happen
The better way could be figuring out and having this issue pop up during development testing and it seems Nvidia chose to cosplay CDPR when it came to quality
I had all 4 connected and my card is completely stock No OC I feel like it blows pass my 175hz monitor lol So no need to OC it
According to cablemod they worked with Nvidia to create the adapter
Tbf some of them probably are face with tears of joy
I was rooting cuz it was only AiBS but now FEs finally they will address this
There s ThermalTake too Which is more readily available than MSI btw
We also have TT GF3s that have all been sold out
The adapter is different the 3090Ti one isn't common bus soldered Not saying that is the issue just pointing out the adapter is different Also the connector housing is different on the adapter it's just a standard 12 pin for the 3090Ti where for the 4090 it's the 12 4 That different connector could cause a mating issue or pin securement issue
Got a link to the thread
Aw fingers crossed mine won t end up that way face with tears of joy
First one The taiwanese one has no proof and they use the adapter picture from the first Gigabyte melting that was posted here So you should take it with grains of salt See my comment here context 1
12pin cable melted in my 3080fe
Not the FE My 3090 FE uses the same connector minus the little sense pins on top
But there's recent incidents of native 12 pin cables melting from MSI ATX 3 0 PSUs
Oh good to know Hope that doesn't happen with mine grinning face with sweat
yeah there is no way to know if this problem will occur on working cards currently but will melt in future a few years down the line when warranty is over EVGA might have covered it but probably not these other AIB or nvidia lol
click doesn't mean anything if the pin is angled wrong and split the female terminal
You mean 4 right Also how long was it running until this happened
Well folks there s your proof It can happen to any card no matter how well it is plugged in It s not user error Some tolerance was not specked correctly in the manufacturing process There needs to be a total recall on these things At this rate it might happen right as rdna 3 launches too man facepalming
So you were not using the 4 cables as per the recommendation Also the adapter doesn't really do a loud click as many of said My Corsair native cable does but the adapter doesn't like it
At least in Europe they were very easy to get before this shit storm I got mine 2 days before the 4090s release day
Yeah this entire issue as a whole is ridiculous
So if we use copper on the female side it won t fix the melting Do both sides need to be made out of different metal
I doubt it the narrative of you didn t connect the cable all the way Nvidia designed a bad connector and they know about it internally which is why they aren t denying people replacements Only the belps on Reddit are claiming its user error
Is there any graph showing the confirmation Etc I've had my zotac 4090 since launch day no issues UK here
Higher voltage wants better insulation Higher amperage wants larger conductors and more surface area on the conductor contacts Wattage is part of the situation and can help you calculate the amps volts at play But insulator thickness is based on voltage alone Conductor thickness is based on amperage alone Together you get a 'wire' that carries 'watts' But 'wires' and 'watts' are both secondary calculations Like a jumper cable implies at least 14v capable wire insulation of extremely thick conductors for 200 amps That's why its just basic rubber insulation over a super thick conductor Only the amps really matter for what we're talking about Also happens to be 12v just like the nvidia adapter Think about that too Jumping a car or starting a car is like 200 amps at 12v and a giant alligator bite contactor for each terminal The 4090 can pull in 50 amps at 12v But the cabling and connector looks WAY smaller than 1 4th of a jumper cable Just the giggle test again This adapter and standard are a total laugh to anyone that has ever looked at high amperage connectors Also a tiny 30awg wire can handle 600watts if the voltage is high enough Look at the cabling of the 500 000 volt power line structures feeding the town the conductors in those cables are barely bigger than a set of jumper cables Those structures carry mega watts but only at 100amps All the wattage is in the voltage end Vs a car and an nvidia adapter the majority of the watts are in the amperage end both are really low voltage at 12v
Yep debauer pulled 700W with no issues too
Got it that makes sense
I just removed the 4090 and put my old card back in Waiting for the cablemod cable What a shame this launch was
G121645 CableMod C Series Pro ModFlex Sleeved 12VHPWR Cable Kit for Corsair RM Black Label RMi RMx October 28th with a ship date of November 11th
Can you confirm that there will be no problems with the RMA process if I use 12VHPWR cable from you and it accidentally melts
That's 100 that are on social media This definitely appears to be a real issue unlike the cap issue on 3080s
Yeah Nvidia will probably just consider these outliers until and unless they start seeing a bigger of defective cards cables
make me
It's either the power or ground pin if it's the point of highest resistance in the circuit the heat will build up there Looks like they simply under engineered the connecter or they are having issues with overcurrent
needs another power line to divide the draw or make a better plug and receiver bigger pins and heavier wire
Classical Base Rate Fallacy
And now they will say OP is a careless user that plug it
They think somehow ALL the manufacturers made this mistake on their own
You also have to assume that some damaged connectors will have just been RMA'd without posting pictures to reddit or whatever
add in that many people never bother with posting on reddit or forums we tend to be a bit myopic and believe everyone and their mother hops on reddit
Most of the FEs are on Ebay lol
idiotic fanboyism Bingo
Yes at least 2
you are the only dumb mofu here you are comparing millions of 8pins molex sata for many years against just small entity of people who own 4090 that is relatively a new card using the new shit connector that its the first time to be used or to be phrased better as Beta Tested whats funnier is you are calling people dumb and then carry on saying The fact what an idiot LMAO
Crypto is peanuts compare to Jensen CEO chess moves
Which is why he said personally
Cool no one told you use an AMD card
Oh I fully expect to be in the downvote category soon enough I'm not here to win karma awards anywaygrinning squinting face
haha might as well embrace it it is difficult say something to get enough people from community that hates to listen then proceed to massive downvote you without breaking reddit rules anyway
500 IQ brain heregrinning squinting face
I fully expect they won't make a statement until well after 4080 stock is gone So maybe on the 17th
Same I'm also on a 3080 no intentions of upgrading this gen even if I did staying away from RTX 4000
Exactly same as me still in unsealed box just waiting on nvidia
Sane here I have a 4090fe right behind me but will stay of my 3090fe until they figure out what's going on I got it through BestBuy and due to when I bought it I have until the end of January to take it to get my money back
So Unsexy
Same had my gaming OC since day one and have been gaming heavily with a native 12vhpwr cable Using the TT atx3 0 PSU and have not run into an issue at all I still turn my desktop off when not using just in case it suddenly does fail someday but I easily play games minimum 4 hours every night and have the PC running all day while I work So far everything points to not fully seating the cable as that's the only way people have been able to reproduce the melting but even then it's hard to pin point what's actually going wrong Hopefully we get an actual statement from Nvidia soon But that seems doubtful
I am in process of finally upgrading from the 1080 i bought at launch over 6 years ago and been happy enough using xbox gamepass in 4k but bought the 4090 at launch for a brand new build It is still sitting in the box SMH
When do you think you'll upgrade I have a 1080ti too I told myself to wait till performance wise the 1080ti is just as good as a xx60 I think a 4060 might hit that mark It gets along in newer games but I usually have to choose between graphics or fps
I've still got a 3070 i play 1080P so im happy enough for another year or so
This sitting on my 3090 as well happy as can be raising hands medium light skin tone
Same card using nvidia adapter 53 hrs on my first run through cp2077 with it Power limit 33 210core 500mem and according to hwinfo64 523 max draw and 470 on average Zero damage so far Don't fear the reaper
more like 1700 w taxes included
Maybe not in the US In here european here they start at 2000 2k for the cheapest Aibs
really Tell me where I can get it for 1600 please because all im seeing is 2000
didn't someone's station at an apartment catch on fire and neighbors put it out
The biggest concern would be acrylic plexiglass the window side panels on highly custom cases or lower cost cases Acrylic Plexiglass can burn The adapters can be right up against the windows especially in systems that have issues in this case After that all you need is drapes curtains carpet rugs trash whatever
Dude really We just had an argument do we need to have another Yeah that risk is low but it exists Melted plastic is a fire hazard you can get smoking you can get flame People are pulling the adapters as they catch them melting Is anybody going to run a furmark loop while they're off on a weekend in the Hamptons with this thing No no they are not
False you just build your PC into an old oven and add some ventilation
Should be the first or second week of December yep
Thanks for the info
Don't you love it when the industry mouth found that one picture showing it was 1mm not plugged in fully Suddenly everyone YOU DIDN'T PLUG IT IN FULLY DUMMY Don't forget they are saving their own asses by putting the blame on Gamers that already pay a ton for these overly hiked up prices
Looking here I can see it wasn t plugged in correctly
Nah I d rather send it back if i decide not to keep it
unless they're using very thick wires and pins which dont seem to be the case i think 600watts of heat will surely heat that single small plastic connector especially at a warm
Was it a phone call or chat email I couldn't find a phone number and WISH I did because I'm now stuck in an email exchange with their useless support over all the crashes I'm getting and they're taking multiple days to respond each time Freaking furious With Asus EVGA etc in the past you get a phone number and talk to a smart support person who understands and works with you quickly to come to a conclusion This email back and forth shit is taking forever to get a resolution
As per the manual I only needed 3 cables to power up the card From what I know 4th cable is only needed for more power when overclocking the card I may be wrong
Heat didn't understand the aesthetic disappointed face
My cablemod is 3x8 as my hx1500i only needs two outlets from the PSU for 600w So 3 is even more cautious than the Corsair cable which is only two outlets from the PSU
jayz gamersnexus and others have not been able to melt one still just got them to 100c if not plugged in properly This guy even went to 50 Amps and damaging the solder joins testing
Can you forward me that email to thomas
That's idiotic by extension this would mean using your ATX 3 0 PSUs factory cables also voids card warranty
How would they know you used a 3rd party cable
Still shady fucking answer with may void wtf Nvidia just have a clear answer on whether yes or no
Very Strange all this pile of poo Jayz video from yesterday on Do third party cables void Warranty interesting video and apparently Some lawyer has started a class action lawsuit Yet Jensen still hiding under his mommy s bed telling her to make it all go away
Can we get cablemod to chime in here Im using a cable mod cable does that void my warranty u cablemod
They don't want to spend any time money to qualify 3rd party cables so they just say don't use it to cover themselves and prevent liability Yet it seems they didnt even bother to qualify their own cable
CableMod specifically will cover your card if it's damaged by their cables They've said as much So I wouldn't about your warranty being void using them That said I do hope Nvidia realizes that it's actually illegal to void customer warranties for using a third party product so long as they can't show their adapter is necessary for device function The tie in clause of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act specifically forbids that and puts the onus on Nvidia to prove So by voiding warranties they would open themselves up for the possibility of an unwinnable class action lawsuit
Support reps say one thing and then other reps do it differently all the time Unless an official statement is made all that other stuff is just copy paste filler comments
Yeah in fact it says in the warranty using other cables may void your warranty
Better to be out the warranty than burn the house down
I'd bet that the only reason they have to say that is if someone uses some homemade junk or something really sketchy They would never reject an RMA because of a normal third party cable like on a PSU that would be insane and I'm a little bothered by how far this story got
The fabled Corsair cable that allegedly exists but no one other than a couple of youtubers actually has
I ordered a PX 1600 with the same cables so that's good to know
yeah i just got a px 1600 and was surprised the 12 pin connector was even greased it got in effortless on a 4090 fe
I just can't wrap my head around the idea that this cable requires such exact pin alignment to be operated safely If the cable is designed and manufactured correctly the pins should align and clamp with enough force to make good contact It shouldn't be depending on pins being aligned to such small tolerances
Not really the case my conector was plugged in only halfway for most of the time it literally got out of the port on its own on 2 different occasions and the pc booted for hours without any problem i did eventually find out that the conector was not plugged in properly and i just ordered a better cable that did go in all the way
Someone was able to melt the cable what are you talking about 110c in 20 minutes will melt the cable do you want to see the video Plus gamers nexus is still testing all this shit and soon will show all the new tests He said in the first video they couldn't test the unseated cable because they couldn't get it to boot Teclab worker from Galax AIB pushed 1200W through the cable to get it to 110c Then had it horizontally unseated slightly and it went to the same temp in 20 mins 110c in 20mins at 450W is fucked and will melt your cable if play cyberpunk for an hour or benchmark for an hour
I bet EVGA was only one testing the gpu in accurate sweaty moist gaming environment with gamer farts in the air Its the only missing link
What s wrong with AMD gpu s
Since you observed it the outcome changed
You just used up your last connection cycle Don't plug it back
Thing is now you unplugged what if it starts melting since you've change it's state lol
For now
Keep in mind that this connector has only 30 connection cycles So you're at least at round no 28
It's still a very small percentage of cards that this is happening to though Yes we're seeing a bunch of reddit posts about this but that's out of over 100k sold A ton of youtube channels have been trying hard to reproduce this but haven't been able to
I guess a majority of people are plugging the cables in correctly is my gusss
I bought mine on launch day and haven t built it for other reason but I plan to build mine later this month maybe during Thanksgiving break Hope Nvidia has identified the issue by then
And none of them are demanding their money back If Nvidia knows you don't give a shit about the safety of it and let them keep the money when they won't ever give a shit about it Just like the vram failures of the 2080ti just like the failures before
Considering nobody has managed to reproduce the issue in a
Unless the melting adaptors deviated from the specs on production cablemod is selling the exact same thing
I think they were probably aware of this problem also affecting FEs for a awhile now Remember not everyone comes on to reddit to share their issue or posts online about it There may have been a few melted FEs out in the wild that we weren't aware about prior to this post
Go sort all posts on this sub as hot and find the megathread The full list is there
Just dont leave your computer on without someone in the room P
EVGA might have covered it but probably not these other AIB or nvidia lol Gottem
Its nearly impossible to detect all flaws in a new design for something if it fails you will get a replacement Nobody has recorded a single fire hazard from this situation
People here are quick to ridicule others and blame it on user error but fail to understand why there is an error in the first place
You needed to follow this sub in order to know I can tell you that Spain South Korea China russia had confirmed cases by now apart from the US
that escalated quickly
What's not clear You asked to let you know when you'll get your order but I need to know what your order is to check on that
I can't confirm how other companies will choose to handle RMA process I can only confirm we will act in case they just choose to not handle them at all
no thats like 25 on social media
48 v desktop when
if it's the point of highest resistance in the circuit the heat will build up there This is only true in a series circuit When components are in parallel it's actually the lowest resistance component that creates the most heat
Resistance with that much current is going to cause problems Assuming 100 efficiency it's somewhere around 50 to 60 amps of current for 600 watts That's an awful lot for those pins given how small and how few there are I know asthetics are important but a double 8 pin or double 12 would have been a safer option
Still trying to grasp it but thanks for linking
That still seems the most plausible thing that is happening My asus strix 4090 had the adapter since the first day I got it when they came out Made sure it was really well connected Just unplugged it cause I finally got my cablemod cable and there was no damage whatsoever and I was overclocking the card and increasing power and voltage to the max with msi afterburner
Manufacturers didn t make these adaptors They re outsourced and delivered to them hence why they re identical
FEs didn't die when new world was killing GPUs but AIBs did It's not entirely unfounded
they dont just build to spec given by nvidia said design has to be sanctioned by nvidia so if its a design flaw then its as much nvidias faulti i would say
14 or 15 out of 150k 0 01 There is nothing wrong with the connector That has been proven This isn't the first time the connector has been used I was not referring to millions I specifically said 30 series launch Let me break it down so even the most simple minded people can understand 30 series had lower supply at launch 30 series had more cases of burning cables Reddit has the receipts So yes the people making assumptions that there is a problem are indeed morons What is someone who blindly goes against all the facts to suit their own argument if not a moron A mindless drone maybe Anything else I need to spell out for you You can not win an argument that is grounded on baseless assumptions though I'm sure you'll try anyway Sorry if what I'm saying isn't popular I tend to look at the actual results produced instead of 14 15 reddit posts Maybe stop typing and think for a moment
Yeah I never said anyone did The comment sounded like the only option is buy amd if you don't want to buy 3000 series Amd is not an option for most of the customers since most customers doesn't prefer to buy amd gpu's over nvidia cards despite the prices But yeah it all comes to presonal preferences Some people are willing to pay premium prices for software stability simplicity better ray tracing dlss and also work related features outside of gaming But for some other people 'hardware' price performance for gaming is the most important thing for them Again it's personal preference
Neither am I I didn't even mean it with any ill intent either I said almost exactly what you said word for word and people were being toxic It's weird it was probably all the salty 4090 owners that cant accept they bought a bad product
4090 IQ
No they will soon according to jayztwocents lawyers are already filling out paperwork for class action lawsuits and with it being fire related nvidia really won t have a hope in hell
I m glad I picked up a Asus Noctua 3080 a while back I ll be waiting for the next gen cards to upgrade
Nah I wanna use it
Seems to me a good fix to this is putting a heavy locking mechanism on the connector so it stays in place That way if the end user doesn't hear an audible Click after the connector is inserted they know they have a problem
I m upgrading any time past 2027 I built my rig to last 10 years or more since 2017 I keep going till the GPU dies which is not optimal I should have a new one before the GPU dies I can upgrade now if I want to But I know AMD will drop new GPU so their older hardware gets the discount
You could easily do 1440
I mean a 3090 is a super high end card so why wouldn't you be happy lol People mainly get a 4090 to show off and follow a trend
What do we say to the god of death
Can I ask why you've settled on only 500 memory for gaming I'm seeing most OC for VRAM being around 1000 on the low end and 2000 for golden chips Are you seeing any issues above 500
OPs card is literally the founders edition that retails for 1600 skuId 6521430 addchv true
What if they leave it folding Many ppl do
How can you tell
Well apparently not Gamers Nexus tested using only two pins and it was able to pass 600W without heating up that much The issue seems to be not plugging in fully or damage faulty plugs Still makes little sense why they made it so tiny though means its easier to damage Seems disconnecting the power connector periodically when cleaning your GPU is no longer a good idea which is dumb
It was through chat initially Then through email afterwards
Yes I know you can run it using only 3 But it's silly not to use 4 when you can spread the load across more connectors even at stock Especially when your PSU has
I went for 4 just because I could and spreading the load across 4 connections instead of 3 seemed good from a just in case perspective I'm sure the rog Thor could easily do 2 connections for 600w as well but until I have a native 12vhpwr psu seems like the more connections the better with my current setup
Ya I think the idea that 1x 8pin only can do 150w is based on the lowest common denominator of PSU cables My moddiy cable only came with 3x 8 pin on the psu side and they claim that's fine But I'm also running an EVGA P2 1600 my system only seems to pull 850 from the wall under most scenarios but it went on sale for like 200 a few months ago and I was able to sell my 1000w for 100 so meh
This guy even went to 50 Amp The 50 amps isn't some extreme testing situation number That's what the 4090 pulls when its been allowed to hit the 133 600watt power target at 12v w v a The 4090 can only pull at 12v so it is gonna hit 50amps at least in spikes under normal usage And again that's an absolutely horrifying amount of current for such a small connector Just look at a car jumper cable rated at 200amps also a 12v situation coincidentally It's GIANT With huge alligator clamps Then look at the dinky little atx 12v connector its WAY smaller than 1 4 of a jumper cable Just another giggle test that isn't funny This connector standard needs to be rev'd replaced out of existence quickly
okay I will
For US consumers take into account that NVIDIA Legally CAN NOT void your warranty for using a third party part NVIDIA would have to prove in court that the non oem part was the cause of the failure This is covered under the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act E2 80 93Moss Warranty Act Requirements Warrantors cannot require that only branded parts be used with the product in order to retain the warranty 7 This is commonly referred to as the tie in sales provisions 8 and is frequently mentioned in the context of third party computer parts such as memory and hard drives If NVIDIA does this see this page from the FTC resolving The FTC Can and will go after companies that do this as it is Illegal You may be able to take nvidia to small claims to get the cost reimbursed Not an expert on this part but I have read accounts of people doing this Just be aware that NVIDA if they choose can force a case out of small claims into regular court FYI I am not a lawyer This is not legal advice
I just chatted with Nvidia and their customer service rep confirmed the exact same thing I sent a screenshot and the pdf chat transcript to the email listed here
Update please
may void warranty It's BS to maybe weasel out of their warranty in the future but won't hold up
Please send in the damaged Nvidia cable as well as your card for your RMA pretty simple
Their claims are basically irrelevant anyway under US law They would have to show that use of an inferior 3rd party cable caused the damage in order to deny the warranty Using a third party cable can't void the warranty unless they can show that it was a substandard part that caused the damage
Ya that is why I am just kind of sick of it I posted my conversation asking Nvidia customer support directly about Cablemod cables where they said they told me they do not recommend using them But mods deleted it pretty fast So I am going to upload the jayztwocents video about this and see if they delete it too
Thats because nvidia is just rolling the dice on any class action lawsuit really hurting them Shitty big corporations tactics If the lawsuit proves its the cable and not the cards themselves it will likely not cost nvidia that much But then again im not a lawyer and law is complicated
u made me face with tears of joy
so far there is no known case that NVIDIA refuses warranty because CableMod has been used and we have been doing cables for their GPUs for almost a decade now nothing changed
From my understanding the Magnuson Moss Warranty act has nothing to do with this and Nvidia supplies the proper adapter If they did not supply the adapter then that is different Now how will Cablemod offer warranty for a RTX 4090 if they can't prove that it was the cable that killed it or caused burning or melting of the connector Will they still cover the warranty regardless I am sorry if I am very suspect It is just many companies will say this and then you will be thrown between two companies who say neither of them are responsible for your damage
Can I ask where cablemod said this
They actually came back in stock on November 8th mine will arrive this week
I have one on my desk Shop around
Weird it was super easy to plug it in on my pny 4090 easier than any 6 2 pin I've ever used
Then had it horizontally unseated slightly and it went to the same temp in 20 mins i cannot find the reference for this i'm aware of the 1200W test and this is the only one reported and its not logical and wont ever happen where did you read the horizontal thingy Also GN beat the hell out of the cable it sustained alot of abusing and also tested lose connection they couldn't get it to overheat nor melt so what are you talking about yes they said they will keep testing and publish the results later on but their initial tests for 3 4 continuous days yielded for nothing wrong here is the tweet for the 1200W Hassan Mujtaba on Twitter Loose connection testing by GALAX with a 12VHPWR connector Loose connection 100C Good connecttion 60 70C That's while the connector is pulling a sustained 1530W load There's more here and it is possible that bending is not the main issue here force contact is Twitter
I've had 3 AMD GPU's 2 out of the 3 both were unstable with display driver stopped responding crashes Never resolved the issues with the two just years of tinkering with clock speeds voltage settings trying to stop BSOD's Still using one of them to this day a vega 64 I blame AMD and their drivers not the hardware itself Although one thing I will admit I never tried is taking the GPU apart and redoing it' thermal paste Which admittedly might resolve the issues
The rma rate is very low due to this issue I'm not implying it's a non issue but all PC parts fail at a certain rate I had a corsair mp600 pro m2 drive fail after 12 months couldn't believe it also had a ryzen 2600 cpu which was dead on arrival I remember reading that the 5700xt had a 2 rma rate as a 4090 owner I am not concerned at all Over 4 weeks of ownership and going strong If it fails I'll get a replacement
Exactly While I'm not saying that it isn't an issue if you went by the talk on here you'd think it was happening at an alarming rate In reality this happens to 0 02 0 04 of users Over 100 000 4090's have been sold and we only have around 20 verified cases of the adapter issues If we just go ahead and double that rate to account for people who haven't posted on Reddit that number lands at 40 40 out of 100 000 is 0 04 That's an incredibly small amount of users facing these issues The failure rate of an AIO is 1 for example over double that rate and that's incredibly rare
Shhh you're disrupting the circlejerk
It's a small percentage now but they just launched there's a thing called time that tends to bring about unexpected evolving situations
I m amazed by how often I see this argument presented in this sub Obviously not every 4090 is melting cables and nobody ever claimed that The claim is that burning a power cable should not be an acceptable failure mode for any graphics card ever let alone one that costs 1600 If you already own a 4090 then good luck to you but I don t see how the not every 4090 argument is anything other than a cope
100k sold No freaking way You may be citing this article but read carefully this doesn't correspond with cards sold or even cards produced more like the of GPU dies generated so far I'd reckon the of cards produced and sold is far far lower text Since 20the 20NVIDIA 20GeForce 2C 20RTX of 20GPUs 20made 20or 20sold text Since 20the 20NVIDIA 20GeForce 2C 20RTX of 20GPUs 20made 20or 20sold
alternatively these cards haven't been available for very long leaving very little time for failures to occur
Higher quality specs man shrugging
How can you void the warranty if nvidia isn t aware of what cable you used It s not like they re tracking you
I asked Cablemod about this and they wouldn't give me a straight answer u CableMod
What if you had an Asus ATX 3 0 PSU and used the cable that came with that It wouldn't be the adapter that came with the card but would still be an official Asus product
That's there but in the wild we can stay silent here in the public on reddit everyone bashes Which is why the unlaunched 12gb 4080
Found it Thanks Nightmare fuel for me as I'm on a founders edition 4090 that is passed the return period and just installed the MEG1300 yesterday Let's see what happens Maybe I'll be next on the list of burned cables lol
In theory it shouldn t burn when idling little comfort that that is

Every day I see new posts about this issue just from these users on this Reddit alone These aren't rare isolated incidents this is a common issue and a serious one that should have been addressed weeks ago Stop downplaying it with unsourced statistics that you guessed and let this be what it is a PR nightmare for nVidia that they need to pay for
True thank you for pointing that out Still means it's the same root problem Add resistance to reduce current through the circuit or increase the capacity of the circuit
50amps x 12 volt 600 watts so not really 50 60 more like 48 52 anyway that's spread over 6 pins for roughly 8 9 amps on each which is below the amount the pins can handle if they went with the 8 pins they would have to do 4x 8pin because the requirement for 8 pins is only to be able to handle 150watt They could do 2x 12 pin though
Using made up numbers for ease of conveying the 's say a million aib cards were sold and ten thousand FE cards were sold If they both have a failure rate of 1 1000 we'd see 10 FE failures and 1000 AIB failures on despite having identical failure rates Now imagine the failure rate for the FE was 1 100 in the same scenario an order of magnitude higher We would see 100 failed FE cards and 1000 failed aib models leading some people to believe the AIB models are worse despite having a much lower failure rate I'm not saying anything like that is the case here it's just 're looking at occurences in a segmented population people may view the total cases as the defining factor Not the rate of occurences between the segments
But the adapters don't seem to be the issue People are burning adapters and direct cables
People are blaming the manufacturers is the point I'm making
Reddit users are uhm smiling face with tearsmiling face with tearsmiling face with tear
Yeah but jay says a lot of stuff that doesn't end up being true
I don't see this as a possibility When you install the driver package part of the license agreement binds you to arbitration
People mainly get a 4090 to show off and follow a trend You probably thought the same thing about 3090 owners a year ago
Or they have an actual need for that level of performance Some people do push their systems and would like even more horsepower
Not today
You're very welcome
The dude you're responding to is just a troll based on his account but in it wasn't plugged in correctly bullshit even when affected people are straight up saying they did everything they possibly could to ensure a secure connection because they knew of the issue in 't seen as many issues with those in almost 20 years as we have with these 12VHPWR adapters in just less than a month's time Seriously all those it must be user error people are complete idiots If the design of the adapter is such that it would leave the consumer absolutely zero margin for error with multiple possible points of failure just from plugging in the goddamn thing then the design of the adapter is stupid period
its literally all the way
Same situation as me then I guess by opening chat and saying look my connector melted Fix this they probably were quicker to rush a resolution For me with what I believe to be a defective card crashes under light loads and when watching videos in Chrome they're giving me the run around and making me jump through a million hoops to test things and they take days to get back to me It's such a pain I feel like they're trying to brush it under the rug and ignore my problem I almost wish my adapter would melt like yours just so I can get that expedited solution Speaking of which What are you going to do with the new card You going to try again and put it back in
It still shouldn't matter at the connector site The current is flowing into the bar that's spread across the entire connection
Good to know I will try 4 cables next time I think it s sillier for NVIDIA to not put that in their instructions I just assumed it was optional and 3 cables would be able to handle and balance the load accordingly
It's not spreading the load on the side that's the problem AFAIK all burns have been on the GPU side not PSU This means the issue is always at the 12 pin side so 3 vs 4 connectors shouldn't make a difference
How has the 4x8 to 12vhpwr cablemod been I've also ordered one since it appears to have not had a single reported instance so far
if the manual says it's extra then it's in no way useful period there is no other way to spin it and it's not even related to melting in any way
Sounds sensible I was reading closely what Corsair were doing and it was their PSU so I felt Corsair recommended 1 extra to make 3 was good enough and cablemod also agreed it could do 600w
I've got one of those moddiy 3x8pin to 16 pin psu cables coming How has yours been and how long have you been gaming with it
Corsair confirmed that quite a few of their PSU were designed to put 300w from one 8pin outlet on their PSU I am sure there is a list At the time I was checking for my HX1000 but like you I decided to add in redundancy and picked up a heavier unit at HX1500i
FYI as of now nobody has sent an email regarding this
give us some time to talk to NVIDIA will make an announcement on r NVIDIA
here is the UPDATE we talked to NVIDIA and they will talk to their support staff to change the messaging in a few days the support answer should NOT be anymore that our cables void the warranty
Time to grab a lighter
Ironically it could technically be a substandard part that caused the damage while not being any better than their own adapter They're both bad
Msi customer support for the Suprim 4090 is the same thing My questions was is this happens will it be under warrenty Their response was dancing around the question not giving a direct answer You can bend to a 90 degree angle Don't fold the cable in half will damage connectors using factory parts it shouldn't melt do not use other cable mods as if damage happens it will void warrenty As long as the cable is not bent you should be fine if the cable were to melt you will need to send the card and cable back as stated if the cable is not bent it should not melt or cause damage to your rig My opinion is they are just going to blame cable being bent Which cable comes bent in the box from a MSI PSU with the native connector with a twist 't cause damage What is your input on this Do you think it's a connector issue resistance issue pinn issue voltage issue
If it were the case that you had to used the supplied produces then care companies could void your warranty for having your tires changed Because you're not using their supplied tires The Tie Clause forbids this sort of thing The only way they could get around this is if instead of focusing on you using a third party produce would be to say you didn't have the cables professionally installed but I don't think that's a can of worms they want to open because then technically anyone installing an Nvidia GPU themselves could potentially void their warranty
In comments on this subreddit They've said it multiple times I don't have an exact thread to refer to atm But I'm sure you could ask someone like CableMod Matt He'd probably explain all the details
I was checking everyday but no luck enraged face
It's the plugs I'm telling you teclab recreated 110c Temps in 20mins with unseated connectors
's not completely plugged in it moves slightly horizontal I think it's this issue causing the heat buy a QC problem with the cables making it hard for people to plug in more than they already can They can see the sense pins still and a border around the plug but they can't push anymore and they just think its fine So yes it's a cable problem wether the cable quality is recreating the same issue involved as if it wasn't seated correctly Both can be true at once
Wait so you think 110c isn't enough to melt Just because gamers nexus can't do it doesn't mean it's debunked This guy is the only guy to show melting Temps on the connector so until he gets proven wrong idk bruh it's all we got that's the leading theory then corroborated by Johnny guru
Hmm I see Any of the 3 were new gpus I m debating to go for the 7900 xtx Also we re you overclocking them And we re you only using them for gaming
AMD drivers and software have been solid for the past few years now Just FYI
Wow finally a reasonable comment
It'd be really bad if almost all of the adapters are faulty and will melt just a matter of how long it takes
If it s a problem inherent to all 4090s then yeah we d probably see it get worse over time But if it s a problem that only affects a small percentage of 4090s that have some specific defect we probably wouldn t I don t think there s enough info to say The fact that reviewers are intentionally creating poor connections to the cards etc and still failing to reproduce the issue would support the 2nd scenario though don t you think
Obviously not every 4090 is melting cables and nobody ever claimed that Dude plenty of people are going around saying or implying that
I m responding to someone who is saying yet people keep buying 4090s Implying that nobody should be buying 4090s because of this
You think there is less than 100k in the whole world I didn t realized I bought such a rare product
More like getting some money from people too rich to wait for a problem resolution while selling snake oil We didn't have a case with FE cards for a month because those cards are rare cablemod cables are even more rare so chances are we won't see them burning for quite some time
Well it would be hard to give straight answers about other manufacturers' warranties What we can say is that we never saw an instance of refused warranty for having used our cables and also that we work closely with Asus they promote our cables by including CableMod discount codes in their PSUs so it wouldn't make sense to refuse warranty for having used them
If you think a small portion of vocal Reddit users swayed a multi billion dollar corporation to do anything you're delusional lol
Ok so by that logic isnt one 30min stress test enough to know if you ll have any issues Or like running all the 3d mark benchmarks one after the other
Ah sorry only the comment with the question mark showed up so I didn't see the one with all the info It's expected to ship in 1 2 weeks Sorry about the long wait of course full kits take a longer time to process as we're making everything to order
Yes We just have to update the naming and add 4090 as well
you are right your unsources statistics of ''100 are failing'' is much better s Not sure what you are arguing I never said it was not a serious issue I just find it dumb to read shit like ''that card will also burn'' like it is a problem that will literally kill 100 of the cards
If it's below what the pins can handle they wouldn't burn If it was engineered correctly this wouldn't be an issue I seriously doubt it's because of a mm of the plug being not fully seated It really doesn't matter to me personally I didn't waist money on a 4090 If 1 mm can cause that much heat there would have been a bunch more 3090s burning since they both use the 12pin connector
Do we have any actual numbers for FE's vs AIBs Otherwise this is all wild speculation
Some also seem to think people are overreacting to expensive cards melting power connectors due to Nvidia design flaws
In my country any contract that writes the parties out of litigation is deemed invalid How do you expect to uphold a contract private law between two or more parties without the weight of the legal system If the contract said you must seek arbitration first then perhaps that could be legal but to bind you to arbitration Lol no chance in hell that would survive in court here
Just what jay said with there being fire potential to a consumer product nvidia is responsible
i'll send it back if theres a future recall of course
Not rlly but most people don't need a card that powerful for 1440p or 4k I saw someone who had a 4090 with a 1080p 144hz monitor Like it's just pointless
That's why I said most my statement is still true
I would just keep trying them They even escalated it to overnight shipping after initially giving me a 3 day shipping label I wont use the card until I hear an explanation and a resolution from NVIDIA
That is what I was thinking The 4th cable is only for the additional 33 power otherwise load should still be balanced between the 3 cables
I don't think Nvidia has made any recommendations More connections better is my logic and I'm just some non electrician posting on Reddit Hope they send you a new card promptly
So far so good Been using it since Oct 31sr so almost 2 weeks I didn't notice a click when inserting it for the first time which made me nervous Replugged without the cable shroud yesterday and heard an audible click Gave the cable and card connectors a good visual inspection while it was unplugged and everything was looking good Looks way better than that awful stock adapter too
Mine has been good I got the premium silver wire which i don't think I'd do again it's the wrong aesthetic but otherwise it's good I've been gaming about a week
Email is resent It was rejected the first time I sent it Do you want video footage of the live conversation I probably be using it for a youtube video
Are you confident that you shipped enough cables that if there was possibility for your cable to melt we would have seen it already
Exactly Just burn it But I mean honestly if the 4090 s are burning it shouldn t matter what cable was in it They need to make it right
I think everyone is waiting right now to see to what conclusion NVIDIA comes regarding the root cause of the issue
Okay I will keep this as a memo This is a very good point At least I have something if I ever come across warranty issues In the past I have had MSI issues with warranty on a RX 480 that burned claiming it was the PSU that was faulty and going back and forth and my Antec PSU didn't have warranty outside of the warranty range I would just hate to go through that again and no I never got that GPU warrantied in the end
But did it melt Galax pulled 1200W through the connector in a lab hit 100C but didn't melt Pretty sure the connector is made of nylon PA16 or PA66 which should handle between 170 250C It may be the connector somehow but I don't believe it's user error otherwise we would see so many more graphics cards over the years burn up and we still have people on here saying they plugged it in fully and still burned
Thanks for the vid its non english thats why i couldnt find it however i noticed that he is measuring temps using thermal camera im no expert in this but Buildzoid said its useless to measure the temps this way as the plastic is a good insulator and you are not actually measuring the pins terminals temps rather than the plastic itself however i'm not sure if its the cables or not in my personal opinion i believe it has something more than that maybe cables quality bending and non fully seated make it alot worse but the fact that no one could ever get it to melt until now except this guy puts a big question mark on the issue it should have been easily reproduceable if its just the cable adapter with bending and non fully seated dont you think
no not that please read my comment above last paragraph
yeah I've never bought a used GPU My Vega 64 I currently have I have is loud hot unstable when with any clock volt settings works 99 of the time but could will crash from time to time still I've tried varius combininations of underclock overvolt undervolt overclock power level It's 100 anecdotle but until I have issues with nvidia card I will avoid Nvidia forever I was stuck with them too because I bought my 27xl30z benq monitor for 500 to go with my GPU too so if I wanted freesync to work I had to stick with it and I despise screen tearing
I didn't say all 4090 it's not a matter of it being a small percentage or all of them There's a massive gap in between those extremes Maybe some cables take months before they start melting
Less than 100K completed cards in the world so far yeah Not that hard to believe There will be more when Nvidia is done offloading their Ampere products
No snake oil at all we use different seamed terminals crimp instead of solder and some are using 18 AWG while we use 16 AWG All of our cables are also tested and retested prior to shipping
You re just salty you can t afford a 4090 man shrugging
The cable quality was still part of the issue Chances are higher with lower quality cables even if it s possible to happen on any cable Tho like most things it seems to come down to human error being the biggest fault as to why they fail
Yup so just take a lighter to their cable and send that One would hope the cablemod cable won t melt tho keeping you from needing to RMA in the first place
It wasn't just reddit it was the whole social media Twitter YouTube etc Which called it a disguised 4070
I wouldn't say so no this seems to be something that can happen during prolonged sessions where the connector slowly heats up to the point of melting So a 30 minute stress test wouldn't be enough to prove your connector is OK Although I wouldn't want to say it can't happen in a short period of time either My point was that at idle the card draws 15W which isn't going to melt cause a fire so leaving your PC unattended at idle shouldn't be a problem But leaving it unattended with a game left open drawing 300W is probably a bad idea
Can I get another update on this nothing has changed
I never said or even remotely implied this issue occurs at a rate of 100 I said it's a common problem My argument is simple The frequency of which this issue occurs absolutely warrants consumer apprehension Your previous comment does not align with but rather ridicules this sentiment You're downplaying people's deserved apprehension as being unreasonable It's not unreasonable to not want to damage a piece of computer hardware that costs more than my whole PC monitors included
the 3000 series used a 12 pin connector that can only put out 300 watts instead of 450 600 for the 4090 16 pin both do it over 6 hot pins so the 3000 series was only looking at 4 amps per pin you also seem to be vastly underestimating how much heat is produced when electricity arcs between 2 objects if you don't think a mm of air makes a difference
I was using the situation at hand as an easy vehicle to explain the concept of Base Rate N Using made up or the very clear sign something isn't factual Imagine
It's an example
It only takes one case of housing burning down caused by melting 4090 to get Nivida recalling the card
A lot of Nvidia fans are like for the MOTHERLAND when it comes to acknowledging Nvidia's mistakes
Right but that would mean consumer protection agencies could get involved and force a recall But a class action lawsuit is not possible if all the plaintiffs are bound to arbitration You'd need a judge to invalidate the arbitration agreement which is not likely to happen
4k needs a 4090 for 100 fps for the more demanding titles
No it's not you're just making random assumptions
Well their instructions did say to connect at least 3 cables And yes they sent me a replacement 4090 after 3 days
Nice thanks I have a feeling I should probably remove the shroud when I get it since I also have an FE on the way
no need what you sent is good enough and we are already in touch with NVIDIA thanks for your help and stay tuned
honestly speaking we are fully prepared that we will see a melting cable from us here and there just like we did for other gpu generations as it is the nature of things however we are fully prepared to help our customers then and replace broken hardware in worst case just like we did in the past
Can you please post a link for the appropriate cable adapter Thank you
110 in 20mins and said its now runaway voltage leak meaning it'll keep climbing So someone gaming for a fucking hour what you thinks gonna happen Yeah funny you mention that why don't you Google 8pin pcie burnt All of a sudden you see tons of them and people saying you didn't plug it in all the way lmmmmfao
If the plastics an insulator that means it's hotter on the inside so he's even more right Yeah you will see gamers nexus trying peoples burnt cables and he's prolly gonna get them to work on cards because he will plug them in all the way lol As much as you wanna see someone burn it the point stands as he works for a card maker that 110c is too hot regardless if it melts Other than that he's the only one who recorded high Temps period and now Johnny guru says the only way to get Temps like that is the same way he did Johnny ripped off multiple wires from the solder point and it still didn't get to 80c Because it was plugged in all the way Voltage dropped instantly when it was unseated creating a leak and then the hear rose I understand we all wanna know exactly but I think nvidia having a non idiot proof connector with the QC issues and the fact people are trying to jam these and bend these cables in way too small of cases is a problem I have a 7000D and my tuf oc with a native atx 3 0 cable is just barely touching the glass still lol that's with a completely not stressed bend at 35mm
Thanks for the insight Also by new gpus I meant newer models What were the other 2 you had problems with if you don t mind me asking
I'm confused freesync is open source Nvidia GPUs work with freesync
All your anecdotes over 5 years old
Thank you it s better to come from your mouth than mine I know your cables are high quality
Seeing the GamersNexus video I think I was actually right
Oh Are you sure it just wasn't a very select few Techtubers and such Because I didn't see anything about it aside from a very specific set of hardware reviewers lol
Please reach out to our support to know more about the status of your order sorry again about the wait
''I never said or even remotely implied this issue occurs at a rate of 100 '' You implied it by replying to me when I was replying to someone who clearly implied that I dont care about your argument you are the one answering to mine '' Your previous comment does not align with but rather ridicules this sentiment '' It ridicules the statement ''that card will also burn'' which implies every single cards are burning up ''You're downplaying people's deserved apprehension as being unreasonable '' Going around saying every single card is burning is what's being unreasonable Connectors melting is a serious issue and it is being investigated Nothing we can do If you want to sue nvidia be my guest I dont care
There shouldn't be any air gap at all if there is only a 1mm seating gap The pins should touch completely except for 1mm of the pin not being in the slot Also your assumption that it's only 48 to 52 amps is wrong because the card is not 100 efficient 85 at best which is over 60 amps That's too much hench the burned plastic Not trying to argue with anyone over something like this
He s upset because he owns the card in question and has turned off all logical processing and critical thinking because he feels personally attacked by an example
Totally get it every bit of this is speculation at this point
That's kind of the problem It's going to be next to impossible for this to start an open flame fire so they'll continue to delay remain silent and avoid a full recall If it was actually catching on fire they would have already been forced to pull it from market and recall everything but it's not
What they should recall if they don't know the cause the old 8pin melted too and it wasn't so rare so AMD and NVIDIA should recall any GPU made in the last 10 years
i understand what your saying and i get it but once someone gets hurt from a consumer product that agreement is out of the window i highly think governments will force a recall canada already has reports on it
Name a few and what settings
I'm not tho lol stay mad
How did you get in contact with Nvidia Email or phone call
Did the replacement card or adapter look any different at all
Congrats on the FE
Thank you Cablemod I think after you intervened I got this email in response and it is awesome It also helps clarify some of the warranty rules 100 Hello XXX Thank you for contacting NVIDIA Customer Care This is a follow up email in reference to your contact to NVIDIA regarding Warranty query for using 3rd party power cables with RTX 4090 FE I checked with my manager regarding this yes you can use any Third party power cables with our RTX 4090 FE since this is not considered as Modification There will not be any compromise with our warranty for using any Third party Cables dongles connectors No Problem Let me know if this helps or if you need further assistance on this Looking forward for your update Best regards You guys are amazing with your customer support Honestly above and beyond And great content for my amateur video You guys really do deserve AAA for customer interaction Thank you so much
So if nvidia refuses warranty cablemods got me My cable arrives any day now I really want to close my case However if the only way I ll get a replacement should anything melt is by having the original cable be the one that caused it Then I ll have to leave the case open and the original cable in
You do you buddy I'm going to wait for someone with conclusive evidence instead of jumping on the next big hypothesis stating it's fact
It was at 1 other that I had problems with I have had 3 AMD gpu's 1 of them worked great which was the 'll reply when I can remember the card I had before the twin frozr that also was trouble
not in 2017 Freesync monitors were about 100 cheaper than Gsync back then which is one of the main reasons I had gone AMD over Nvidia back then 5 years ago
Very welcome
No they couldn t it s their video card that caused the cable to melt not the other way around
As I said in my second statement what about all the 3rd party PSU cables that are also in use they can t all void the warranty as well
Don't know in detail who said this but a lot of posts memes were enough to unlaunch the disguised 4070
My EVGA 980 literally started a fire in my case I RMAed it but no recall ensued
That agreement is NOT out the window in fact that's precisely why it's there to begin with It's a legal contract and can't just be dissolved without due process Contracts don't just magically become invalidated when there's fire involved A government agency forcing a recall is one option that would not break the agreement
Most games that's aren't on a 4090 can't reach a stable 100
I have a 30 series but okay And yes you're making random assumptions there MIGHT be some that only bought 4090's to flex as there probably are but saying that most people did is an assumption based on nothing unless you can provide us with some facts and numbers Or maybe just some general questionnaire How do you know that most people that bought it didn't buy it for data science or for video processing or 3d designing or whatever
Chat via their website then through emails
Both still looked the same
Thanks for the nice feedback 3
If our cables melts and NVIDIA refuses the warranty then we will replace your card
Just take your 4090 back then because nvidia won't tell you a god damn thing lol I've been quite enjoying my time with my card But ah yes someone who works at an AIB and Johnny guru the head of R D at corsair PSU division vs some random fucking person on reddit Can't wait till gamer nexus says don't use a shitty cable that doesn't let you plug it in all the way lol then maybe people will stop worrying because it has to be him who says it to be fact apparently Not two individuals who have way more testing equipment then he does
Ah gotcha
lol Nvidia doesn't care what a few people on Reddit or Youtube think friend C'mon
LOL I wish I could get 35mm of distance
Lol the average PC builder can't even get fan orientation right and they expect that people take all of these precautions that may or may not work
They expect everyone to run a case with no HDD bays lmao
35mm distance with a big ass 4090 I guess i'm building my PC inside a wardrobe
If they want 35mm to be straight they should probably manufacture the cables with a rigid constraint that makes it formal No sense creating a flexible cable if it s intended use is being inflexible That s something that can be implemented and prevent misuse sensibly at manufacture It should probably also be communicated by every vendor because this isn t something anyone has done before when building pcs lol
U GPU side of the connector not the PSU side In fact they didn't even show the GPU side connector at all Whoever made these memes messed up I think
The plug shouldn t be able to be inserted at an angle if it was engineered properly Seems standard fare to blame the customer on this one to make up for a shitty design
Except we already established that those aren't the issues with the cables As there are people who followed through with this and had melting cables Companies will do literally anything but accept blame Also fuck msi
35mm I only have 24 smiling face with tear
So we're really going with the you're holding it wrong angle MSI Gonna call it user error when it takes so little to potentially burn up a very expensive part
Is this real They made memes out of tech problems I would get it if the problem wasn't serious but this problem is ruining cards
lmao fuck msi
they can put my 35mm cord in their receptacle in a parallel orientation
Bunch of clowns
This is some bullshit MSI
35mm without a bend Then make the damn cable fitting 35mm long These companies will do anything and everything before admitting they mess up
Turns out that MSI was correct but people here shitted on em lmao Shame
Hahahahaha what a load of shit I'll skip this gen
Nice to see we re at the acknowledge the problem but blame the victims stage of the 4090 trash tier cable debacle FFS
Wow Really trying to get in with the cool kids with this one An aging fraudulent predatory scamming company attempting to make light of a shitty situation Original MSI can suck my farts
OK first one I got that Why should I care about the second and third one It s totally design flaw
Lmao wtf MSI being assholes like usual
ya because all the issues have been related to the PSU end not the GPU
I don't like this idea of pushing the responsibility onto the consumer for what is clearly a potential fire hazard
Looks like MSi was right people expect accountability from brands but have none for themselves
Honestly if a connector is this finnicky and can cause catastrophic failure it is bad design
D not on the PSU side
Msi is pathetic
At least there are no reported CableMod cables being melted Let's hope it stays that way
35mm of distance from the connector I have a decent sized case and I think I'd struggle to have 35mm between the edge of the card and the wall of the damn room if I had a 4090
I see that this is why EVGA left they don t wanna put up with something like this
still trying to blame the user this is how companies cop out of paying for replacements Not a good look MSI
I d suspect they don t show the GPU side because they don t warranty the GPU unless MSI brand so it s easiest to leave that off It s almost impossible for them to impose a new dimension like that on consumers and expect to still be an option I don t want a full tower but I have no idea which cases allow for this clearance
POV shit
Go through the Reddit megathread 12VHPWR burn list Don't want to point a specific users but there are literally pictures of users not plugging it all the way in Although not stupid proof but I do think coloring the inner section of the connector will prevent this happening If you can see the color then its not fully inserted
Glad to own no MSI products right now
He even heard a click sound which confirms that the connector is plugged in firmly
Just fucking accept that the cables are flawed
Thanks for solidifying my decision to never purchase another MSI product
The fuck so it s user error No manufacturing defects
I m still waiting on evga or sea sonic gen 5 psu
I bought a msi x370 board brand new when x470 came out Had so many problems with it that when it died within the year I had it I didn't even bother rmaing it Glad I went with ASUS after it
I feel like cases are not ready for this requirement lol
lol 35mm of distance This is a joke Instead they could and should recommend cases that can fit that 35mm of distance
Cringe
full insertion yep good info or maybe make connector easier to fully insert 35mm of free space says where on the spec that's just mythical reasoning it's like saying we don't have confidence in our product quality standard so we hope you take precaution just in case
It has to go ALL in
At this point they're just taking the piss
how is this related to 4090 they're just showing some psu pics
IMO the placement of the connector on the card is trash it should be at an angle like 30X0 series or in front of the card instead of the side
God I hate MSi
Free mallet now included
These companies need to be forced into a recall This is absurd This is the worst case of ignoring fires caused by a product in a long time
Yeah I don t have anywhere near 35mm between the connector and my side panel Cases just aren t that wide
Who seriously would be so reckless to plug in the power connector canted loose like this The whole 3 5cm clearance is laughable MSI is clearly trolling 4090 owners
Or they could just use the regular connectors which were fine
Wow When it turns out that Chernobyl connectors are in fact down to a design flaw MSI are going to end up looking like assholes
That's just poor design period
Seems very condescending
Making fun of a design fail were companies are basically tossing the ball about who's guilty here even trying to blame the end user is definitely the way to go MSI
Or just buy AMD 7900xtx since you don't have to worry about anything and is going to run comparable to a 4090 for much cheaper and much less power I don't understand people that want to cling to nvidia for this specific generation of cards Is it not just a no brainer You wouldn't even be able to notice the difference in performance between the 2 cards Isn't it at most 10 in the current theory
If manufacturers don't want people to bend the cable then don't make it bendable At the end of the day it is clearly a design flaw
Yes MSI the users are to blame not the shit 16 pin 12VHPWR power connector Thanks for reminding me never to buy anything you make
ahahahahahahha how to justify a 2000 scam by telling how t4rd the customer is for not inserting the cable 7900XTX 999
This is the most unprofessional response i have ever seen Even Apple didn't do anything like that
This is one of a few reasons I'm eyeing the 7900XTX this generation I love me some Nvidia but I don't trust that cable and AMD seems to be going the route of multiple 8 pin connectors
Excuses Excuses for purely and flawed designed connector now when they found out they are properly banged in te A let's push it on the consumer such a BS
I loooove when companies try to blame the consumer for their terrible design Reminds me of Apple with the antenna issue
This is just repeating what some have speculated not official Nvidia info Only the Nvidia s investigation report will be useful imo 't possible be good in between the melting connector and the 7900XTX
This is like when Steve Jobs said you re holding it wrong
Thank you gurujohnny for misdirecting the issue and causing more problems
Are we really at a point where people do not know how to connect cables properly What regards
Even if you do all these things it can happen to you People should just not get the 4090 Or only get it in the pretense of having it recalled still as stupid thing to do imo
Tech Illiterates should stick to consoles Imagine claiming to build PCs and not even be able to plug in a fkn cable fully LMAO Y'all better not even water block anything
There are report of people not using the side panel and cable is running straight with no bent And still report of melting cable So yeah lol
Clearly they really understand the issue if they're focusing on the
They are subtley putting the onus on the end user which is BS What cases did Nvidia or MSI use to test the 4090 that allowed for 35mm I bet they never even came across melted cables because they rushed the 4090 out the door to appease share holders I'm Looking forward to a 7900 xt next month
That's what she said
Still a bad design 35mm of reserve length is absolutely ridiculous to expect of anyone
if i could buy a 1 800ish vga i wont be that sloppy They expect everyone that buy 4090 is that stupid eh
What the 35mm distance from the connector does
Man if only they can put this much effort into customer support Oh yea They do They blame the customer every chance they get
they are trying to say it endusers builders fault
having to do all this shit just so your pc doesnt catch fire is consumer blaming at its fucking worst its a shit connector if it can catch fire if you treat it like any other plug in your system
Major System Instability
r antimeme
Fully inserting totally feels good MR Lucky says not sus at all
Thank god I went with the view 71 for my case Had no issues so far with my 4090
What do they mean by 35 mm do they want us to use a separate power supply Can someone explain this to me
It appears Reddit has added MSI to the List of Hated Companies Honest question which pc component makers are still seen as respectable
Meanwhile the only AIB that had any sense to put the power connection on the card at the end is not making the cards anymore That and they were going to have one of the smaller cards Seriously Who thought making a smaller connector and running more power through it was going to be a good idea I don t care if I have to plug 4x 8 pin connectors into a card I would rather that than the obvious lack of consideration for case sizes that Nvidia and AIB have had with the 4090 and temperamental 12 pin connectors
Theyre right I also received similar documentation on the 4090 launch for my customers
Don t say it don t say it don t say it
Not buying this Saying it's user error is a diagnosis of exclusion A Multiple users who seemed to know what they're doing have sworn up and down the plug was fully inserted B Techtubers were not able to recreate this because if it's really improperly inserted it won't turn on
So basically MSI trying to be cute about saying it s your fault not ours
Oh I see So it's user error that's to blame then Got it
Yeah MSI needs to get better social media reps
I wish I could get fully inserted
this connector is ass a different connector type is needed
Native 12vhpwr connectors scare me Potentially 2 points of failure on each end man facepalming I don t think we ve seen any evidence of adapters failing on the PCI E connection
What the fuck kind of case can fit this 35MM STRAIGHT from a PSU shroud Are they nuts Have these people built computers before This is worse than the GPU side not fitting
Someone photoshop this like the scene from fight club
On my 3060ti in my meshify 2 my corsair cables literally cant even fit against the side panel unless i bend them The like dark thick rubber sleeving near the end of the cable doesnt bend at all so i HAVE to bend it closer to the connector What kind of nonsense is this If this is really an issue then every build I've ever seen or done has been wrong I dont understand it at all
How many cases have 35mm space from the fat card Maybe it's time to ditch the side panels
Their marketing is made to put blame on Gamers don't fall for it Still enough reports saying it was fully in We are paying 2X prices for these products make them fix this and stop blaming Gamers
They keep releasing pcie generations why cant they design the pcie slot to handle the power of modern day GPUs That way we can discard the added power connector and be done with these connector problems
This is bad taste coming from MSI
With how chonky the cards are people are barely fitting 4090's in cases nbsp For some reason MSI is marking how it should go into the PSU even though all the examples we have seen are on the GPU side lol
That third picture is of the PSU not the GPU
If only they did it like EVGA power connector
That's what she said
That s what my wife says
laughs in big tower
i got hard 50mm and it should fit but its still super tight down there
Have they seen the clusterfuck that comes out of the back of a PSU lol Even modular PSUs end up with a mess of spaghetti because modern cases usually have the PSU in its own smaller compartment Unless they are advocating for a second PSU for just the GPU
That's what she said
if you dont itll look like the top of the second pic and burn into the connector Time to get a bigger case
I wish I could get
Yeah how many PCI E connectors melted over the last 15 years The design of this new connector is flawed
To play devils advocate I would dare to say that most people that is buying the 4090 right now aren't average PC builders and more like PC enthusiasts
Plugging your cable all the way in is all these precautions If so then yeah we should expect people to take all those precautions
the average PC builder thats why 4090 is not for average PC builder You are paying 1600 for a premium product that require professional delicate handling Pretty much like many other luxury products cars watches phones they are make to require delicate handling from the
Precautions Like plugging in a cable all the way Be realistic
All of these precautions You mean plugging it in fully and straight
I don't even this consideration into account for these types of pins
While PC building really is almost trivial these days we shouldn't overlook that steps exist that aren't user friendly and require diligence following of procedure LGA sockets for example how often ppl are asking if a bent pin can be saved Or try to install TR4 sTRX4 without exactly following the manual and you'll wonder why there are missing memory channels God forbid if we ever get stuff like sockets 3647 in the consumer space Doesn't make ATX 3 0 any better but there is this miss conception in the builder space that its like building with Lego Bricks and nothing can go wrong I've seen enough ITX builds with cable bents that are so out of spec it isn't even funny anymore All the connectors and cables actually have quite strict restrictions on how to be used its just stuff is so overbuild no one cares Another thing is that everyone is searching for the one and only cause for the melts while in reality it will most likely be a mixture of different issues that leads to it can't insert cable damaged cable damaged connector user error so in that regard ATX 3 0 really is a shitty standard
I swear every time someone asks how to tell which way their fans point They even started adding little arrows for people too stupid to figure out how a fan functions
Yup atx 3 0 is doa
thats a THEM problem Being a tech illiterate means stick to consoles
Love this Everyone forgets even morons have money
Protip just plug in your modular cables before you screw in your psu In case of adding something in just take the psu loose and easily insert the cables You'll save a ton of time and sore knuckles I promise
people still use hdd i even removed the ssd and I'm running only m2 lol
Big towers and NVMe only baby partying face
I mean my last build that had a hard drive on it was in 2016 SSDs and M 2 are more common now and cheaper
Laughs in atx full case antec 1200v3
Also that's not 35mm that's bigger then
No the 35mm no bend is for both sides of the connector If you are running a ATX3 0 psu don't bend the cable close to the psu or the gpu The connector is the same at both ends why would the bending restriction only apply to the gpu
Bro it can only be angled if not inserted fully they are showing that a plug that is not fully inserted will make insufficient contact Name a plug that is 'engineered' against not being fully plugged in
Yep this seems to be in extremely poor taste and a clear inability to read the room
It's not about you or me or most people here it's about average Joe seeing it then laughing at the idiots who burn their gpu with not putting their cable entirely in and then rejoice and go buy their 4090 It's just marketing for the average Joe customer Just to very likely also end up with a burned cable It's really that way if you are here on this sub you are very likely not the target audience of this kind of marketing already Your way past than the average Joe already
Obligatory fuck MSI on every thread Shitty ass company
The leading theory by the two or three people who tested these plugs and not the armchair engineers here on Reddit who have probably never done any stringent testing of PC hardware in their life is in fact that it's user error with people not ensuring the cable is fully inserted MSI appears to have come to the same conclusion
we already established Who The leddit experts face with tears of joy
Curious what your thoughts are after gamers nexus video about this issue dropped showing that the issue really was largely people not plugging in the cable the entire way
Also fuck msi lmao completely agree
Seriously instead of making these bullshit memes how about getting competent engineers to design a connector that doesn t fucking suck
Hey man That's above average Too big even
Yeah it's not really realistic for most people to have that clearance in cases currently out Unless side mounting
then DO NOT PUT THE SIDE PANEL ON Are y'all crazy Wait for the good cable and dont put the side panel on
Not great not terrible
Considering how many tests show this problem is extremely rare even in unrealistically bad cases ie GN it doesn't take just a little You could crash a 50k ducati riding it off the dealership floor It takes a split second of a distraction or what would seem like a minor lapse in judgement So is it the motorcycle's fault you can't ride
The problem is affecting less than 0 1 of cards Buy one and enjoy In the 1 1000 chance you have a problem just rma and get a new card Think about it like this for every one person with a bad card 999 or more are enjoying a 4090
Generally speaking I don't see anything wrong with using memes to send the message out
So just the tip
Jesus H Christ you people are mad lol I thought this post was funny And I own a 4090 Gaming X Trio Y'all need to chill
You shouldn't and tests have been showing its probably unrelated anyways
The second one is also something you have to care about If you put that excessive strain on the cable it won't make proper contact or possibly damage the cable It's because of the mechanical leverage which amplifies any downward force This is true for any cable I take care of people's networks the number rj45 jacks I've seen that were excessively strained which caused one of the pins to unseat is non zero User then complains why they're getting 100Mbps instead of
this no excuses just shitty design avoid fire hazards
the issue is not plugging in the connector all the way in
The person had a Corsair 7000d case I have a 750d which is almost the same size You can not leave the side of the case on and not have the cable bend pretty severely Not mentioned in that article My cablemod 12vhpwr would barely fit with the side panel on even then it would be pressing against it Not blaming anyone the manufacturers should absolutely have included a 90 adapter with every card
Get this it is possible this person pushed it in all the way for the photo so their warranty claim is valid It's definitely what I would do but I wouldn't post it on Reddit and let media sites use it
There s literally a picture in the article showing the cable is not coming out straight and that s before the side panel is on
Glad to own a Suprim Liquid X that has been working perfectly for a couple weeks with both the included adapter and the cablemod cable Didn't have space in my case for a second 360 rad like the waterforce
Incredibly happy owner of an MSI 4090 here Thankfully I know how to check a cable is correctly plugged in so had zero issues
gotta say my x570 ace board is a beast went from an asus tuf x570 to this and its been night and day the asus was literal garbage
He didn't have a 35mm straight
I don't want to send you to panic but it could happen with any connector the 8pin is far from fail proof
It's not manufacturing defect Some youtubers could not reproduce the melting issue on their end I imagine nvidia is still not sure of the exact cause otherwise they would had made a statement already Most likely a design flaw
I have the Cablemod 12vhwpr to 4 pice cable and it's just as good I have a Evga 1300 G2 zero reason for me to buy another 300 psu when mine is working perfectly when a 50 cable is all that's needed for a clean and safe install
Based on your feeling all electrical engineer
Apple is hands down the best customer service company there is
Maybe after J Your holding wrong Have you ever created something great Eric List goes in Cook has more class but this is apples to oranges
As a very happy 4090 owner I personally wouldn't let a tiny number of problematic 4090s which seems likely due to user error impact your decision It should come down to one thing do you find the price for the very best GPU on the market reasonable I paid AU 3300 for mine and couldn't be happier It's an absolutely incredible GPU when paired with my 55 and 77 LG OLEDs Honestly the improvement over my 3090 is akin to the difference between my PS4 Pro and my PS5
You know that 8pin connectors melt too right try a simple search here on
It s the education system man
Tbf that s what I d say as well
It means you don't bend the cable close to the card and thus the plug doesn't tend to be angled inside the receptacle surface
The adapter is the ugliest bulkiest thing I have ever seen in my life I definitely need a 3rd party cable
Lian li o11 dynamic xl here definitely don't have as much space as they say but so far doing fine
Gigabyte 4090 fits in Corsair 4000x with MSI a100g 12vhpr native cable face holding back tearsOK hand light skin tone
Technically both the PSU side and GPU side matter for solid connection as it's all about solid contact on both sides of the cable ensuring a low resistance path less heat for the whole cable length with no drastic EM bottlenecks high resistance regions What's interesting to me is that some PSU manufacturers do the PSU side connection differently than others For the ASUS ROG THOR 1600W PCIE 5 0 compatible PSU the PSU side connector actually uses dual 8 pin slots 6 pins actually used and not the 12VHPWR connector MSI Afterburner shows me the ability to take the 4090 FE over 100 but for gaming on my 3 440 x 1 440 monitor I don't think that's even going to matter Plus going over that 100 limit is what allows higher current higher heat and higher likelihood of an issue occurring still fairly low unless there's a defect
They could burn on the gpu side from not being plugged in all the way on the psu side
MSI has had this picture in their manual for years
I dunno I only have 4 cables coming out of my psu 3 if I took away the rgb sata M 2 only for me
I have not tested a third party for 12VHPWR like cablemod yet but I can tell you that the adapter that came with my 4090 gigabyte was extremely hard to fully insert I plugged it in and then used a flashlight to check and saw it was NOT flush So I lifted the 'tab' that's on the connect itself put my case sideways and applied heavy force with one hand while holding the case with the other finally I heard the cable 'click' in aka the nvidia adapter can click in Then I checked again with the flashlight and saw it was flush x200B I was planning to never use the adapter and only cablemod so when my cablemod came I swapped the new GPU in only to find I was accidentally sent the wrong cablemod cable already contacted their support they are sending a replacement of the correct cable but yeah the amount of force required which has no mention anywhere in any of the guides included with the GPU is poor design If I didn't read on reddit beforehand I probably would've thought the cable was fully inserted
Well at least 11 in the past year or two prior to the release of the 4090 Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 Case 7 Case 8 Case 9 Case 10 Case 11 That's just what I found from a quick Reddit search Some are from GPU miners yes but not all of them
noOoOooOOOooOoooo its the user's fault its catching on fireEEeeEEE the connector is PERFECT WITH ZERO FLAWS if you follow a bunch of stupid rules msi nvidia legal teams
I've been regularly unplugging my 4090 to check the adapter because I'm so worried So far it looks perfectly fine
The real problem is that you have no idea of how many and yet you talk anyway try asking a repair center When there is an hysteria most are posting about their cases how many would have posted if their 8pin melted years ago just few maybe as it's not that interesting some for did for sure by they have simply ignored by most you can search the post here on reddit and compare comments and votes That's a flawed perception from a biased sample
The power rating for an 8 pin PCIe connector per the PCI SIG specifications is 150W but the electrical rating of the connector itself is 300W We haven't had problems before because the amount of headroom is massive
No You are holding it wrong
I'd like to believe that but then I think about all of the posts I've seen in the past year or so about people buying something like a 3090ti and not knowing how to plug it in or not understanding why they aren't seeing massive gains in Warzone at 1080p etc lol
You would think but then go look at the builds people have posted that show very obvious mistakes being made
You are not really wrong It's just that delicate handling should be to minimize user errors There should be manufacturer errors caused by regular handling
Almost had me fooled until I saw the s dammit
as a moderate pc builder 3 pc's completed at this point in time not to mention upgraded my own mobo from a 2012 asus to a 2020 msi i always power on the fan temporarily to make sure which way it's blowing air before i even CONSIDER putting it on my case 5 10s of troubleshooting can save you 3 hours of headaches posting online
Actually being a tech illiterate means buy Nvidia RTX 4090 or so it seems
Try that in the 4000D For some reason they put the HDD cage 10cm closer to the PSU than it needed to be and wasted a bunch of space at the front of the case Tbf that's the single gripe I have with that case though
Only matters so much if you go to screw it in and the HDD cage is still really close and causes the cables to move Or if you made the mistake of a semi modular PSU '
Why the fuck would you buy a modular PSU if your pro tip is to plug in all the cables
Right I haven't had an actual HDD since 's some people who like to store any and all media they have on them rather than just streaming or redownloading it
Only reason why I still have a mechanical disk is because I wanted a massive backup drive that could hold the 30 years of data I have scattered across various drives on a single device and it's difficult to find a 12TB NVME Not to mention that I didn't want to spend 400 just to backup all my old PCs
I have no idea what kind of 4tb ssd is cheaper than a hdd but ok
All the melting issues are on the GPU side If they're only going to show one picture not both ends of the cable they should at least show the side where the problems are
Sata pci e usb If you plug any of those half way they don t melt down
Literally every wall plug in the UK There'll be dozens of others it's not exactly complicated or counterintuitive to design such plugs They make obvious sense
POOR TASTE AND INABILITY TO READ THE ROOM FROM MSI
That I agree with Even though I think the content of the post is sensible You should certainly be doing all those things anyways IMO
Just to very likely also end up with a burned cable I think you and I have different definitions of very likely Mine doesn't include 0 1 events
Why
We could blame them for creating a product that is easier to create user errors than the previous products they released NVIDIA cards don't seem to have that problem so why other manufacturers They created cables that need high tolerances in pc builds that usually don't require such high tolerances When ever did we need to worry about how much of the cable is straight and not bent when coming out of the power supply
Except for the fact that 1 People plugged it in fully with it flush against against the GPU port and it still melted as in seen in the latest case with photo evidence and 2 Some cables are literally impossible to fully seat due to manufacturing out of tolerance
ya if NVIDIA comes out with you're plugging it in wrong people are gonna flip their shit even if it's god's own truth fuck at this point people are gonna flip their shit no matter what NVIDIA says
The simple reality is that if the connector is so poorly designed that it s this easy for insertion to fail in such a critical and potentially dangerous way that isn t really user error That s horrible connector design
Even if fully seated connector alone is not enough to prevent failure it has been shown to reduce temperature compared to not fully seated Basically the swiss cheese model Just because fixing one layer doesn't prevent failure in every case doesn't necessarily mean there is no issue with that layer The 3 main layers right now are probably 1 defects 2 user error and 3 ambient condition Fixing defect and design is Nvidia's responsibility Fixing user error is personal responsibility Ambient condition is out of one's control but 4090 in lower ambient temperature will have higher headroom for failure
even if that's the case the plug should not have that small room of tolerance regardless if its user error or not
A simple way to solve this would be to make the prongs of the plug bright fluro yellow to make it easier to see if your plug is inserted all the way if you see yellow push more good fellow
What leading theory You've got 2 people including GN that literally broke off ends of cables and jayz that did both and didn't plug them all the way in Whatever is wrong with these cables only Nvidia knows and their silence is deafening they are still selling gpus and gpus are still burning
Liquid Spring suspension tried this multiple wire approach to add power to an electric motor they also melted and LS issued a recall for the unit This problem isn't going away as the connectors get older the resistance at the connector will rise and this will continue to melt cables I've seen it at least 3 times in various industries
Literally evidence in the megathread lmao
If you watched the video the conclusion besides user error is that these cables are arguably of pretty poor quality for something that comes with a 1600 MSRP product and are very easy to perceive as properly inserted whilst not really being properly inserted Also this kind of user error falls entirely on the manufacturer because most people who buy GPUS arent on reddit and will never visit forums or even watch GN those people will simply plug their gpu in firmly and think theyre good to go and some of them will suffer as we've seen x200B Now the other elephant in the room Nvidia which 100 probably knows about this more than anyone yet they chose to stay silent and keep selling these cards adapters without any statements whatsoever Meanwhile independent groups like Igors lab Jayz2cents Gamers nexus and many more that have not even a fraction of the funding that nvidia has did nvidias dirty work for them Its insane to me that you need GN to do a full forensic study and send official nvidia parts to an actual testing facility which isnt fucking cheap and comes out of their own pocket to unveil the screwup of a multi billion dollar company that just refuses to give a shit That right there is the real issue if anyone still defends nvidia with the ridiculous pricing with the scummy marketing of a 4080 4070 ti with the silence on very expensive hardware burning for whatever reason without issuing an official statement let alone acknowledge it exists says everything you need to know about this company They don't give a shit about the end user only their bottom line And the sad part is that you will still have fanboys and apologists denfeding them to their last breath Which sucks because they DO have the best GPUs as of now and that puts alot of us that do use our fucking brains and do have some self respect with literally 0 choice at one point or another if we want good hardware at a reasonable price you know like the 1080ti and 3080 for example x200B Like ill be honest my 1080TI wont last forever eventually ill have to get a new GPU im not sure if itll be AMD or Nvidia by that time but thanks to people rewarding these companies greed i know ill probably never get another 1080tis worth of performance value Ever and the cheapest ill get to having a high end GPUis above 1k which is fucking ridiculous
The average size is how big Oh man I must be hung like a horse
Yeah unless you have some big chungus case I'm sure a lot of people will need to get 90 180 adapters
if you insist on side panel on you'll FAandFO
I don't get
Some people have pets toddlers care about dust control etc
I actually looked too and my current 3080 is 140mm and I have 3 connectors on that so maybe it will fit eyes
You work for Nvidia or MSI You're everywhere in this post
Is the Ducati gonna burn up if I don't screw on the gas cap just right
With all the evidence is plausible to claim that there are users playing with melted cables that are still unaware of the issue
My comment wasn't about how many people are effected It's about how serious it is to the people that have had it happen It basically makes the card untrustworthy and needing an RMA That's at minimum a 1600 RMA but only FE card are priced that low In my eyes that's not something the manufacturer should be memeing about
I've actually shied away from MSI so this sort of seals the deal for me
Can you actually provide testing that showed a melted cable from improperly sseated cables I keep seeing guys like you saying it as fact but I haven't seen any produced melt by media or experts but I may have missed it
The adapters are melting even when fully plugged in There has been at least one case thus far
The article said that the 7000d had ample room for the card implying that the melting occurred without stress on the plug
You keep contradicting yourself In other comment you said tech reviewers have bent the cable and found thats not the cause Now you said the cable bend is whats causing that problem Maybe stop commenting things that you dont knw
It's also possible that it can melt with being fully seated I keep seeing it posted as fact that the melt is from improperly seated cables did I miss an article where someone actually got it to melt I did see one where the temps were super high but no melt
Definitely possible
You only get upvotes here if you fuck up unfortunately
Evidence from Igor GN etc shows that it is plausible for adapters to be manufactured out of tolerances making them hard to fit contributing to the problem Hell even cablemod stated that the shroud of the cables they made didn t allow for a proper fit in some cards
I m just trying to get away from a Y splitter adapter just want a direct connection
Your words not mine A simple plug n play connection should not require a step by step how to guide That's just poor design choice
Hehe
I will leave the pedo stuff to the pedos
I changed my Lian Li 011 XL to a COrsair 7000D to make sure there was enough space Previously I had upgraded my original 011 Dynamic to the XL when my EKWB waterblock on the EVGA 2080ti FTW3 wouldn't allow me to close the side panel I was happy with each case before each of these GPUs came along and pushed me to buy another one
COrsair 7000D I upgraded from an NZXT H510 to a corsair obsidian 1000d because of this card The case is pretty damn impressive enough though it did cost me as much as a CPU But now I can finally game like a real PC gamer
I was actually just wondering what type of case to get for my next build skipping this gen of chips and GPU's Might go back to horizontal cases or do wall build or in desk nbsp But hopefully the mid range cards are reasonably sized
Lol time for test bench setups
But have a couple inches space away from the wall for heat and air issues like a metal grid mounted first then the pc mounted on it I'm being a bit sarcastic but I think that may be the thing to do I don't have much experience mounting a pc to a wall
Why have it on the desk instead of the floor on a riser The desk should be reserved for beefy speakers monitors in my opinion
Ooh nice I always liked the sleek look of that case
Personally even though the connector cleaned my build up and hasn t melted it s all been positives BUT Why didn t the just stick with 8pin and run them out the side of the card I miss you EVGA
I've only got M 2 and it's still a mess The extra cable length has to be hidden somewhere The visible part of my case is pristine and perfectly routed Just don't look under the metal panels lol
Same infact the only reason I even noticed was my computer building experience The average person isn't going to feel something isn't quite plugged in or triple check
Exactly how it went for me to a T I actually grabbed the card from the back and push the cable in until it clicked It's absurdly snug and can easily see people thinking its in when it's not Poor design all around for that much pressure needed on incredibly fragile and expensive electronic equipment
So I lifted the 'tab' that's on the connect itself put my case sideways and applied heavy force with one hand while holding the case with the other So you had to resort to almost breaking your motherboard just to put the cable in properly
Bro I have the same card Go grab the Msi 5 0 psu Adaptor was like butter
Just to put it into perspective I didn't have that seeding issue with my FE so it may just be a Gigabyte thing More fiddly than a pair of 8 pins but didn't have to put a ton of pressure for it to click
Now we needs a chart of the reported case on all of the series so we could see which one rank higher
Over 15 years you're bound to get some outliers but by and large the 6 8 pin connector has been fine
so what this says is that assuming the ratio of reported to non reported cases is roughly equal the 4090 has had as many if not more cases of melting than everything in the last 11 years
People prefer to scream like monkeys and point finger instead of looking at reality if someone had a doubt that we descend from monkeys they just need to look how people behave on the internet and social networks I one thought that PC gamer were among the most rational and science engineering oriented mind I was plain wrong or we changed
GOLD It doesn't matter if they are miners mining pulls less power than gaming and card should be able to pull 150 watts per 8 pin all day long Sir I have nothing but this upvote but thank you for the reality check and public service
Out of those 11 4 are from mining alone Calculating how much more stress it puts on those cables or if its actually about constant load that caused those melt downs is another story What i'm trying to say is for how many users there are online this number is very low and acceptable unlike the 4090 disaster with threads about it popping up every few hours and many more cases that are unknown to us
And here's more than twice that many over a much shorter period 's absolutely zero question that this new connector has far more cases of this than the old one especially when you consider how many fewer 4090s there are than there are cards with the 8 pin which has been ubiquitous on high power GPUs since what the GTX 280 or so EDIT no even longer actually The 9800GX2 also had the 8 pin though the 8800 Ultra got by with a pair of 6 pins instead
Fucking MSI can't even keep their own support website no manual that's on the DVD quick start guide fails to list needed items and has incorrect outdated info on it Website is absolutely useless and yes I tried the international site too utter crap Who TF ships a DVD in 2022 I get you don't want to print a manual but QR codes for downloads and DVDs are utter bullshit Drop the fucking dime on a USB drive shit comes free with some lightsabers I've seen that cost less than this board MSI has zero excuse for this combo of incompetence
Or maybe following actual testing and physics laws
Plugging and unplugging degrades the cable port very fast
While that's fair there's a really simple way to remember for fans One side of every single fan is completely open just fan blades the other side has arms that go from the fan's frame to the center hub and holds the hub on That second side will always be the direction air blows out from without exception Open side is always where air is sucked in
lol interesting take x200B posted on my LoveLake Raptor Lake x Asus 4090 PC
Yeah I've had the 4000D af and currently use a 5000D af I just pulled the cage on both immediately because I have no use for hdd's Unless u want to lek my entire stream library of 150 games installed 2x 2tb m 2 nvme drives more than cover my needs
Fair enough I haven't personally used a hdd in 7 years or so I imagine some people need the storage for some reason but I'm content with 2ea 2tb m 2 drives I guess maybe content creators who don't want to use a NAS are a use case for hdd's in 2022 that make sense with a 1600 gpu
They meant the cables you're going to use Plug your cables in leaving the ones you aren't using out and then put the PSU in the case
Think harder
I mean I have a NAS with HDDs in it for shared storage backups but not inside my gaming PC that's what I meant
The layman consumer doesn t have or need a 4Tb SSD
I do agree that they should show both ends of the cable because there is a chance that someone thinks one side can bend and the other can't Scary that someone so stupid would have a 1600 gpu but unfortunately idiots have rich parents

Pretty sure all of those plugs can be plugged in incorrectly my point was more that human error cannot be completely designed out and that the molex connector isn't the issue The issue is with Nvidias choice to put such large amounts of power through the plug that we are now seeing these failures Molex connectors have not been an issue as far as I'm aware up until now Manufacturers blaming consumers for not plugging it in correctly is a poor excuse for their own oversight in the design of these cards
Most UK wall plugs only function when pretty much fully inserted no That is literally one of the safety features of the socket There is literally nothing wrong with the molex connectors themselves They are irreversible latching connectors The root of the issue is Nvidias decision to operate these connectors likely at their maximum ratings for whatever reason Nvidia poorly engineering doesn't make a connector bad all of a sudden
I guess that's nothing new I don't really follow companies on social media or in general so have no base for reference
MSI loves memes so much that this one actually happened No shot though their reputation went down fast after that guy slipped on a banana peel
They are an incredibly shitty company that tries to screw their customers whenever they can Scalping their own products paying for good reviews shunning people who give them bad ones the list goes on
Yet bending it in lab tets didn't recreate the melting effect It was only not properly plugging it in
Is it possible that people with melted cables only pushed it properly in for the photos after they discovered they hadn't to save face and make sure they can get it repaired I'm only suggesting this because the only people who have actually video documented trying to replicate the issue have found that it happens when it's not plugged in properly I tend to trust GN and JohnnyGuru more than an unknown customer
People plugged it in fully with it flush against against the GPU port Some cables are literally impossible to fully seat due to manufacturing out of tolerance These statements contradict each other If some cables cannot be seated properly due to defects then some cables definitely weren t fully inserted
How can that be an excuse If the connector can't be fully seated it means there is a problem and you need ask for an MRA if you run your PC anyway you take your own risk and blaming others for your stupid decision is just childish Connectors melt even when fully in due to defects in it or problem on the card it happen even with the old 8pin one these are some relatively recent post when there wasn't an hysteria with everyone posting their melted connector or even their not melted one 1 card 8 pin connector melted how to 2 3080 pcie cables are melting 3 rtx 3090 xtreme burns 8 pin psu cabers at 4 do i stop pcie cables from melting burning 5 3080 pcie cables are melting 6 my graphics card cable just melt 7 plug for my gigabyte aorus extreme 3090 wb 8 rtx 3090 hof 9 gpu power cable melted and now i cant plug it 10 8pin melted inside gpu is there an easy way 11 Gaming comments psf33a xpost my 3080 gaming x trios power connector
People here you mean Not normal people
Absolutely agree It's going to make the horde of 4090 haters who jumped on JayCTwoCents' bandwagon on this subreddit look like absolute fools Again Seriously why does anyone believe a word that click bait creator say It's not the first time he's made a mountain out of a molehill
Who are we kidding It's Nvidia They could shoot somebody on 5th Street and people would continue to buy their graphics cards in droves
one thing though that beast eats 450 watts plus power draw and can boost to over 600 watts draw those connectors are still the same size so they do get very hot at the connection so if pins loose in connector melt down same thing causes house fires and car fires
It's really not that difficult to ensure the existing cables are plugged in properly mine required just a little more force than an 8 pin GPU power plug
Well thats still not that easy because of manufacturing of the cable I am using the be quiet adapter cable which doesnt insert completely there is about 1mm gap but it just wont get in their fully if i had pushed it more it wpuld have broken the plug of the gpu itself or the graphics card would have become some damage in the pcie slot or the pcie slot itself Still used my card for the last month without any burning smell or crashes or anything so guesses are nothing has melted yet I still do believe the main issue is the poorly constructed adapter by nvidia most cases of melting are nvidia adapter cables In my personal opinion main reasons are 1 like said nvidia adapter 2 putting it in on an angle like shown on the second meme which might leads to issues i inserted mine really straight in line with the plug so it did go in straight
rolling on the floor laughing
Clearance envy
You aren't supposed to bend the new adapter for 35mm on top of the huge size of the cards means that you need a lot of space in a x200B
Yes I'm the vp of marketing for MSI North America You caught me
Possibly yes Just like the handling could be unsafe if you adjust the easily adjustable suspension settings the wrong way or you crash at highway speeds if the tire blows because the pressure was low and you didn't check
If the cable melted a little then stopped melting is it really a problem anymore Maybe the cable wasn't properly seated and the melting stabilized the contact at that pin
I agree 100 it sucks But as long as the companies have been good about rma ing which I think they have if you have the money I would go for it I bought my 4090 knowing full well that it would wind up having to get shipped back to MSI I was willing to take that risk I look at it like this could theoretically happen with any component Do you run every drive in your computer on raid 1 in case you have a drive failure I don't I just have one spinning drive that I back up monthly But my system ssd is just running without a backup If it fails I may lose some things not backed up That's worse to me than being down a video cards for two weeks
Loose connection 100C Good connecttion 60 70C took me 10 sec to find this Loose connection testing by GALAX with a 12VHPWR connector
Not sure why the downvotes despite this being true Fully plugging in the cable does not guarantee it won't melt if it's a defective cable
Wow at least one cases And how many 8pin melted Also did you verified that it was indeed fully connected
It can say that but the 750d and 7000 are almost the exact same width I'm telling you 100 there is going to be a pretty good bend in that cable It shouldn't be enough to cause a problem but who knows with this stupid design I will say every 4090 needs a 90 adapter
I'm not contradicting myself GN and other reviewers said bending isn't the issue Nvidia says not to bend the cable Those are the contradictory statements The article says the 7000 case has ample room to not bend the cable thus the author is implying the cable should not be bent I'm just saying that the 750 7000 case does not have space for the cable without a severe bend with the side panel on I was just relaying the contradictory information I have received and correcting an error in the article regarding clearance for the cable
There is no explanation for why a few cables are melting at the connection point while everyone else has working cables We know the cables have shit UX s fully seated Even if there was something wrong with the cable based on reports on this sub and expert testing it looks like proper seating is the main issue Even if some other defect was increasing temperatures chances are the cable could tolerate it If it s not properly seated it s game over for sure
That because 95 don't care of the real cause they just playing the blame game to sound smart ans savvy following the herd and repeating the same BS like parrot or turkey I should say
Just adding to this we're currently tweaking the shroud design to solve this issue that happens with some cards
More like a M lol
If to insert a cable you need a step by step guide then assembling a PC or any other electricity involved DIY isn't for you
It does not that article only caused confusion
I've already talked to Nvidia and it doesn't void the warranty on the fe cards at least
You don't have to tell them lmao I blew my RM650 up cos I repinned a cablemod pcie cable wrongly when installing closed combs from pexon on them and I just told my local distributor corbell idk what happened but heard a pop sound and my house's circuit breaker tripped and I got a replacement no questions asked
That sounds like an illegal practice in the EU you'd have to prove that the 3rd party cable was the reason for the failure
Do you only charge things like your phone with only provided usb cable
How on earth would that void your warranty That would be like a mobile phone no longer having a warranty if you used a third party charger
Oh hey fellow xeon user have you thought of upgrading to a xeon x5675 It's very good
I really can't stand how much jays2cents seems to effect the way people think He is making BANK on this situation It has always been nvidias policy to use their adapters and no one cares because first of all you are probably one of the 99 99 of people who don't have a burning cable And second we take our cards apart change thermal pads put waterblocks on and off and still try to claim warranties many times successfully How are they going to prove you aren't using their adapter Nvidia has to set a standard to cover their ass and make sure they arent liable when people use 20awg cables from China It looks bad now that they have some faulty adapters out there but in practice it doesn't really make a difference
Using a 3rd party cable cannot void your warranty in the united states The manufacturer would need to prove the new cable caused the damage
I really like my o11 so I really don't want to change if I can avoid it That 90 degree adapter from cablemods will help
But what is a real pc gamer A What is a computer
Something like a Thermaltake Tower 500 may be
That answer is simple PCB space 4 8 pins takes up significantly more PCB space than the new 12VHPWR connector My guess is that some small amount of cards and or adapters had some manufacturing defects preventing solid connection on all of the pins There is nothing inherently wrong with the 12VHPWR connector assuming defect free manufacturing
This commenter is from the future 3 0 psu's just came out for the rest of us
Haha I'm going to stick it out with my corsair HX850i it's a really solid PSU and I've not had any issues I had 4 free 8pin slots on the PSU side anyway so the cablemod cable was fine I'm signing up for the 180 degree adapter too wonder if I'll be able to close my side panel with
Same as the 12vhpwr has been fine Let's not forget when 30 series came out and they were melting like butter on Thanksgiving 14 or so cases for 125 150k cards is nothing compared the what was happening 2 years ago with 3080s and 90s Certain things people just love to hate on
that would be a big assumption People are actively seeking and reporting this because there was a huge deal made about the potential for these cables to burn before they were widely used via Jayztwocents video Once the first cable burned it became proof of bias and other reporting subsequently followed fueling further hunts So more than likely the ratio of reported to burned cables is not anywhere near the same as the 8 pin plugs It's why there are all those maybe posts in the main thread the majority of which look like scuffed cables I think the biggest takeaway is that in none of these posts did anyone demand immediate mass recalls for 8 pin cables due to them being potential fire hazards People were just told to contact their GPU or PSU manufacturers and get it replaced under warranty You know like the sane people we were before all this happened Also he said last year or two That wouldn't be 11 years
I one thought that PC gamer were among the most rational and science engineering oriented If we were at all rational we wouldn't be PC gamers
There weren't massive youtube videos about the issue prior though so most people just rma'ed without making a thread
Miners undervolt to maximize profit and constant load at those powers isn't gonna be more stressful for the connector You simply decided that the connector is the problem and now you try to adapt reality to your idea instead of the contrary
So it's a disaster that 14 of 150k 0 01 are having issues when 30 series had 8pins melting like crazy reddit has those receipts too Go look No People are just believing what they want making assumptions and running away with it It's exactly like some sick political rumor that the masses eat up because the person is easy to hate Good for J bro But don't expect me to respect you after promoting this lunacy without any actual clue what's going on
Rip optical drive Stone Age to 2022
GN said you can only plug un plug 3
Which is something I've also worried about however I did read that that wasn't or shouldn't be an issue Besides a port shouldn't degrade after only a dozen plugs I've probably done 3 so far I did buy a new cable from cablemod though so it won't be an issue soon
Penis Posted on my smart penis 40000 bet you feel real dumb right about now
Look at all those downvotes Envy is a bitch and 90 of the reason this is even being discussed Facts and real information be damned when the masses get ahold of an excuse to hate on something they either can't afford or can't justify spending These are the same people praising AMD for having a 1 000 price point on a product that is slower than Ampere in ray tracing you aren't spending 1 000 to be handicapped in ray
The issue is moreso if budget RTX 4K uses it I run a 3070 5600X with two NVMe drives a SATA SSD and a 4TB 7200 RPM HDD for video capture and mass storage in the event the apocalypse happens
gamers too they are huge now days
thermaltake p90 case has the best HDD mounts ever
I use HDD for local backup reason and general data hoarding I already have a second pc for NAS PLEX
Thank you for explaining this
They could easily get an affordable 4tb hdd They go for like 150 bucks You're arguing semantics at this point
I'm a layman consumer and I just bought a 14TB HDD because I like keeping my media where I can get to it That much SDD would cost a ridiculous amount plus with a HDD I can unplug it and stick it in a closet for a decade without losing the data You can't do that with an SSD E man the amount of people commenting in these specific hardware subs who don't seem to know anything about hardware has been absolutely wild
The layman consumer does not need an SSD they just run a 1TB 5400rpm SMR HDD
Something 't need more than 256KB of RAM
The point that you can't seem to grasp is that literally no one has posted an issue with the cable at the psu connection but that's what msi decided to focus on A second and also important part of the issue is that a normal case often doesn't have enough clearance to avoid bending because they insist on locating their subpar connection on the top of the card instead of somewhere that isn't crammed against the side panel
Mate what kins of a bubble do you live in that you think all that not knowing how these things work makes you stupid
IMO eventually the processor will use too much energy for a standard outlet upon which you will have to subscribe to a gfx streaming service like GeForce now if you want the latest hardware
Looks like these are good for 600w but they're pumping 550w on full load and OCed People downvote your but you're right I don't know how it got approved with all the regulation they need to go through for general public sale They could've put some sort of switch or sensor to detect whether or not it's fully engaged connected or I don't know I'm not an engineer but they could've done something for sure
They all have past skeletons on their closets so to speak So if you wanted to buy from a drama free aib manufacturer you're dead out of luck
So what do you think is a good Nvidia company Because now that EVGA kicked the bucket the field is pretty barren
At this point I don't think there's a single component company with a clean record Although with MSI it really feels like they're trying their best to do a bad job
Several tech YouTubers tested it not being properly plugged in Glad your so omegabrained you solved it by yourself
Sorry I might have missed an article or someone's testing showing actual melt I thought so far they only produced high heat no actual melt via improperly plugged in cables x200B The test from Jon Gerow that he posted on his site didn't actually have melt I only saw that he posited it as being the problem yet everyone seems to be saying it as fact
I tend to trust someone who can actually replicate the issue neither Jonny guru jayz Igor or GN have all they've proven is that not inserting it fully will increase temp by about 10C 10C on a plastic that is supposed to take 170 250C before melting or not booting at all As a 4099 owner the plug was surprisingly easy to insert easier than any 6 2 pin plug Edit i might add that if it was this hard to insert the plug why didn't any of the 3070 3080 3080ti 3090 3090ti FE models catch fire Were dealing with a new issue only affecting the 4090
Is it possible that people with melted cables only pushed it properly in for the photos after they discovered they hadn't to save face and make sure they can get it repaired I'd say that's highly likely If there was an actual issue with the cable itself there would have been thousands and thousands of cases of it melting
Ah i see thank you
people don't wanna take any personal responsibility
Idk how to break this to you but generally cables aren t supposed to melt when in use
I don't know if you drive and your tire deflates by 30 and then stops Is it a problem Just keep driving there's nothing bad that can happen
Thank you I hadn't seen this before x200B edit bit confused by the picture though is that top cable all melted too 's crazy Or is it just high temp no melt
utm medium android app utm source share Just because it goes against what you want to believe doesn't mean you need to be confrontational
The max cpu cooler height of the 7000d is 190mm That's pretty insane compared to most cases that leaves you 150mm for the gpu and 40mm for the cable
So basically you're just changing the narrative to blame everything on the card owner and not on nvidia k got it
Neither PCIe 5 0 nor ATX 3 0 have any kind of protection against amperage imbalance between wires One single thick wire is easier to protect against overcurrent Anderson Powerpole connector is the true and tested method of delivering high current 12V

That's called fraud
This is the case in the US as well
It doesn't even matter if it's legal or not because it not true the story was made by a pseudo journalist which didn't care to verify and just stopped at the first thing he found interesting This have been debunked many times and yet people still trowing BS like monkey at the zoo because nowadays people have become emotional drama queen and they don't care to share facts
Of course a mobile phone company will void your warranty if you use a 3rd party cable This is standard practice for a company It has to be in writing on their end but it is typically not enforced unless it's an extreme scenario A company should not be held liable when someone uses a cable from China that accidentally swapped 2 of the pins and blew something up
Hello there So after more then a decade on i7 950 and my x5650 I kept running into codec issues for rendering and playing videos as well as cpu codecs for video games so I had to upgrade it's insane how much faster things are now with Ryzen However at 1080p my x5650 x58 Mobo was absolutely crushing every game I threw at it I just kinda sucks I had to abandon my system cuz it works perfectly
Because it is not true I'm pretty sure someone here reached asus and they told him so is a new atx 3 0 psu a third party cable The nvidia adapter is connected to third party 8pin is it also voiding the warranty and even if it was true how can they know Technically overclocking a cpu also voids the warranty and I have yet to see anyone telling people who ask talk about it not to do it because of warranty because again they have no way of knowing that
Because that may be truthful in some countries but definitely not the USA or most of Europe and Jazy is from the US so he should absolutely know better
I like how people keep assuming I watch that person lol
Yeah you are spot on I got all urgent and had a 4090 before the 90 degree was launched so took early action I also had left my XL to get so dirty inside during ETH mining 24 7 365 with no dust filters on so decided a fresh case was relatively justifiable and it had to be large
Yea that one is definitely kind of unique Lots of room inside to work with as well nbsp I guess even a chonky card should be okay if its hanging from above
I would get an air purifier before buying more hardware in that case Living in dusty environments for prolonged periods will mess you up my sinuses were swollen like a demon before I bought one If you use a riser like this for the case the dust won't be a problem AC SL1000 jpg
It's just crazy to me that OP thought that doing this was OK and that illustrates the problem for most people there should not be this many caveats to owning a high end GPU It hasn't been a problem for over a decade since we ditched 4 pin Molex for the 6 pin PEG design The vast majority of boards will have at least two screws securing the board to the chassis in line with the first PCIe slot but that's a lot of strain to put on everything when it's already installed
Lol the portal to the future is under my desk
I disagree on this there are undoubtful advantage of PC
Are you saying 4090 cable meltdown issue is a hoax made up by Jayztwocents and others or am i missing something here
Ok good but the port you are plugging your cable gets worse too and you can't replace that like that
Besides a port shouldn't degrade after only a dozen plugs It's only rated for something like 30 cycles so yeah stop doing that
It is hilarious I had no idea i was going to get to drink salty dolt tears in my coffee yet here we are 30 downvotes is impressive but you know what is even MORE impressive RTX 4090
Curious how do you get enough power during apocalypse Modern technology requires absurd amount of energy if it were manually generated by hands
I feel personally attacked
I went full SSD in my gaming rig because they're easier to fit inside the case and the loading access speed improvements are nice
the TBW is annoying too
Though people who know less or nothing about hardware would be more layman no
i disagree respectfully
Calm down buddy I'm agreeing with you To your points 1 There are very few ATX3 0 psu's vs 4090s Maybe there is a problem with the cables at the psu but we just don't know yet Or maybe it's not the cable at all and it's something with the cards themselves like a poor trace or soldering or something like that 2 Even a large case like my 750d doesn't have room for the cable I have a Suprim Liquid so about as small as you can get and I still am running with the side panel off I think your only option is something like a o11 1 Vertical mounting won't solve the problem either as most cards even if they can be vertically mounted would be right up against the side panel and not getting any air into the cooler 3 I don't have a problem with the location of the connector I do have a problem with the card manufacturers not including a 90 adapter with each card This is not cablemod's problem to solve yet they are the only ones working on it The big issue here is that there will need to be several models based on cooler size The manufacturers could have just included this with the cards and solved a lot of problems
Cable with two of the same ends Warning issued don't bend the cable near the end In the real world someone with enough brains to buy a 1600 video card wouldn't need to be told since both ends are the same don't bend near either end There's no way someone who can't figure that out makes enough to afford a 4090 unless they live in their parents' basement
I think too You'll need a 20A outlet to power your PC Right now it's tight 120V at 15A is good for 1800W but with the 80 safety factor in Canada but I think in USA too it's a breaker safety you're down to 1440w available With ppl having 2 3 screens lights a PC needing close to 1000w in full load sooner or later 15A wont be enough
They've done a TON of sketchy shit including being at the forefront of price gouging their own products being overly aggressive to any critiques straight up lying when they get caught out on shit Don't get me wrong I've owned my fair share of MSI products over the years and I still occasionally need to pick up one of their components which can be very good products But when presented with a choice of other products in the same league from different companies I almost always choose the other even if the premium is a wee bit higher
Figures As long as their product is reliable and good quality with decent costumer service that works for me MSI seems to check those boxes not that evga is out of the game so to speak
Not much really ASUS is probably the closest Their products usually last long enough that you don t need to deal with any RMA process etc
I'm not sure what is good but I'm pretty confident that MSI is at the bottom of the pack Fattest guy at fat camp sort of thing I'll still buy their products when I have no other choice but will generally try and go with anything else if it's available Other companies do these sort of things sure but it seems engraved in MSI's core values to fuck their customers over and sling mud around for anyone who calls them out
Also true It is the best of a bad situation It s like pick the one that hurts you the least MSI is all over the place doing random stabbings in the crowd gigabyte dropping a few bombs here and there ASUS setting up the next block over charging your firstborn to watch the show with an occasional pinky being sliced off
Correct the closest the testing came was to reach temps right on the thermal limit of the plugs
Edit i might add that if it was this hard to insert the plug why didn't any of the 3070 3080 3080ti 3090 3090ti FE models catch fire Were dealing with a new issue only affecting the 4090 Untrue see here 't have massive youtube videos talking about melting connectors so users didn't know it was something to post on social media about most people just RMA'ed
That's not how science works You're selectively throwing out data that doesn't match your hypothesis This kind of attitude needs to be purged
It's either that or a manufacturing error affecting a tiny itself If you look at the average RMA rates for electronics and graphics cards specifically this isn't abnormally high
That's reddit in general hence your downvotes Losers angry at successful people Crab bucket
Really Oh shit I've had it wrong all this time Thanks for clearing that up for me I just upvoted your comment
Good analogy going from 35 to 24 5 psi isn't going to cause a catastrophic failure Chances are your tpms light would come on and you would check the air level the next time you stop Just like the cable that burned and stopped losing some psi is bad but not the end of the world And just like a 4090 with a burned cable or pin if the tire was under warranty you would get it replaced and continue on with your life Just like you wouldn't give up driving because a tire may go flat you wouldn't not buy a video cards because there is a 1 in 1000 chance or less you may get a defective part Thanks for clearing that up for everyone Couldn't have done it better myself Upvoted you too
Have been posted multiple times but apparently people are only interested in picture of melted connectors and complaining as they are the only post upvoted en masse while test like this gets ignored or even downvoted by 20 I posted one that's how I know and slip down in the page edit bit confused by the picture though is that top cable all melted too 's crazy Or is it just high temp no melt They use the adapter and and a connector removed from a card what you see is a special material used too keep the cable together and insulate the connector termination Keep in mind that the test have been done with a 1530W of constant load the adapter is well designed and the connector is fine here people just wanna complain and trash something The made also a pretty aggressive mechanical stress test to the adapter to prove it's not bad quality or have design flaws v hkN81jRaupA v hkN81jRaupA
Please explain how relaying information from two sources is changing a narrative I can't wait to hear this And actually I think the issue is most likely the board partners Their pcb designs are not the same as Nvidia so pretty hard to blame the GPU manufacturer for a company that has a design flaw in a board's power delivery If the board partners copied the 4090 fe design exactly then it could be Nvidia's fault or the partners' manufacturing process As it stands now it's either the board partners' design or manufacturing that are the likely culprits Sorry had to downvote you for your lack of reading comprehension and lack of common sense
Why do you think PSU manufactures go with that
Oh nooo not the billion dollar company having to reimburse me for their shit product how will I deal with the moral implications
Please tell me this is a joke and you have a dark sense of humor or something
Holy dumb
Maybe if you keep licking their boot you ll get a free card s
Then go tell on him cry baby
Tell that to Amazon hahahahhahahahaha
Of course a mobile phone company will void your warranty if you use a 3rd party cable Simply not true Source Samsung and Apple don't even provide chargers with their phones these days and not even third party repairs can void your warranty at least where I live
I tell people that 1st gen is only barely usable today A 3rd or 4th gen is way faster and of course since ryzens launch 8th gen were much bigger jumps
He does But clickbait
90 degree was delayed so it hasn't launched yet Why'd you let it get so dirty during eth mining I had a mining rig and my main pc that I mined with and I cleaned both pretty regularly
Oh no absolutely it was more of a joke Although while I love my computer there is sometimes a lot of work that goes into troubleshooting and maintenance
No I'm saying he's an idiot and feeding the assumptions that the masses are making without presenting facts in an objective way When everyone else is and the only way to get a cable hot enough to melt is to not plug it in all the way He is spreading conspiracy theories and amplifying every single case that happens Someone with 4 million views could've done the same thing to the 30 series if they wanted as cables burned at much higher percentages
True but on the other hand I don't want to risk a fire if it has started melting so I also feel the need to check
I don't see me hitting 30 anytime soon but yeah like I said to the other guy I don't see another option if I want to avoid more severe damage
But we don't have to manually generate it by hand Wind and hydroelectric energy are actually quite effective at producing 1 kw Not to mention gas or diesel generators but those have limited uses if the infrastructure has collapsed If you already had solar panels installed you could theoretically extend their lifespan if you clean them frequently and cover them during bad weather when they wouldn't be producing much anyway
shouldnt everyone has an opinion I have found
The fact that you see this as a flawless logic makes this conversation pointless I guess anyone who works as a social worker or lawyer and are inexperienced with computers must be basically braindead
ASUS has their own share of bad rep seeing as the TUF and specially the Strix are horrendously overpriced and have a nasty tendency to get coil whine But not much really is definitely correct sadly
Interesting Well personally I like to follow the general consensus as opposed to anything else and the general consensus is that Zotac is bottom of the pack in the US
Those are not 12 pin FE models or am I wrong
assuming something is the cause without being able to replicate it is You Jonny guru asshats just keep coming
Stalking people across different subs is something pedo would do pedo
The reactions to this type of interaction are always interesting There was one time in a different sub that after someone had possibly damaged their motherboard with an improper install I was just like just take it back and get a replacement Maybe don't mention how it happened Someone responded that it was fraud I got downvoted to hell even after I responded that I literally worked in RMA and that the retailer would get 100 of their money back from the manufacturer and that the manufacturer budgets for this type of thing and builds that into the price of the board Yet here we are with basically the same situation and it's the opposite reaction from readers Strange Not really complaining it's just interesting the way that folks react in opposite ways to nearly the same situation
They aren t wrong Not sure what you re confused about
Samsung and Apple won't cover 3rd party products It makes zero sense that they would Even if it is not packaged together you still need to use certain branded products Not sure where you live and I know some countries step in and can force companies to comply with certain things but this is what it's like for everyone else I don't see how a company could possibly cover 3rd party cables If you must
Tldr lazy I wrote a long reply but essentially I was struggling to cool the memory on the 3090fe when I had it mining at 128mhs So I did a whole bunch of stuff thermal pads extra heatsink on the backplate 15mm x 120mm noctua fan on rear heatsink etc I decided to remove the glass side panel of the case and also remove the dust filters to get max airflow The 3090fe was air cooled but a second GPU in the pc was watercooled as was the cpu I realised some of the 3x360mm rads were getting choked with dust but the of was so over radiatored that it got away with it I didn't want any down time on mining I had 11 GPUs mining 8 of which were watercooled so I just let it run and run I then decided after mining to take it pieces to clean it and then took it fully to pieces and bought a new mobo 13700kf and 4090 If I'd kept it clean I'd have been happy with my 9900kf and 3090fe as a gaming machine but once I took it to pieces I decided to spend money
the connection can easily take up to 1500w able to take upto 1500w and actually sustaining it in any environment without any consequences are two different things While rated for supposedly 1500w if its melting just because it was bend wrong way or something means its design flaw Cables are supposed to bend the only way to get a cable hot enough to melt is to not plug it in all the way If cable isn't being correctly plugged in then that's also a design flaw Maybe you should put up videos on youtube and explaining these stuff with sources
Just be careful with being careful D
If you're inexperienced with computers you don't buy a 1600 card that you need to monitor gpudrop to find You may buy a premade and never open the thing up but then this doesn't apply to you anyway since you didn't built and are not responsible Nice try though
True I forgot about that They are still just ahead enough of MSI to make them better Then you have gigabyte somewhere around here exploding its PSUs
Oh product wise MSI has some good products We're talking about their shittiness as a company more than the quality of their gear Zotac's gear may be shit but I don't think they take the lead on being douchebag company like MSI does
Yes they are earlier connectors not the 12 pin
Reddit is a fickle mistress
Yeah some people feel like corporations are their friend it's really fucking bizzare
Lighten up
Who said they'd be covering third party products I'm saying tbey can't enforce a cancellation of your warranty for the act of using a third party cable I've managed telco shops over a decade ago and then for a year in 2020 and at least in Australia that wouldn't be an acceptable reason If they can prove the use of a third party cable caused physical damage to the device then that may be another 's not likely to happen even in cases where the cable does cause a problem though modern phones have the ability to shut off the charging port if it detects an issue The topic seems to be discussing an outright voiding of warranty simply for using the third party cable not for the third party cable being the cause of the damage If thats the case where you live then I'm sorry you have to deal with such lax consumer protection
People hate the truth It's unpopular around here Just nod and agree friend Being smart and knowledgeable is a hindrance on Reddit Also take my upvote
How on earth is it a design flaw if 0 01 of the people don't plug it in all the way Wtf PC CABLES MELT BRO ALL THE DAMN TIME FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS It has been proven that there is nothing wrong with the connector or the standard It doesn't need to sustain 1500w but it can sustain around 900w Again nvidia's 12 pins melted on 30 series Some 16 pins melted on the 3090 ti and a MUCH larger percentage of 8 Pins melted on the 30 series Are those all design flaws Have you really never heard of pc cables melting before Sata and molex Come on guys
Lmao I will I'm eager to get my hands on the 90 degree adapter from cablemod
Sigh I'm not gonna botger pointing countless scenarios that thia doesn't account for
But I said specifically FE models in my post did I not The 12 pin connector have been in circulation for two years already but the 4090 is the one with burning pins
It's stealing some people have morals Simple as that
Ok so maybe I had something mixed up because for it to void the entire warranty if that's the case doesn't make much sense I didn't realize what we were talking about I guess
Literally everyone is recommending to keep the cable straight including MSI with pictures on how to do it Yet somehow its all fake If 30 series were melting as much as you said they were somebody 100 would have made videos on it This new connector in 40 series is clearly an outlier because its melting in the exact same spot and that is impossible unless it was clearly a design flaw
You do know the cables are rated for only 30 or so insertions right After that it may fail to make proper contact literally causing the issue you are paranoid about Set it correctly once check with a flashlight if you can and check the temperature on the plug while running a gpu benchmark and you'll be fine Re inspect if you accidentally kick the case or something
I don't really understand what specifically FE models has to do with it The idea that it's only a new issue affecting the 4090 is incorrect as there were a ton of burning incidents
You can refer to my original comment about those 'morals' You're the kind of guy that would try to hang Robinhood so maybe check your moral compass
Psh Who needs em
No worries I get what you where trying to say
Dude I really don't have time for this Just do a search and you'll find dozens of burned 30 series cards The fact that you need 1 of clearance before the bend is not noteworthy It isn't fake either so I'll leave it to you to figure out how both those things can be true at the same time Way more 8 pins burned with way less supply and the same with nvidias 12 pin Sata and molex are known for melting as well Use properly terminated connectors with proper cables and plug it in properly and you will have nothing to worry about Just like any other pc component It's 14 cables out of 150k 4090s for christ's sake Do me a favor and Google melting 8 pins This is not a new problem This is something being amplified with assumptions hate and envy 14 people having a design flaw does not indicate a design flaw This is the worst case scenario It indicates a failure in the supply chain But even that is giving people the benefit of the doubt because most likely they just aren't plugging them in properly People have bent the living hell out of those cables and it made zero difference
Yes I do I didn't know the number was as small as 30 though thought it was closer to at least a hundred
30 This is like turning on and off the PSU but worse Now what are you gonna tell me CPU insertion also have limited cycle
Yes it's a new issue affecting the 4090 but the connector is not new it's been used on almost all FE models of 3000 series minus the 4 sense pins So if it's so hard to push in according to guys like Jonny guru and it's all user error where are all the burned up 3000 series FE models What I'm trying to say is everybody is looking at the connector despite being over 2 years old but nobody is talking about how the power delivery on the pcb itself seems to always burn the same outer 12V pin
So I did you a favour and googled melting 8 pins I only found 1 mention of it in 6 pages that too on youtube v D2Ahkv 64rs and guess what it was about using daisy chain setup instead of using 2 separate cables for powering GPU and GPU was used for mining 3rd party manufacturers are literally releasing their own cables because they acknowledge this 12VHPWR cable issue also to make money ofc
It is literally 30 insertion cycles It doesn t mean it s gonna break after 30 but it could Certainly by 40 50 you ll see the plastic starts to deform
I can t read sarcasm but Intel cpu sockets like LGA 1150 and 1200 are rated for 15 20 insertion cycles However those insertions can be done with little to no force in a controlled way so they will probably withstand a lot more
I truly don't understand what you're saying firstly the connector is new and it's not used on the older models Secondly the older models have burned up
So basically this plug is my wife
It's the tiny fragile little pins One bad and depending they switch out CPUs alot
No not sarcasm Okay maybe half but I was thinking about pins like AM4 that AMD used to have so you were right about it I have no idea if the contact point like on the AM5 have any lifespan though
Are you for real The connector is NOT NEW it's the same 12 pin connector from the 3000 FE models 4 sense pins d that doesn't deliver power only telling what the connector should allow for wattage That's literally the only difference If the older models have burned then why did you link me to a bunch of 8 pins
Her butthole
Cause 16 pins burn 8 pins burn they all
For a percentage
Each patch requires significant testing yeah and so does shipping a base game which isn't complete until testing shows that it performs within reasonable expectations Why is this release written like they only learned about the poor performance after people started playing More games that are content complete should be delayed until fully tested and fixed
We are aware that Star wars jedi survivor isn't preforming to our standards Well considering you released the game in this state you clearly dont have good standards
But recommend Windows 10
There is so much gas lighting in that statement For a percentage No it's everybody Windows 10 users No it's windows 11 users too High end GPU paired with low end CPU No 5950x and 4090s can't even hit 60fps on any setting any resolution Either they're downplaying the number of players affected or they truly don't have a grasp on what's causing these problems I really hope it's the former
How to hide your incompetence Blame users or the OS Classic EA
Go buy better systems if you want to play our games but I have a 7800X3D and Nvidia 4090 Did I fucking stutter Go buy something better
Imagine calling the 7800x3D a low performing cpu
A percentage
Had this in the drafts for a while probably
Fuck EA
Yeah but the PS5 version is has 's windows Reviewer say to play it at 30FPS because the 60fps mode is extremelly stuttery
Apparently a 5900X is a lower performing CPU Guess I need to upgrade to a 7950X3D or some future CPU to be able to play this Thanks EA
Just dripping with corporate disdain of the end user How very expected
This is pretty hilarious lmao here's the source
Let me translate this for you We are a multi billion Dollar worth company which makes this money by meticulously measuring each and every expenses So as always we wanted to see how many people were willing to buy our game pre release and right after release so we could see if it is worth further bugfixing or upgrades But we couldn't see the negative criticism coming out so loud Normally we buy them but this time we spend all the money to advertisement and the Star Wars name So it is best to use free tools called lying and blaming others Who's there to blame Let's put it on Windows because why not It's not like they gonna lose a market share is it Anyway thanks for keeping buying our games and letting us harvest your data while you are trying to play We hope to God that early buyers will never ceize to exist
Don't you just love these triple A studio's
TLDR It's Microsoft's fault we didn't adequately test our game to save money
Did they use ChatGPT to write this statement
This is definitely a sense of pride and accomplishment level post Unreal
Well I'm adding this one to the list of reasons I haven't preordered a game in over 5 years when will people
A percentage of PC players LMFAO
I'm glad they're finally catching up with cutting edge technologies like multi threading What a joke
Our game sucks but look guys this is really hard Super complex and stuff Thanks for your money Don't worry we'll try and fix it But remember it's really hard Bye
high end GPU coupled with low end CPU So my 7900x is now 'low end' for my 4090 Ok how about 7800x3d others are having problems as well
Victim blaming
It not our fault you are not running the game with LN2 cooled 13900KS with 8GHZ overclock EA Respawn probably
70 dollars just to become a beta tester 70 fucking dollars
EA learn to code learn to test learn to optimise Blaming certain combination of hardware when your a AAA studio is pathetic it s not like this is the first PC game ever made
Maybe give us DLSS while you fix the problems
We will continue to monitor performance across all platforms and share update timing as soon as it is available after we have taken your money Suckers I've also now just learned EA has standards apparently
Sounds like some PR person was fed some buzz words and told to do a write up for damage control
That released statement is still in denial mode They are basically not accepting responsibility for the shameful state of the game at all The only way they will learn is financial ruin
Another reminder to stop pre ordering games Doubly true with these AAA companies They bean counters will never choose a stable release over taking the money risk free Apologies like this are easy to write and cost them nothing they have your money already this one was probably pre planned for a few days or even weeks
multi threaded chipsets designed for Windows Since when are CPUs designed for Windows 11 cutting edge You mean a CPU you can buy at the store
gif giphy 10JhviFuU2gWD6
It s almost like you guys should have further tested the game on various platforms before releasing it
Every UE4 game is unoptimized or what
Or hear me out on this one do not release a game in a broken state like this Ridiculous that these companies push this junk on people and expect them to just take it
wait but there's almost no difference between win 11 and win 10 right the registry even says Windows 10 on win 11 why would that be a game changer for CPUs
Bruh I'm on Windows 11 4090 and 13700KF The game dropped to 34 FPS At 1440p This ain't no Windows fault LOL
Back in my day testing occurred before a game was released
i am using a 4090 with a 13900K on W11 and i dunno Respawn I dunno EA still kind of running like shit and it actually frequently crashes with raytracing on lol
I have i7 13700k and overclocked RTX 4080 and the performance is just a joke fucking mess You lying morons just optimize the
So they poorly optimized their game and blaming someone else Nice
AMD sponsored Gimped
Me on a Win11 4090 13900K plus 32G ddr5 6400mhz ram renders the game at 4k with only 50 70fps How lovely
That entire statement after you convert it from corporate speech to plain english can be resumed in the following We blame you your pc your cow
So ea doesn't have a qa team Got it Makes sense why so many perhaps all Recent ea games are dogshit at launch They should really consider hiring a qa team to properly test their games and updates before releasing
Developing PC games to work on every conceivable hardware configuration is all part of the gig Passive aggressively Insinuating that the blame lies with someone who is running windows 10 on the latest CPUs as if the scenario is unheard of is really dumb As in so dumb I m not sure how they ever thought it was remotely a good idea Like it or not releasing a game on PC comes with obligations Either pay what it takes to do it right or don t do it at all
this reads like some middle age person with no computer knowledge wrote it wtf is multi threaded chipsets you mean a multi threaded processor or a cpu anyone who is delusional enough to think they will fix these issues needs to wake up fallen jedi had shader comp stutter as well as UE4 traversal stutter and never fixed it this game not only has horrid cpu bottlenecking vram usage issues but also traversal stutter this needs to stop and its not directed at just respawn ea its every publisher out there i really think that class action suits need to start happening these publishers non stop beg for pre orders and then when the game releases its not finished or in a pre beta state we are being charged the new 69 99 video game price which imo is bs over the 59 99 standard and we get crap in return if im paying an extra 10 bucks where the fuck is this going because it sure as shit not going towards proper QA or development rant
Is this the kind of pride and accomplishment EA told us about years ago
The consumer versions of Windows 10 especially 10 Pro work just fine with Threadripper chips now You no longer need Windows Enterprise or Linux to fully use 32 or more cores so this claim about multi threaded chipsets sounds like technobabble from a marketing major When you clear out all of the cruft EA confesses that their engine might be worse than Warzone and they do not completely understand why Faster hardware is not giving as good of performance as it should They actually said it runs like ass on high end CPUs and on low end CPUs both Or in other words they're blaming players for not playing on an old GPU that can barely throw 40fps at your tube monitor They are saying the CPU bottleneck should really be a GPU bottleneck but your GPUs are too good so the game runs bad What the heck excuse is that
Blaming windows 10 is fucking hilarious considering how similar the two OSs are Nevermind people actually having issues on 11
If i got a euro for every shit port I could buy a second 4090
I find it really hard to believe that they didn't know about these issues before Just corporate PR bullshit here
This imbeciles know about all and every performance issue not only EA and yet they are releasing games at such poor state Seems like this is reality a shitty one
Not like the game run well on console either just saw it go PowerPoint on a stream
Seen all this shit before Stick your stock corporate apology up you arse EA and Respawn
Man we need to start holding a biannual Mental Gymnastics Gaming Industry Edition The legal PR team behind amusing nonsense like this really don t get anywhere near the recognition they deserve
AAA gaming sure has hit a new low I have barely played 1 or 2 AAA games in the past 2 years because every release is either broken or takes them months to fix patch I am def a patient gamer but holy fuck man Good thing I have my indie games to keep me going
Okay explain why my 4080 sits at 40 usage and my 13700k at 20 while getting 48 fps at
Pretending to be surprised by the performance is the funniest shit
I am on Win 11 4090 and 7800X3D Got about 50 fps in 4K Yeah it ain't Windows 10 game isn't done send it back
Then explain my sub 60 FPS 1440p with my 7950x3D and 4090 using Windows 11
EA is such a shit company most people still game on Win 10 How can they not have trested on the platform prior to release Chances are QA flagged it and they chose to ship it Like they always have
Remember kids when you release a poorly optimized game just blame the operating system and everything will be fine
And they want 70 for it lol
thats fucking pathetic its already been shown that windows 11 has just as much problems
Dunno about anyone else but my PC gaming morale is really low right now First Resident Evil 4 same issue low GPU and CPU usage now this It's starting to feel like PC gamers are an afterthought again Oh well at least the Dead Space port is good
so then why is is running garbage on 4090 windows 11 installs too
Windows 11 I still get random freeze and non responsive spots regulalry
Yet again a company decides to release a product that runs like complete garbage and has to be fixed but also costs time I wish more companies would spend some more there but alas game making has turned into somewhat of a conveyor line process Also weird how they didn't find this earlier like during testing
While there is no single comprehensive solution for PC performance you have been making games on or for pcs for how many years now You re telling me you can t figure out how to improve performance yet indie devs new to the game space can
65 of pc gamers use Windows 10 EA are idiots Make the game on 10 then make the compatability for 11 after
Cpus and windows are fine Denuvo destroys frame times and hits older cpus pretty badly RE Village and removal of it completely fixed the game for me at least Thanks for understanding Lmao I guess refund volume has been brutal With how important and vocal pc market is you would think these companies take the hint and put in the work before the release
players using cutting edge multi threaded chipsets designed for Windows 11 were encountering problems on Windows 10 or high end GPUs coupled with lower performing CPUs also saw unexpected frame loss What the actual fuck of a statement is that I didn t know that Ryzen 7000 and Intel 13th Gen we re designed for Win11 and not Win10 So a 4090 coupled with a 7800X3D or 13900K literally the fastest gaming CPUs money can buy right now are considered lower performing CPUs by EA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
QQ does Windows 11 really running this game faster
I ve got windows 11 and got the game free with my 7700x Gonna try it when I get back but John at dsog said it ran fine at 4K fsr 2 quality RT on his rig 4090 7950x3d though he disabled smt
bitch what I'm on a 4080 on windows 11 and I'm in double digit fps Windows 10 lol
I really don't get why they think it's in their interests to keep doing this when there are just so many products competing for attention I won't be buying anytime soon Maybe in year at a 50 discount or after two at 75 But only if they do the work to bring it up to a reasonable standard
Anyone buying anything from that turd and unaccountable company known as EA is a complete dolt Triple A titles my ass It's laughable that people keep getting raked over the coals and blame EA year after year They are the problem by supporting that crap company over and over It's not rocket science people EA does not care about you or even about making good games They are shady in every possible way I boycotted them years ago
Let s sell the game for 60
lmao fucking pathetic
Never blame something that works for everyone else
Not enough Ditch the extra game launcher and remove denuvo as well This is a 70 piece of software
So is everyone s fault but EA got it wonder why everyone hates EA
this is so dam funny
Weasel words
They mean buy nvidia A100 and AMD epyc to run this game at 1440p 120fps medium Seems reasonable to me
Ok now we blaming the users of Windows 10
Clowns lol
That's BS EA being EA fuck them
The way this reads you'd think it runs great on low end hardware
Did they consider fixing the game before releasing
Fallen order was horrible at launch and still pretty buggy to this day No excuses from respawn or ea
I mean the performance seems similar to the previous game
This is by far the worst year for PC gaming at the moment lol Basically every game this year was a bad porting or a bad optimized released
What I don t get about these releases is if those patches can be done within few weeks or even days wtf can t they do it during years of development before release
They wanted the money same as always Blame everyone except themselves as they count the cash and think about fixing the bugs in a few weeks Smh
13900ks and 4090 owner here I don t want to even upset myself and try to run this game I will cry knowing I sold my second child in order to build this PC and it can t even run EA Jedi order 67 at more then 30 fps
The problem is that this game is too good for your lowly PCs
each patch requires significant testing So we decided not to test anything Just let us know if it worked
Since w10 is still kind of new you can t blame ea I mean come on who in the world of software qa would consider performance testing on the biggest os It is kind of funny though since m s testing strategy for the last years is you don t need testing stages anymore You can test in production maybe it is just some kind of unholy alliance when both of them come together
They thought they could just throw a PC port together at the last minute Guess they were wrong
Hey if it runs perfectly on L
Classic EA
Yeah sure blame others for your own crap
Are they gaslighting us
I'm so glad I'm over buying games day one or even pre ordering Being a patient gamer is more and more rewarding Not only do I pay WAY LESS for the game but I also get it patched and probably packed with dlc's or expansions or whatever
Never buy a game in the first month or two
Remember folks this bullshit is from the same company that broke a Reddit record for the amount of downvotes Also the irony is that it's also for a Star Wars game too
But Windows official release is 11 and it appears that users are also experiencing issues there
What the fuck So they re blaming US For apparently having under performing cpus with high end gpus
What a bullshit statement performance is even crap on ps5 with dips to low 30s This is unacceptable
I m on Win11 and a 4080 13700k and it still runs like my ass feels after Fat Burger joke stolen from Steam lol
Typical EA bullshit
They have standards
Ah yes it's because we aren't using windows 11 the os known to lead to massive frame rate drops in lots of games I have a 3070 and windows 11 dropped world of warcraft by 20 fps for me This was a year ago so idk if it has suddenly gotten better but this game has surely been in development longer than that
Man I hate this statement so much I have a 3070 ti and have been playing on 4k without many issues 8 hours in I was at the point of being like People must not remember a time where you had to tweak your settings as needed Now I think Nope Im just getting very lucky and this game is a janky mess Well played for reminding me to be better EA Also why they are at it can they add DLSS I'd really appreciate it because FSR just doesnt feel like it helps much
devs blaming hardware for the shitty code they wrote what a joke
Runs lime crap on Windows 11 and Linux too
Terrible Not performing to our standards You're not the EA of the old days your name carries no respect anymore
So it's a console port and they didn't put any money towards optimization for PC but they knew it would sell and they would patch it after the fact once sales started rolling in Same old
Are all of these different pc specification factors not taken into account while they are play testing the game to ensure this doesnt happen I dont know if im the only one but it just seems crazy to me that two major releases in the past month have had terrible pc performance issues on launch These are multi billion dollar corporations and they didnt catch these things
I bet if you put some footage side by side with windows 10 vs 11 it will be very similar
Dear EA I ll test a 5900X and 3080Ti on Windows 10 Then I ll test a 13700K and 4090 on Windows 11 When the performance is exactly the same what say you next
I won't call ryzen 7s and 9s Low End CPUs EA and sadly RESPAWN You suck
This is giving the same energy as how they responded to the Battlefront 2 disaster with the microtransactions EA just keeps digging themselves into a hole with each game
EA for Early Access
I strongly believe that this game is in worse state at launch than Batman Arkham Knight was back then when the game was removed from Steam until fixed Coincidence or not on both cases I was able to claim the game for free I just bought a 7800x3D which allows me to claim this Jedi game and back then I bought a gtx970 that allowed me to claim Batman for free Yes of course blame the OS or the API right Or the users who are using their hardware wrong WTF is happening with the gaming industry Is there any recent AAA release that had no issues at launch in late 2022 early 2023
It's not just on PC on xbox series x it's horrible to Only play 5 works well with the game v xUraYjyUh A v xUraYjyUh A
Series X is horrendous screen tearing every 3 seconds I was regretting not grabbing this on PC and then I see this Seems like it has shit performance everywhere
You've got to understand They're a small indy dev shop and testing on all sorts of out of date platforms like windows 10 or modern hardware that releases less than two years before the game is outside their ability It's quite natural for them to see issues in this scenario and they are clearly not to blame It's the fault of microsoft and Intel Their open and honest apology to the community on behalf of Intel and Microsoft should be applauded
I never expect any different but I loathe that they always make this out as some unexpected situation They're either so incompetent they did 0 actual testing whatsoever or they knowingly released a pile of crap with the intention of fixing it later The latter is far more likely if you ask me They must weigh it up and find releasing garbage and fixing it later is more profitable than delaying
I have windows 11 and game runs like dogshit
Im on w11 same shit Ea bs
Even indie dev's spend time testing their game on countless system configurations but EA a multi billion dollar company can't be bothered to invest the tiniest amount of money into making sure their game runs properly on a massive platform like a PC for it's release So many of you keep accepting this state of affairs and so here we are yet again getting fucked because so many people don't have a consumer backbone This is the company so many of you continue to give 70 100 before they even release their product I wish this time people will learn this lesson about preordering but gaming is filled with so many brainless consumers and companies like EA know they can keep releasing lemons and call it Lemonade
This is their standard
Do these people not play test games
Just give us money
Didn t EA lay off 800 employees last month Pretty sure a some of them were QA testers Now this is the result when you have far less manpower testing out games on various hardware configurations on PC Nothing surprising from EA though
Oh no It's so hard atthose days at least TEST GAMES before release
EA has standards
Such a weird excuse Companies should do a lot more investments in optimizing A well optimized game appeals to a lot more people and gets units sold For example when Digital Foundry puts out their optimized settings and you are able to get a good experience on low end to middle end hardware is a huge plus
Cutting edge multi threaded chipsets checks year Oh I did not know it s 2002
They're actually blaming the software they wrote the game to run on Fucking Christ EA
Here's what this means EA has already published the game Idiots have already pre ordered EA has made it's money and to subdue the backlash they're going to fix the game and at best you'll get stable 60fps That's it EA will call it a day made money stabilized a shit game no point in over committing resources On to the next one This is a pattern now Wild hearts another EA orginal from KoeiTecmo studio which launched earlier this year had the same issues PC performance was horrible in hindsight I'm fully blaming this on the PC ports they use barely got stable 60fps After 4 patches now you'll get 60fps The world moved on Knowing respawn Apex legends with every patch there will be something else that breaks completely This time they will take their time and bring the game to stable 60fps without much bugs hopefully and move on because part of the team is already shifted back to improving Apex legends This is classic EA When Apex legends was starting to go in a state of disarray EA put most of the respawn team on Star wars and kept the game barely alive Now that star wars is out the team is already back on Apex legends You see the cycle EA is maximising output per cost but publishing shit that floats just above the water Who is keeping this trend alive Pre orders early buyers It's all there Don't be surprised if the same shit happens with their Immortals of Aveum coming in a couple of months
our standards are supposedly good but we skimped on PC quality assurance expenditure then again this is YOUR DAMN FAULT for using bad OS or bad hardware noobs Thanks EA that means a lot
That non apology apology sounds more like they're pointing the finger at the customer and laying the blame at their feet Sure Just happens to be certain specific configurations on both the high and low ends
Imagine thinking 45 fpson the high end on a 3070 would be standard And I didn't know my Ryzen 7 3700x was a low end CPU or made for windows 's a shame companies can't just finish their game before they release it like God I miss tho days where u just buy a game for lik GameCube and it just worked can we do tht again like damn
EA has released a statement on Star Wars Jedi Survivor performance on PC places some blame on Windows 10 It sounds more like a statement from Respawn especially considering that they call themself The Star Wars Jedi Team And they say We are committed to fixing
lmfao blaming on windows 10 is fucking hillarious when win 11 and 10 is literally the same
It didn't occur to a seasoned game studio to test for various PC configs prior to shipping Developing for Console is significantly easier because the hardware is fixed but it's well known in the industry PC requires some extra love and attention when it comes to optimization They could have easily QA tested different combinations of hardware to gauge performance Instead they decided to save time and money Don't be fooled they weren't blindsided by this They were aware this could happen and hoped it wouldn't
Yet in the spec requirements on the steam page it recommends windows 10
Valve should start slapping on Early Access label when publishers release garbage like this
LOL they use so many words but say so little The PR team that wrote this clearly don't know much about Our standards Seems to be status Percentage I suppose 100 is a percentage so technically true Cutting edge multi threaded chipsets Did you mean processors Or are you referring to Zen 4 boards with multiple chipsets Doesn't 's having issues on everything regardless of the CPU or the chipset lower performing CPUs I lower performing And which is it You say cutting edge and lower pretty much whatever CPU you have you're screwed So we're back to 100 EA this was about the worst response you could have come up with short of telling people to piss off this is how things are
Companies nowadays have one mentality Release now fix later The problem stems from them not wanting to lose on opportunity cost and risk a launch They would rather make their sales rake in some cash and then pay the devs with that cash to fix the game This way they don't incur more labor while the game is still under development aka they don't want to invest and take a risk at a final product And it's not necessarily the devs' faults it's the marketing team's fault that needs to keep their job by projecting sales estimates and revenue They are using Release now fix later methodology into their predictions I know how this stuff works I work for a large corp as well and it's absolutely filthy The downside with game developing companies is that there's no way to charge them COPQ Cost of Poor Quality all their cash is already secured by pre orders
If it cant run on windows 10 it doesnt deserve 11
its not new that they blame other things because they dont want accept that they SUCK
Who could have predicted how Windows 10 would behave lol
Every AAA studio can write a AAA game under Windows 10 but EA can't Weird How can you even believe this
Lol so they're blaming hardware and windows 10 For issue also happening on 7950x3d and windows 11 face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
popcorn it s fun watching all the PC gamers act like subject matter experts
Unfortunately a 5900x isn't strong enough to go along with a 4090 then
As far as I know these issues aren't limited to PCs Lol What about consoles that are experiencing sub par performance I assume it's not Windows fault that they struggle on PS Which is weird given it's an AMD partnered title so you would assume the best place to play it is on PS5 EA fucked us all by rushing the game out to meet a timeline Now we have to wait for performance patches Respawn looks bad because of it too Look at all the devs don't care memes It's not really their fault Unless they refused to even ask for a time extension to iron out issues
The PR person who green lighted this message is a fucking moron
I played an hour last night and it was running fine for me at 4K High Was a few slight hitches but overall was very playable the entire time no lag or major FPS drops I didn't check what FPS it was at but I suspect it wasn't at 60FPS PC Specs for anyone wondering 3080 10GB 5600 16GB 2666mhz oc'd to 2900mhz Edit got past the first section of the second planet and the game tanked hard
EA we swear it is anything but denuvo
Thank God I went to console gaming I don't have to worry about crap like this anymore
Anything and EVERYTHING but us
I immediately noticed that they didn't give a damn to fix the shader compilation stutters we had dozens of releases with these reported issues and even their previously released title Dead Space remake had it too They also went for the moneyhat and couldn't give the game DLSS support due to that which is a huge mistake The game is also massively performance hungry it should and could run better And these are easily detectable after a few minutes of play These issues have nothing to do with cutting edge hardware or windows lol Tell the truth and say you shipped the game despite well knowing the issues and didn't care enough to fix them for the launch
Surely it's not the virus called denuvo
Calm down people Marketing team is doing their job here it s not devs actually sitting down typing in official responses EA stuck to the release date as a publisher devs weren t ready because games are getting harder to code for But it wasn t delayed Respawn probably had a stressful time recently trying their best for launch and they ll fix the game eventually Give it a few weeks Enjoy the game then Been waiting for a sequel for how long Surely can hold out for a bit longer
Lmao
who believe issues with stuttering get Tried to warn people but they did not listen
Such a lame excuse a blatant lie My PC 10900K and 2080ti My friend's PC 10700K and 3070ti While high end for their released time our CPUs don't have Intel's new big LITTLE core design nor AMD's chiplet and CCXs design Very Low CPU utilization Both tried different variations of settings no change in performance My GPU ran at around 50 This not Windows fault This is entirely on Respawn or whoever was responsible for the PC port and at the end of the day it's EA's fault They didn't delay it and shipped a clearly broken product that looks like nobody tested before launching it
Step 1 Reomove decrappo DRM
gif giphy l2YWBNd18eFbrEzWo I got the game for free AM5 bundle yet I feel I've been robbed Touch EA touch
I will not be upgrading to windows 11 until I'm forced to Lame PR by them for real
How has no one mentioned this one of the first games to be priced 70 USD and they give us a shit 'll wait till it's 10 15 the first one was pretty fun with some real character let
I'm happy they at least addressed it I'm more pissed at EA than respawn since Fallen Order ran great for me besides the Unreal stutters I hope they can pull a CDPR and patch most of this and hopefully they're faster with it too
gif giphy 11vsrRFqhjOcKI
You're gonna suck it up and buy it anyways
It runs like shit on windows 11 with a 4090
Is anybody actually moving to Windows 11 out of choice I mean it doesn't sound terrible but why would you change when 10 works well and still has access to legacy features
EA wants you to have a feeling of pride and accomplishment when you upgrade your PC with only the highest end equipment and can THEN play our shit game
Tbf at this point it's the fault of the players for even buying EA game straight after release Once people stop doing that and only then will EA maybe stop releasing unfinished games But yeah keep buying EA games on release I guess the next one will be better right
Literally not even going to read this just going to assume that it's some generic non statement about how they hear the players and are working diligently to address the issues All of course without giving any timeframe or mentioning any option of recourse refunds for any of the customers they screwed over Just another generic public apology on a flat color background where the companies STILL can't help but plaster every relevant logo all over the image to get that extra bit of free advertising out there Talking a lot while saying nothing because no one will ever 100 own up and handle these things like they need to be handled Of course as I mentioned I didn't read it So maybe I'm way off Someone else can let me know I guess
Wait we were just told you just needed to buy a Radeon to futureproof 6800s have 16GB What happened Time to toss those 16GB Radeons into the trash boys All of you that chose an also inadequate 16GB over NV's feature set and quality got hustled big time
I took one look at the gameplay trailer for this game and instantly knew this was a dumpster
Forgive me if I'm not keeping up these days but I've written off Windows 11 thus far What on Earth are they talking about in regard to chipsets designed for Windows 11
You spelled Places zero blame on Windows 10 and blames it on people buying PCs with Pre Alpha quality hardware and software because they're dumb and falsely think NVIDIA cares about their customers enough to bring meaningful upgrades to the consumer market wrong The reality is these are the consequences of a monopoly AKA NVIDIA
This statement made me less smarter And here is why 7950X3D 4090 windows 11 still only 70 96 Fps 1440p
lol literally all PC players at least have the balls to admit it
Right definitely not Denuvo You guys need to remove Windows
Another game for getting as pirate copy
I ve been hearing it s just the first planet that s not optimized
They're not wrong though ADL and RPL were designed to work best on W11 with the Scheduler and Thread Director If you stick with windows 10 then that's on you as a user
Fuck of EA im not touching Windows 11
This is a sub par apology that they failed to take immediate action on Not entirely unexpected from the company that forced predatory P2W gambling trash into a previous Star Wars title in 2017 If they wanted their product to be well received they should've tested the damn thing more before releasing it so it didn't end up a piece of garbage
Honestly I don t care about the performance I was having a blast playing at 45 fps
Why are people even buying this shit the vicious cycle
How about a discount for PC players I'd buy it for half price right now in it's backed up state But then again they'd make a profit
None of my friends nor I had any issues whatsoever We're on windows 10 on 7900x and 7900xtx Just cause it's on Reddit doesn't mean 100
They are optimizing games with dlss and fsr activated by default
High end GPU coupled with low end CPU There's nothing to wonder about it so many are so so nonsensical wanting to believe that a low end CPU can sustain a high end GPU They aren't aware that only by a balance real performance can be achieved
So first to be fair I have not looked at the FPS counter while playing the game However the game runs well enough on my machine to be perfectly playable I really don't have any deal breaking complaints I'm running Windows 10 and using an nVidia RTX 2080 Ti on an Intel i7 5960X CPU These were top end parts in their day but their day is long since past Am I doing something wrong here All the online complaints left me expecting a horrible first play experience but that didn't happen Edit Apparently admitting the game is playable tends to irritate people Though FWIW I did go ahead and fire up an FPS counter While running around Coruscant I was getting around 40fps give or take Once on the Mantis that counter went up to 60fps and stayed there though the graphics settings likely capped it there
I fucking hate the internet Yes the game has some problems but they put lots of energy in it for us the star wars fans And they will patch it There is too much negativity and critics for what it is Fuck the internet Fuck haters
Game runs fine in 4k Epic settings 60fps on my AMD 7600x 6800xt W11 I know I'm in the NVidia sub and I acknowledge the issue is prevalent but this game came bundled with my CPU so I'm glad it works There's hitching in the cutscenes and the game has to 'optimize' itself every time it boots but it runs miles better than RDR2
pC mAsTeR rAcE
No thats not blame on windows 10 thats blame on USERS having processors that support a particular core hiearchy not being supported by windows 10 choosing to use windows 10 instead of yaknow installing 11 and then customizing out the annoying shit
Running i9 9900k with a 1080 TI no issues so far Game is awesome
Most people just want to be able to run the game on antique hardware Or they bought a 40 series card but still have a 7 year old processor My game runs fine I also run windows 11 which is free to all windows 10 owners lol So while I m sure the game isn t perfect and the most optimized If you actually run NEW hardware and actually use the most recent OS then your experience isn t going to be 100 bad like most in here are saying Most people just don t know how to properly setup a pc nor even have the money to have a decent rig Or they have other shit bogging their pc down that they aren t even aware of Also you don t need to run the game in 4k native lol Like it s a hefty game 1440p looks great Nearly max but not max settings look great and leave plenty of headroom And I never dip below like 90fps at the most and mainly stay at 120 Bunch of whiners Nothing is perfect
This is after they delayed the game so they could make sure that it was in fact up to their standards Shame EA keeps rushing product
Did they not test under these conditions I mean there are weird configurations out there for sure but these examples sound pretty common
This statement is for stock holders who don't know anything and not customers of the game They knew this was going to happened that's why the review embargo is day of
Thanks EA and in return I will continue to monitor the price tag and don't get it until a good 50 discount
Thanks for your money upfront on a game we wanted to make but didn't Your funding ensures we have labor hours to finish the game and won't anger our shareholders
Guess what release the fucking game AFTER fixing these things instead of releasing a broken game and then patch it to hell Tiple A gaming is a joke
EA keeps failing every AAA title Same shit was with battlefield 2042 took them nearly a year to fix everything crucial
I wander if 5900x and rtx 3080ti finally counts as lower performing
Sounds like a cringy youtube apology
You re telling me they didn t test their product on gaming PCs
We are too stupid to test our game on Windows 10 or with several different hardware configurations
Remember when game companies tested multiple hardware and different Windows versions Pepperidge farm remembers
Because they want you to buy a 20 gigabyte vram card looking at you AMD or a used 3090 for 1440p instead of optimizing the game AMD must ve paid a ton of money even the Last Of Us Part 1 fixed their game EA Respawn are blaming the consumer When almost no consumer has a 20 gigabyte card or gpu Even the 7800x3d is cpu bottlenecked
I am on Windows 11 facing the exact same issues and on Jedha there is an area where the game crashes with the error DXGI ERROR DEVICE HUNG every single time which makes it impossible to proceed in the game I reinstalled the GPU drivers all updates are installed and this happend to me a total of 6 times this far
Is there a difference in running this game on Windows 11 versus Windows 10 in terms of optimization
No no it's actually the power cables in our walls that makes the game perform like shit obviously
The least they could ve ended the convo with is May the force be with you
So did they not test their shit on windows 10 Lmao
Bla Bla Bla if we are interested we May fix it bla bla bla
Yeeah lotsa empty talk and redirecting Tell me once this is fully patched and 20 in a sale More games then time anyways Fuck the shitty ports and unfinished releases
we are aware The classic formula followed by every dev including TLOU Witcher etc etc
HOW WAS THIS SHIPPED
There is absolutely no way that their QA team wouldn't have caught this during testing I'll bet my left nut that the QA builds are completely devoid of Denuvo DRM and didn't see this kind of performance internally This stinks of typical EA upper management shoving the game out the door with no consideration to the actual quality of the experience
If only there was a 30 year trend of OS adoption rates that EA could use as a reference for these types of situation Then EA couldn t use such a BS blame the users for the piss poor release of what is probably stellar work from the artists who created it If I worked on this game I would be pissed off On flip side now they can say the patch is a highly anticipated update for PC users Marketing spin at its finest
Someone find the EA rep and get him to make a comment on this A new world record is waiting
this reads like every other EA 'whoops we dont know how to optimize for PC' statement they have ever released
As usual
How do you turn off anti analysing Anyone know where the ini file is for this
Lies damn lies and obfuscation
i'm gonna buy it just to refund it fuck EA
For a certain 1 of our users who play on a potato they can't tell the difference between 5fps and 10fps Mission accomplished
Oh ffs can't star wars go to a functioning company already Please I miss Jedi knight
They are blaming W10 Then they should've ONLY put Windows 11 on the box for requirements
Lol you they trolling with that response
Good thing it runs great on windows XP
Hopefully they'll have some of the issues fixed by the time it goes on sale for 50 off
We are aware that Star Wars Jedi Survivor isn't performing to our
I call bullshit Game runs like ahit on all platforms
You lying fuckers You knew exactly in what state this game will be on the release date and you're playing polite boy right now Best guess is that It'll end up with adding DLSS and Frame Generation personally I'm waiting for it with my 4080 but I would laugh at the same time because of the laziest way to increase the performance xD
Pathetic
You poors obviously don't have Epyc cores and SLI A100's Sucks to be you
EA puts two types of DRM in their new shiny game Complains about Windows
For some Same textbook message lmao
Ok Devs its unpaid Crunch time to fix your shit Ignore the fact that you told us it wasn't optimized EA slack channel probably
Are they trying to say a Ryzen 9 is low tier
Thanks for being paying beta testers Dead Space remake is also still a stuttery mess
Denuvo and EA's shitty optimization is the issue
Ohhhhh p s off that's a bs excuse to saying it was rushed EA didn't think the first would do good it was a hit and rushed a second one then blames people's good hardware on the problem they dont even have dlss ffs
E A Challenged at everything
I can t even get past the broken configuration menus so they definitely have more issues than just performance
Blame users operating systems and components Corporate cope face with tears of joy
And people still preorder buy games the same day they are released Who is at fault here
So does it run better on Windows 11
Ahh yes the game that boycotts itself
i got a 4090 and a 13900k and i still only get 120 fps on 1080p rt off and high settings its a joke i also have win 11 so this means nothing
Wait EA has standards
Meanwhile re4 remake runs on anything rolling on the floor laughing
This game was EA s chance to redeem themselves at least to some degree It was really hyped it topped the Steam charts even before it came out people were really excited Then the game actually released and we got this mess nice going EA you blew your chance
There is a single comprehensive solution to PC performance TEST THE GAME BEFORE YOU RELEASE IT Remember when game developers HIRED PAID AND PROMOTED game testers Games HAD to ship in working order or it was a guaranteed flop The patching system has ruined the end user experience due to lackadaisical planning and execution on the game industry
I didn t know what the term gaslighting meant before today Now I know
I managed to get a PS5 roughly 1 5 years ago instead of going for a GPU upgrade for my gaming PC The more time passes the better that decision looks in hindsight
I was having fun playing force unleashed instead
lol i hate EA too but they aren t placing the blame on Windows 10 they are saying what they have diagnosed Y all need to relax if this were the Disco Elysium team you d be giving them slack
It's interesting how these types of responses just sort of ignore that PC gamers have literally dozens of tools and contrary examples at their disposal to demonstrate that said response is 30 seconds to find multiple examples of people running a 4090 and 13900K in Windows 11 running between 12 59fps and this is the hill you're choosing to die on This ain't console world EA We can actually figure out pretty fast when a company is making things up and dodging accountability
I blame the players for still buying EA EA standards are on par with EA game buyers standards Thats like a guy still dating with a girl that keeps openly cheating on
Sorry guys not sure what the issue is Works fine on my 3090 smirking face
As soon as I see We are It's all clear for me You fucking trashed it Also a percentage is a fucking understatement Why release it like this you schmucks
For example players using cutting edge multi threaded chipsets lmao who comes up with this stuff and how old is their computer
This is such a non apology They released this knowing full well there were problems and didn't say anything I don't really care cos I stopped buying games day 1 long ago but I feel bad for those that were excited and will probably try and persevere with the issues
Curious it's mostly Windows 11 who has the shit performance on gaming
My 4090 ain t hitting over 100 fps on 4k tf going on ea
gif giphy xTiIzL9Btjx9hegHT2 So I'll wait some time and buy it on discount then Setting isthereanydeal to bellow 20 then D
This is the first game charging us 70 too Hehehehe
How about actually test the games before they release
Hire the devs from cd projektred They did an amazing job fixing cyberpunk 2077
I mean if you're using a
Players using cutting edge multi threaded chipsets designed for Windows 11 Wtf Do these morons think Windows 10 users pre ordered next gen processors for Windows 11 or something I understand Windows 11 utilizes hardware differently than Windows 10 but there's no way in hell they're telling the truth here
Hey It ran well on their premade version on their studio so it means that there is something wrong with us and not them S
Runs like shit on Windows 11 with a 10700k 5ghz and a 3080 I usually sit at like 40fps at 1440p rtx off Changing any of the settings dosent seem to do anything GPU usage sits at 50
No way shit PC console performance And EA Who could
these dudes are the whole circus
EA really trying to throw the blame on the OS No it's not that It's the game itself It was rushed to publishing and is an unfinished wreck
So would the game run fine on a 13700kf with a 4090
Pffft I m using a 5900X 32GB ram and 4090FE playing on Win11 and I m getting poor performance too you tools EA always trying to cop out and blame someone else This statement would ve gone over better if it was just We re sorry we are working on it instead of making up weak bullshit to blame it on someone else And it s weak because your own damn teams should ve been testing this kind of shit
They could start by adding DLSS
That's ridiculous You mean to tell me the scheduler is being pointed at Come on
I know what happened to beta testing but what the hell ever happened to alpha testing
Exact same shit EA said with BF2042
DON T BUY FROM EA Come on guys you know this
Eat shit EA
K Good luck with that EA See you when your game is 2 on Steam
Sick of this bull crap now Near every PC release has something wrong
EA We had no idea some of you idiots still use windows 10 or CPUs
AAA studios after taking your 70 gif giphy l41m4ODfe8PwHlsUU
Hmm might have to upgrade to 11 It's still free right
I m really really REALLY getting sick of terrible PC ports Everybody needs to try a whole lot harder TLOU Part 1 was a dumpster fire nice to see this one is too SO many games launch on PC broken it s just hard to count at this point It s unacceptable Maybe they should be hiring people who know WAY more about computers so they don t just rush a piece of hot garbage out just to meet a deadline only to have to come back out and make a statement apologizing for how bad it sucks
Gigachad
Sadly EA will survive this and gamers will buy the third one too on release day
Release and then fix This is the new way now for ports
Oh shit a moment of silence for day one beta testers
Is this the same shit for brains PR department that tried to sell us pride and accomplishment Wonder how that went for them
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for upgrading their operating system
If a PC with an RTX 4090 combined with a Ryzen 5950x can t even run a game properly at the settings that it s been specifically designed for ie max settings Then the game should ve been fucking delayed instead of being released in this bad of a state and the blame shouldn t be pinned on us
Seeing stuff like the state of this game upon release among others released thus far this year alone truly makes you miss the days of physical only launches when companies only had that one chance to get it right Not send out a broken mess with plans to fix it later
I refunded Absolute trash performance on PC
Small indie dev studio selling 70 100 unfinished and unoptimized 's back to sailing the high seas once
This PR communication is so lame that I'm actually surprised that Bill Gates wasn't mentioned
in resume yes we know just remember you are beta tester stop complaining and keep working
Game was developed in record time person facepalming Can we stop this shit please Stop rushing shit out and killing devs
None of this applies to me and the game still runs like ass Even after disabling SMT
Looks at all my other games that run fine on windows
Alright cool Refund for me while I play something else
The blame is theirs if a big game like war frame cyberpunk and other massive titles can run on Windows 10 It s you
The blame is theirs if a big game like war frame cyberpunk and other massive titles can run on Windows 10 It s you
What a load of shit indie developers seemingly have no problem optimising games across multiple platforms yet multimillion dollar companies can't Fuck right off
Yea yea Proven OS Or new game
Dear Mickey Mouse How many times does EA have to make you look stupid before you let someone else take a stab Best BastardOps
I have no idea what goes into optimizing a game But how is there not just a standard playbook for that now How is the architecture of all these games so different that you can have two games with similar graphical fidelity but a huge variance in performance
How is it windows 10 or nvidias fault yoy have been developing the game on systems that have been in place during the entire lifetime of your project The only one to blame is yourselves ea
First day patch must have applied I installed and ran it for the first time day and now I'm stuck on a terrace somewhere in Courasant beaming face with smiling eyes It didn't stutter too much getting there On 7950x and 4090 neither maxed out speed or temps But you can see when it stumbles along
If they prefer to alienate and embarrass window 10 gamers they're in for a shock Gamers stick together and there are far more win 10 users than win 11 i'd imagine Another cyberpunkesque launch You don't even need to carry out extensive research Just look at steam data to have a reasonably good idea of most pc setups and test
Yes No You can shove it
isn't performing to our standards Then why did you release it
Lol Placing blame on windows What a fucking lame and idiotic cop out excuse It is their developer studio that is to blame Also EA themselves
Performance on my 12900k 4090 has actually been slightly better than Hogwarts Legacy so there's that
Anytime I see a big game studio make a game I just say bad and move on I saw this game with so many pre orders and knew this was gonna be baddd
typical EA gaslighting blame someone else for flaws entirely on EA's part yet another reason why i refuse to play anything from this shit company
Blaming win10 11 but console is the horrible too
These guys are full of it They act like they didn't know that the game was running like dog water Come on you have people testing the game out on PC You guys just care about the consoles running good and then you focus on patches for the pc It's the same story every time a big game like this comes out Own up to the issue and stop blaming other ppl
Clowns man clowns look at Atomic Heart developed by a new small company and it looks and plays amazing
master race
gif giphy l41m4ODfe8PwHlsUU
Ah the obscure OS called Windows I guess their QA department don t have it
How was this released in this state Did they just see how choppy the experience was and went this fine ship it WTF
At most windows 11 has like a 30 market share in Windows There is 0 chance they did not test Windows 10 They just chose to not delay
It s all most like triple A means dogshit game
These morons pretend that it runs well on consoles lmao
It's almost like shipping a game to support more than one specific hardware configuration console actually takes work
Respawn will always respawn
What a fucking cop out
I've been waiting a long time for this Laughs in console
I never understand how the games are made on PC s yet the final releases are trash on Pc
That's the reason why I wait at least 1 2 years before buying new games At this time you'll have enough testing and patches to make a better choice
Definitely couldn't do any testing on windows 10 before launch Why would they do that
EA is notorious for botching PC releases of their games They never fixed the issues with ME Legendary Edition on PC hence why I quit playing it Square Enix is another studio that can't seem to release a competent port on PC Case in point Final Fantasy X HD FFX HD for PC has issues with CTDs during gameplay doesn't even support surround sound audio like it did on the original PS2 version Instead we got 2 channel stereo the other for PC development support I remember a time when games were made on PC then ported to console Now they port from console to PC which has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster to say the least
It's EA I would have been shocked if it finished in either a finished or functional state
Testing probably takes longer on different setups because they keep getting locked out from denuvo s
buy console is the real message from chip supplier
Sooo the game runs fine on win 11
FWIW I ve been reading Reddit on this game for the last 24 hours and having a semi freak out about the PC port being crap and WHY THE F did I pre order it I finally got to play it when I got home and it s not perfect but some of this seems to be blown out of proportion I have a 13900K 4080FE 32gb RAM running Windows 11 Built the PC myself a couple months ago first time I ve ever built one With the settings all set to Epic and Raytracing turned on I was putting out around 75 FPS fairly consistently the first hour or so I got to play It IS stuttering it s annoying but it is still very playable I m not giving them a pass but if you went by Reddit you would think that it was unplayable even with any hardware
Why do they even bother with these statements when everyone knows the real reason why the game is broken Literally EVERYONE knows this is BS yet they just keep putting them out for each broken game they released too early
We all can tell that devs don t play their own game If they did they would know it doesn t work
Imagine thinking that the OS somehow accesses chipsets on the motherboards
But hey at least they impressed their shareholders by releasing it while its not ready If only the automotive industry could impress shareholders by releasing incomplete cars
But at least you got those sweet pre order
Imagine the sense of pride and accomplishment you will get from actually finishing the game at 30 fps though
Time for a witch hunt lol
EA s business model is to ship out buggy trash and only spend money on bug fixes if refunds get too high
I m on windows 11 with a 7900x CPU with an RTX 4080 and I still frequent fps drops and stutters I found a fix for it on Nexus Mods so hopefully it works I ll try it out in the morning
Check out the gas light
How is the performance on consoles
Being in the industry of agile iteration planning project management I sympathize with all the engineers involved right now They probably have a lot of work ahead of them to code configure test pilot deploy full release and it s stressful AF to know your entire IP didn t stick the landing because it wasn t tested on the significant amount of scenarios Maybe Sony has the right method Release first on a single configuration platform and then follow up with PC
These are not the Notes you are looking for at this time
This is the main reason publishers like EA pushed the digital model First even when the game doesn't run there is a large percentage of players that will wait for a fixable patch Two the amount of people that do a refund will cost them less than if they had to refund physical copies They weighed those pros and cons and found it affordable to release half baked game digitally
ea moment
It s hard to optimize a game Cmon man game studios have been doing it for a long ass time
We have no idea what we are doing EA
The game just hogging all the v ram available
Honestly my performance on windows 10 wasn't awful certainly within the playable range but it keeps freezing when doing random shit like opening chests and it freezes so hard the only way I've found to be able to close the game is to restart my entire computer
This why you test games on different configurations if you claim to support them Just excuses
Mmmh they could have said that we didn't use our PC properly or that we didn't hold the PC case properly and that it disrupted the flow of energy through it that it wouldn't be as pathetic as this
Yes everything else is at fault except for their own incompetence Do these companies even play their own games anymore
I havent played the game but I want to know what settings are the people running the game with the highest end gpus like the 4090 not just game settings but os and other things like cpu and stuff
Throwing untested shovelware out the door and blaming everyone but themselves Stop pre ordering games people
Classic EA
So they started porting
The game isn't performing as per their standards but thru are still selling it And laughing at the dumb customers who fail on the same trick over and over
You know if they removed denuvo it would save the game But they won't do that
The good thing s at least they Tell the truth
So what you re saying is that you didn t test it on Win10
Stop pre ordering They ll just keep taking fat dumps on all of us and releasing rubbish that can be fixed later They ve lost respect for their customers
A game by ea not working at launch Shocker
Devs didn't have access to a windows 10 machine Sorry guys
chipsets designed for Windows 11 WAT
Here's an idea just fucking remove denuvo
Pathetic the AAA status of todays games better wait for 1 more year since release to have decent hardware and that the bugs are all fixed and not released in debug mode
Remove the DRM that eats away at performance lol
Typical EA incompetence
The non physical era has only managed to bring unfinished games to the
Another game that releases with subpar performance What a time to be a PC enthusiast
Genuine question here Can anyone tell me what direct x12 is for as I always assumed it was the api that talks to all the hardware for gaming other purposes
The incompetence is real here
Damn I put everything on Epic settings and the resolution on 4K and FSR on performance and minus some stutters here and there mostly outside I could play for hours on my Ryzen 9 with 64Gb RAM RTX 3070 It is doable and needs some patches indeed but it's not comparable with hogwarts legacy or the last of us part 1 those were and are still a performance disaster but Jedi Survivor isn't that bad on 4K with FSR on performance
Your standards are pretty shitty to begging with
And yet it is still getting 8 10 in reviews
Not acceptable They have a QA team and they still releassd the game in this state It shows how much they care about customers as this is EA I bet Respawn told EA to delay the game with a few weeks or months but
In an age where the same version of a game is ported to multiple platforms this is bound to happen especially when these games are mainly developed with current gen consoles in mind
It's actually because it add to the difficulty and brings you pride and accomplishment upon finishing it Also no DLSS Denuvo is an easy skip for me until I can have access to it for free
our dev team hasn't been able to reproduce this bug on our XP and 7 workstations so the fault is on Microsoft and Windows 10 for sure
When do EA not shit the bed
Me who preordered BF 2042 Hey I saw this one before
But we don t have enough VRAM Games like this are the issue now a days Lazy developers are no excuse Hell look at destiny 2 the game barely uses 3 gigs of vram at maxed settings
So is the new excuse blaming Windows series S Seems lazy
So tired of the Minimally Viable Product development Every release nowadays is a Beta
It s like people never learn Every time EA releases a new game you guys complain that the game isn t working as it supposed to Every time When are you going to learn to wait to see how the game perform before making the purchase It s the same bullshit every time
It runs like shit on my PS5 too I own it on both PC and PS5 I got it for free with my 7800X3D but already purchased on PS5 and downloaded so can't return Anyway PS5 on performance mode has tons of FPS drops and stutters specifically transition from cutscenes to gameplay drops to 30 45 fps happen frequently I've not experienced this with any other game this generation on console performance mode has been pretty consistent across the board On my PC it runs surprisingly well but the denuvo stutters are still there and sporadic Ironically I experience them less than on console 3080 TI and 7800X3D running it on high RT and FSR off getting around 60 80 fps at 1440p
I never pre order or buy in the first week anymore no matter how badly I like a game There's always the day one patch and then a bunch of patches after that That's even getting to be true on the CONSOLES
EA is such a terrible company
Clowns Refund the game if you haven't already
Again Doom Eternal with full ray tracing is butter smooth on my 8700k and 3080 at 1440p with no DLSS This is just a poor game
Fix the memory leak There's got to be one
Lolololol
100 is blamed for EA QC and never tests on Windows 10 because to save more budget rolling on the floor laughing
So just like the first game they never
Their statement should have just been We re sorry for this bullshit we sold you
Yeah just tried this quit after the intro scene Jumping between 18 FPS and 51 every second This game should have been a 2024 release
lmao EA game pre purchase crew getting what they signed up for y'all have nobody to blame but yourselves
Is the same story in the last years unfinished games untested poor performance or random crashes not only EA but people still buying asap Is what you get so deal with it
I love how no one takes responsibility for their actions these days
Well it s terrible on Windows 11 too so
The first one still runs like shit
I think it s really cool of them to allow entry into an open beta for a small entry fee how kind of them let me know when the full release is
still not buying until EA finishes the game
Fix keymapping too idiots Not accessible friendly at all
Do or do not
The Star Wars Jedi Team This is why the Sith exist
I'm just gonna keep saying this We need Direct Storage asset streaming implementation in PC games And we need to ditch mechanical hard drive disks for the devs sake
I think EA forgot they published BF 2042 in a alpha state rolling on the floor laughing
13700k 3080 'd expect playing at 3440x1440 ultra wide around 80 90fps Never saw these 40fps dips and so on that the reviewers are talking about
So why release it
so hate it cause theres no dlss lol and made my view distance shadow to a high to low settings and the rest is high or
Ive played enough bliz activision games apparently this is just costing them enough money they care I finally gave up on warzone 2 the other day im done spending money with them
My computer flat out refuses to run the fucking game It starts and just stops
I hope nobody eats this This is blatantly false
Naw dude if you bought this game you need to refund it
They act surprised Knowing full well they only worked on getting it to run on consoles and threw the pc development at another team
I was going to buy the game on launch good thing I waited lol
I really am not sure what the major issue is here I played the game for 3 hours last night running on a 3070 and outside of some minor stuttering during large environment transitions I haven t had any issues
Stop being poor Nvidia
What a crock Shouldn t have released in this state I planned to get it on PC but changed my mind because of the mess I got it on PS5 instead I have to say I m not happy with the performance there either Messed up HDR frame rate drops screen tearing and it crashed about 15 minutes into the game Not cool
I really wish they posted this with their reddit account
Thats all these people get is a sorry ass apology They wasted money on PRE ORDERS and they don't even get any free DLC bundle that will eventrually be released No some monies back All your game testers failed to address any bug issues and launched the game Now people out of money for poor customer serivce Glad I never waste money on newely released games Best to wait when they're 12 dollars or ends up being a free give away No thanks
How does this happen Don't thiey beta test
I was on windows 11 and have a very powerful computer well above what should be needed to play this game smoothly and still refunded it to play on ps5
Using cutting edge multi threaded chipsets for windows 11 Are they blaming e cores I've heard of cases where games straight up performed worst because of them and disabling the e cores fixed said games
Garbage
You guys dont have phones and Windows 11 What a shitty response
At least is doesn't crash or have as many bugs as mw2 does grinning squinting facegrinning squinting facezany face
Bethesda sweating reading this statement
so they didnt test the game on high end pc components i dont know how i should feel about that
It ran like shit on my 13900KS and 4080 got a steam refund
Fuck EAt shit
Funny way to say 'We didn't test it properly on Windows 10 '
Mine works fine and don t have a crazy setup man shrugging the game is awesome
I still don't understand why these games are being made for console first PC is literally their largest demographic If you take out the Switch which most AAA games don't release on PC is well over half of their sales pushing towards 2 3 I also fail to understand how a system that meets or exceeds the recommended specs of the game could possibly run it poorly I don't think there's as much to this story as developers would like us all to believe
It's everyone else's fault but ours Have you tried updating your drivers
Damn i am absolutely shocked that EA gave us a unfinished product
I'm curious Was this message written by ChatGPT or was the entire game
EA stays with the fumbles
Wow I just made a post on a pc sub trying to find out why Jedi survivor won t run on my 1000 dollar gaming pc I thought it had something to do with the recent install I did I got a notification from nvidia saying I need to update my drivers Since I did that other games crash and graphic s randomly glitch and do not fix unless I restart So it turns out this is a huge issue with the game Thank goodness it s not my pc you d think they d have known about this before hand Anyone know where I can stay up to date on this
just saw DF video on the ps5 version its so called performance mode is mostly at 45 50 fps and its native resolution is below 720P which FSR upscales to 1440P 's no way to turn it off on console which imo is stupid So if the game is running sub 720P and cant hit stable 60 fps it explains why the pc version is so bad ps5 uses ZEN 2 cores for its cpu which is pretty much mid range in terms of current gen pc hardware i was really close in buying this for my ps5 being that it seems that there is no stuttering on console just poor fps while pc has shader and traversal stutter but im glad i waited im not paying 70 bucks for a game running at sub 720 p and cant hit stable 60 fps
Can anyone help me because I play on Xbox series s and I don t have the option to play performance mode
What a load of shit watching youtube Benchmark Boy with a 4090 and 13900k get 53 fps
Sometimes like in Microsoft Flight simulator 2020 for example they really struggle to incorporate newest graphics card drivers it's a driver thing once downgrade to an older driver let's say november 2022 nvidia drivers it should be has the game is intented to play It worked for other games
I'm running Win 11 and still have the same issues as someone running Win 're game and stop trying to blame users
Well they recommend Windows 10 under the system requirements section on Steam face with rolling eyesman facepalming
Games are always coming out half complete but I have to say I have become a console gamer as it seems that the industry is more interested in consoles and prioritising that market as its larger due to more financially accessible for most people Consoles have great graphics these days take up less space and run so well on TV these days especially if you do your homework on the TV input lag etc
Lol Fuck EA the only issue here is EA's shit product It's beyond me why anyone would give that company any money
significant testing but release the game in that state nice testing
Can't buy an EA Game and then complain that they do EA Things
am i the only one that owns a pc and starts thinking about getting a ps5 just for titles like that fps games for pc but games like these elden ring harry potter etc on ps5 just more optimized
I'm using a Ryzen 7 7700x and AMD Rx 6750 on windows 10 I only had a problem with the game once where the frames dropped to 10 FPS but restarting the game fixed the issue Other than that it runs like a dream at 60fps 1440p HDR
Idek why people play this garbage Jedi outcast is a better Star Wars game than anything since the battlefront 2 2008
high end GPUS coupled with lower performing CPUs My performance with a 13900K 4090 and 64GB of DDR5 was just 'ING REASON JEDHA IS CRASHING FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS THINGS Merrin 'ing 't I was stuck on that planet before too trying to leave for the first time And when we had to return I'm now forever stuck I can only cuss so much on crash reports before I'm off doing something I hate to say it but it's sad that I have to actually stick up for Epic on this one because they've delivered an actual great Star Wars experience in so many years as opposed to the drivel that EA has launched in the last decade I loved SWG we got SWTOR which was a buggy mess and ultimately was a crapshoot compared to the game I played for over 7 years I loved the original Pandemic Games version of B 120 for BF2042 I asked for a refund the very day before actual release I had to wait almost 4 months before they finally came back and said I earned too many achievements even though I didn't play AFTER Nov 't fault BF Bad Company and Bad Company 2 I played both when I was still brand new in the military I received Survivor for free because I built one of my sisters a new PC with an AMD 7xxx processor and the game was bundled and she wasn't interested Glad I didn't spend money this time even as a long Star Wars but even as a PC enthusiast that always upgrades yearly I can't condone whatever the heck they're doing in house I received this for 'm WHAT ARE YOU DOING EA
While i highly dislike EA Microsoft dropped the ball on windows 10 handling of E cores P cores Time for EA to natively support Linux
Def not a windows 10 issue I m on windows 11 with these problems
They can keep their AAA trash I'll probably buy it for 4 99 when it will be properly optimized
100 is a percentage
They struggled mightily not to use their standard for a small percentage verbiage
The percentage of users who are refunding the game is close to costing us more than it cost to make the port so we'd like you all to consider not refunding for a vague future promise
This has been a terrible year for PC gaming releases I d rather wait and have studios get it right than be sold on a half baked game
Yes Runs perfectly for me so yes
Some people are having no issues but most are
Definitely a percentage of PCs this year Also it s morbin time
For exactly 1 amount of people no more or less
Yes considering it's one of the games of all times it does match those statements
They tested without Denuvo s maybe
To be fair if they don't perform significant testing of the patch they risk making the terrible performance more terrible
Yeah Then people treat them as heroes when the games are finally fixed Every patch release notes with a million of fixes for issues that shouldn't have been there in the first place
If it was a small company I would understand not playtesting with a lot of hardware but a company like EA should have damn near every combination of parts available to them Also knowing that the majority of players stick with Windows 10 shouldn't be a surprise to them
Cause lawyers the are afraid of getting held accountable by their shareholders It's the same shit they did with cyberpunk Glad I didn't buy this game Haven't even played the first part yet Star wars kinda sucked the last year's I didn't even watch book of boba Fett or the last season of Mando
As we've been seeing over the years most gamers are total suckers who'll eat up anything associated with an IP they like regardless of quality
Testing is like the most important aspect of software development I'm not gonna blame them for testing I blame EA and Disney for rushing a broken product
Wait games are supposed to be tested before release same with patches This is news to me with how some game companies don t give a shit
To be fair PC is a mess of configurations that are difficult to fully test HOWEVER the comments that this was developed in record time lends me to believe this could have been prevented Also it is EA and we have 500 reasons to trust them
Obviously they test on one specific high end test rig and figured everyone else would be ok
We're done testing on this 4090 and 7950x3d with a top of the line ramkit and the fastest nvme
Other games can come out with patches within a week this is just them saying don't expect anything anytime soon because we have no idea what we are doing
Just a reminder that the last patch for Hogwarts legacy came exactly 52 days ago lol warner just gave up on that title
I read it as it works on too many computers without issues because if it ain't broke EA will break it
I can't wait to use this line in my next performance review at work
Honestly the most insane thing is they originally planned to release this on March 17th
Do they even have standards
We are aware that Star wars jedi survivor isn't preforming to our standards Honestly it seems this applies to pretty much any AAA game on PC To me it feels like that is the norm
It's EA of course they don't
It's performing exactly to their standards The ones which the have met time and time again
That whole second paragraph reads like they're blaming their customers
There is just no way they didn't notice the awful performance If they didn't I wanna know what nasa pc they have Probably borrowed the shit piloting elons rockets
Did they really have the many thousands of possible configurations of PCs as a test bed to confirm these issues before the release Pretty sure a lot of games out there have bugs or performance issues on first release Obviously this is more wide spread but i highly doubt a company like EA wants bad press on purpose
Ah The We hear you press release Who could have predicted this
Speaking of standards does the game have to go through THX certification
EA using the word standards made me chuckle I so wish we could have a boycott of anything EA until they stopped taking the pee out of their customer base Because that is all they do
Fallen order wasn t much better and Apex has been in poor state ever since it came out Respawn is just a really bad dev team
If only they had changed the release date to May 4th to fix things
Who writes this shit It feels like they are so out of touch
Your releases set your standards These are the current Respawn and EA standards
They had to meet the deadlines It's not all the developers fault
They are saying using new CPUs on Win10 causes issues but they also recommend Win10 This must mean that using older CPUs on Win10 will get you good performance thumbs upthumbs up It s the only logical explanation
Ooof
i wonder could the game requirements they published be considered misleading the consumers under the law given its current state Like if GM released a car that they say can do 2000 miles with a full tank and then it barely manages to do half of that
please dont ask us to know what we are doing
We're not going to take the blame so it must be your junky 3k PC's or your shitty operating systems
Either they're downplaying the number of players affected or they truly don't have a grasp on what's causing these problems I really hope it's the former Oh it is 100 intentionally downplaying the severity and scope of the issue One interesting thing I saw with the Dead Space Remake was that in a Reddit post commenting on a similar issue they actually edited a post and you could see this in action comment info The PC patch from today didn't address anything specifically for this issue but if If you're still experiencing stuttering AFTER TODAY'S PATCH would you please comment on this thread with Your PC specs Whether Dead Space is installed on an HDD or SSD Do you have anything running alongside the game while this issue crops up Any PC diagnostics you can provide Any videos of what you're experiencing Oh the patch didn't do anything for this issue Wait that sounds 's add a bit more to insinuate this patch does address the problem without explicitly saying it and hell we'll chuck in some comments to suggest it's an edge case we need help identifying Whilst we're at it I guess we may as well infer that third party applications may be to blame excluding the still unresolved issues with traversal stutter but it's the same schtick different day
Can indeed confirm with a 4090 ryzen 5950x and 64gb of ram on windows 11 it still sucks and can't hit 60fps Basically their entire explanation is off Cannot believe someone actually greenlit that response I think you are right either they are downplaying it and trying to make it seem like it's only a few people having issues or they have no real grasp as to how bad it is
I have a 4090 and a i7 I can t average more than maybe 60 90 fps right now My cpu could be better but still
Either they're downplaying the number of players affected They're just lying cunts is all This will carry on until people stop buying their shit and wait for performance reviews
They test their games on various common builds consumers have They knew They are gaslighting
I have a 4070ti with i9 13900 and using win11 1440p epic quality with rtx on and i have 70 100fps So i Guess not everyone has this problem but a lot of people
You all are convinced it s 100 because you downvote anyone who says it runs okay
It's 40 positive on Steam which means 40 at a minimum aren't having significant performance issues possibly more if people just don't like the gameplay looking at a lot of the reviews it sounds like it's just the first area with performance problems for most people
Funnily enough your statement is more of a gas lighting statement then the one you claim is gas lighting For a percentage Yes that is correct Some people are not reporting performance issues Your statement of stating it s everyone is actual gas lighting and objectively incorrect For windows 10 users Did you even read the entire statement I m assuming no because you missed the For example at the beginning of the second paragraph You literally failed reading comprehension here And I don t feel like typing your last statement because it s misconstrued and literal gas lighting High end GPU s with lower performing CPUs is so vague it can literally mean anything Your statement has definitives where EA s didn t So in your dumb rant against EA you failed reading comprehension lied misconstrued and gas lit I don t care to defend a corporation selling a game with serious issues but when you lie and make an idiot of yourself it helps no one
5950x is not high end
Technically Windows 11 is still version 10 0 so once again they are right
I have a 4080 and 12700k Win 11 RT on running a 3440x1440 monitor and it performed perfectly fine through the first chapter A rare stutter in the cutscenes but nothing in gameplay
I just played it for a this happens going into the start menu after 30 seconds it smooths back out Iv had it do this same bug out during a big fight Its using all my GPU I bet if I lower resolution ill see the GPU usage issue I just got after burner setup so i can see lows avg seemed like40 60 fps
So far with my rig 12900k 4090 64g DDR4 ram Win11 I'm getting 80 120fps At least during the intro scene Gpu is all over the place tho from 60 98 everything is on ultra rtx on native 3440x1440 I only got 45minutes to play so far will be monitoring more tomorrow So far a few stutters and an audio glitch which is bad being in the first 45 minutes lol
The game is bugged It's possible to sometimes on some systems with a 300 GPU to get 60 90fps My 6600xt can do 70fps If I screw with graphics settings too much it permanently bugs until I restart my computer Until then it starts to stutter like mad There is also a memory leak You have to restart the game every few hours or it'll just restart itself through a crash on 16gb systems
Its not everybody tho I played all day yesterday on high settings with no problems I have windows 11 2070super and a 3900x with 32g ram
The performance makes no sense to me I have a Ryzen 9 7900X 32Gbs of Ram at 6000mhtz and a 4080 The game runs at around 80 fps with everything maxed on a 1440p monitor Then without fail about 10 minutes after I start playing it totally shits the bed and goes to sub 1 fps and effectively locks up i have to restart the game if I want to play that 10 more minutes before it locks up again
I've had no problem with the game on max settings with my i913900k or 5900x and dual 4090s but as far is I know dual 4090s don't impact game performance and only rendering speed for blender
They just don't want to admit that the DRM is one of the root causes of these issues as we have seen time and time again in other games too Denuvo writes its code path on each installed version of the game and scans relentlessly from what I read in the past This could explain the extremely low GPU usage in certain areas where the DRM is actively scanning game data which makes sense resulting in low GPU CPU IO as the DRM scans contents in memory explains the high VRAM RAM usage If the DRM is cracked any time soon then we will see for sure what the difference is
There have been so many tests regarding gaming performance on windows 10 and 11 with not much of a difference between the 2 in the end I understand what they're getting at with blaming windows 10 Newer CPUs would benefit more from the cpu scheduler in windows 11 but running windows 10 on those systems shouldn't render the game unplayable either Their optimization is just shit and if this is their first PR response to the problem it's going to backfire in their faces if they can't fix
This whole thing reads like thinly veiled user People silly enough to use brand new hardware on an old obsolete OS and wonder why it's slow People stupid enough to have an overpowered GPU compared to their CPU nevermind how every other game works fine Way to apologise for performance whilst taking nearly no responsibility
The game seems to only use 4 cores so I really don't see how Windows 11's task scheduler even comes into play here Such a stupid response when all the benchmarkers are saying its CPU limited do to lack of core use
Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus
Notice they didn t put this on Reddit They learned a little
Who knew so many of our customers used Windows
In that way they're also shielding the developer against criticism to some extent which is smart The devs are already under enough pressure to deliver those patches and they'd rather leave managing the PR nightmare to the publisher
I blame the users that still refuse to upgrade to windows 11
Isn't like every game playing on windows Like if your game doesn't run on the most common OS it isn't the OS
The intent is to provide the players a sense of pride and accomplishment when they upgrade their OS and Hardware to unlock a stable 60 FPS in Star Wars Jedi Survivor
This ain't EA this is the devs
Did you try windows 11 s in case it's not obvious
All this generation can do is complain Your GPU and CPU aren t up for the task Get off your lazy ass and just develop a better one s
Buys server farm Still shit
it boogle my mind I can play rdr2 with i5 2400 1060 3gb high setting ultra texture with note modification and it look better than this shit game
just use a triple 4090 sli s
Yes Get a 7950x3D with a 4090 Actually get a 7900XTX The game is sponsored by AMD so they didn t add DLSS Don t think it would ve made a big difference anyways cause Hogwarts Legacy was a mess even with DLSS 3
just buy H100 gpus and threadripper
I agree go buy a better system And make it run win 11 4090 doesn't belong with that shitty 7800x3d 4090 belongs with a 7950x3d
Nvidia Probably INNNTRODUCING THE 4090 TI Super Supreme Pronounced tie for no reason available starting tomorrow The 4090 TI Super Supreme has 30 more power than the previous flagship for only Your first born
Me with 4090 and 7900 series cpu 64 GB of ram Guess it's my fault
It does perform
Well technically 100 is a percentage right
Dated December 2022
Sigh unzip
Indeed I'm surprised people still buy any of their trash games tbh I barely even open their now even shitter than Origin launcher except to boot up bf4 or titanfall when I'm feeling a little nostalgic
Wow such a brave and unique
That's the publisher not the developer Shouldn't the dev be blamed
i m guessing that running this on linux won t fix the games issues lol
Stop running Win10 on your PS5 you noobs
I ve been playing it on quality mode on Ps5 and it s actually really smooth I had to check if it was actually locked at 30fps it Fr felt more like 45 50 ish
It runs like Sh t on a 7800X3d with 4090
My 5800x3D is a PoS e waste wafer
It's to motivate you to have a sense of pride and achievement when you travel to the future to get a 9950X4D and a RTX 7090 Ti DLSS
lol don't bother it's still relatively shitty with those CPUs
I hate how it reads like they are surprised When they literally could have released this statement a week before and gone ahead and told everyone what issues they'd have Dear EA just fucking release it as a beta That's what it is
Your last sentence is the main problem with what is wrong with this whole generation
Sounds like the marketing department has been replaced by ChatGPT some person needs to be accountable for these statements isn't it a minimum requirement to run the game on a multi threaded chipset designed for running windows as if a single core GPU or CPU could load the game Maybe they code it to run on a Pentium
I forgot about that one also Star Wars related lol
The majority of people are stupid which means most won't learn
the list of reasons I haven't preordered a game in over 5 years when will people I was reading the same posts I am today People were complaining about idiots pre ordering games blaming pre orders for half made games wondering when people will finally learn When you last pre ordered a game people were criticising you for being part of the problem
Yeah me too i don't get the 'you have to play now because what you're not internet cool anymore i mean it's a game who care if it's now or in 12 months LOL I don't get it but hey
Preordering a game you're going to buy anyway isn't the issue If I'm going to buy the game at the same price I'd preorder it for I might as well buy it when I can afford it preorder or not
100 is a percentage
Chill they have only had 21 years to get used to the new tech
P S It's your fault anyway Get better PC and OS
I'm running with similar specs disappointing to see EA publishing a game in this state Guess it's the waiting game for a few months while the patches are rolled out
90 to 100 dollars for us Canadians
Its need so they can make 70 will give us good games first but I still refuse to pay for a standard edition game for 70
Meanwhile NVIDIA is laughing out loud spectating this AMD sponsored dumpster fire
The worst part is that you HAVE to use fsr2 even if you don't want to If you set it to disabled It sets the game's render resolution to 50 you can confirm this by checking the config file located in appdata local swgame config and looks even worse I play on 1440p and have settled with using DLDSR in Nvidia control panel to 3840x2160 4k and set that as my resolution in game with fsr on quality I'd much rather play the game on native without fsr but I guess that's too much to ask I think the first one even had a slider for render resolution scaling Fps hovers around 60 so far but definitely drops lower sometimes and all I can think is how much DLSS would be drastically improving every aspect of this
Fuck no That'll further incentivize them to push further crap
Just you wait thats gonna be the new normal Runs like shit Slap the DLSS crutches on it to get somewhere normal and call it a
Low standards are a kind of standard
This is technically accurate Intel s Thread Director does not function on W10 so E cores won t be scheduled effectively I am unaware of how Zen 4 X3D works on W10 but I wouldn t be shocked to see it performing worse The problem is it runs like shit on W11 too so they re deflecting blame
I believe 13th gen intel CPUs work better on windows 11 since it can better utilize the E and P cores But lots of reviewers were on AMD hardware and still got the same performance issues so I doubt this is why
Windows 11 was designed for modern CPUs it's been a thing for intel
'While Windows 10 considers the E cores as lower performance than P cores it doesn t know how well each core does at a given frequency with a workload whereas Windows 11 does Combine that with an instruction prioritization model and Intel states that under Windows 11 users should expect a lot better consistency in performance when it comes to hybrid CPU designs
Windows 11 has a newer CPU scheduler that supposedly works better with the E and P cores that are in the newest Intel chips I'm not saying that EAs excuse isn't BS but just letting you know that it is known that there are certainly differences in how each OS is able to work with the hardware After all that is the primary function of operating systems to manage the hardware resources and provide a way to run applications against that hardware And with a major OS increment there will be a lot of changes under the hood on how the OS functions
The E cores work more optimally on Win11 The games is fucked up in optimization and is CPU bottlenecked So EA tries to blame the users for anything that even slightly decreases CPU performance In short they blame the users with new high end CPUs that play on the most used OS so essentially as many of those users as possible Then they blame users with older CPUs too for having the gall to have a modern GPU that reveals the shitty game CPU optimization when you look at the low GPU load
Where's the sweet sweet money if they spend it on stupid QA
back in your days games were shipped and never got a patch bigger than a few megabyte after release
Their engine This game was built with UE4 not Frostbite
Under the hood Windows 11 has a very different CPU scheduler IIRC
And as long as people keep preordering these games giving them cash upfront for an unfinsihed game they will keep doing it
The Dead Space port has a lot of stuttering on PC but I agree with the rest
I mean it's technically right It's probably a bunch of little optimizations they have to do
Shows how ignorant you are if you think that statement is at all false
Not really a surprise That's what makes PC so challenging to develop for There are so many different little configurations that can be made
Of all the holes you could've tried to poke you picked the one legitimate argument
I'm on Windows 11 with a Ryzen 5700X RTX 3060 Ti and the performance still sucks
Console version have Denuvo too because it s a mess there too x200B I mean a 7800x3dwith 4090 at 1080p the GPU is at 25 30 's a LOT even at native 4K it's bottlenecked by 13900K and 7800x3d i mean come on
Denuvo does not cause anywhere close to the performance issues seen in this game Also the DRM removed from RE Village was not Denuvo it was Capcom's own DRM solution that caused performance issues
Not really
4k with FSR is basically 1080p rendering
Ok I tested it on my 7700x didn't bother to turn off SMT and 4K dldsr FSR 2 quality RT is quiet playable 60's to 80's way higher in cutscenes It has very similar stutter as the first game did and RT really isn't worth much at all probably best to leave it off but it does look better than the first game
I'm in double digit fps 99
same boat and same setup but I'm an idiot and will be playing
It s even bottlenecked on a 7800x3d Theoretically a 5900 should be plenty fast enough for the most games
Ssshh Everyone is unable to play the game UNABLE I enjoyed a good hour before bed yesterday Max settings ultra wide ray tracing Few stutters here and there Very enjoyable 5600X 3060ti 16gb ram
Why not
Windows 11's scheduler has several updates that allow it to take advantage of certain core arrangements particarly efficiency cores that were not backported into Windows 10 So for example if you run current gen Intel CPU on Win10 it will not balance the load across the cores as effectively as on Win11
Intel 12th and 13th gen don't quite work correctly on Windows 10 The OS doesn't know how to prioritize the P and E cores But at the end of the day it's not a huge performance difference
This has literally nothing to do with AMD vs Nvidia It's a mess of a release by EA They'd had a somewhat good run recently but historically they often either screw up a game entirely or just release something VERY buggy and broken Shame too because the game itself seems to be very good
Could say the same with Cyberpunk 2077 w Nvidia sponsorship how many years did it take before it finally become good Or Witcher 3 Next Gen update that still runs like shit
Do you have stutters Otherwise it's a playable framerate
Nvidia GPUs seem to have more issues in this game and the lack of VRAM on 30 series cards certainly doesn't help
Except theirs more going on I'm struggling to run this with a Ryzen 7900x CPU and a 4090 some people might have poorly balenced systems but even with bleeding edge hardware it's bad
I have an rtx 4090 with a 7800x3d and the game runs like complete ass but go on
It is low tier
It would But the PC needs to be opotimized though 12900k and 4090 here and i am having a blast Game runs amazing for me so i am lucky But menu bugs are horrible though Changes doesn't get activated properly and you need to reboot the game But once you dial it in Holy shiet Basically turn off e cores turn off Rebar in bios turn off hags Try DLDSR at 2 25x set the resolution in game needs fullscreen set Epic settings with RT and FSR2 at Quality Reboot game and enjoy FPS numbers are sub par for this kind of hardware but the smoothness is amazing for sub 100 fps This is at 5160x2160 DLDSR originally 3440x1440 Fps varies between 80 100 on Couresant Never below or never higher width 5160 format pjpg auto webp v enabled s b2caa1656a0654e08be8b9aa013e4d04893f929e
It s shit on console too
Id software say ahahahahahahah
Saw reviews of people dropping down to 1080p with fsr on and lowering detail level only to get about a stable 40fps on a 4090 with a 13700k To say the game is very badly optimized is an endorsement more like 'it runs so let's just release it'
Settings at 0 43 v m0v0u ho81c v m0v0u ho81c Effect from Raytracing is really subpar in this game compared to other games I'm leaving it off from now on and instead raising the resolution to 6880x2880 which is the highest DSR i can use With FSR Balanced the fps is between 90 100 fps at the same area Just to bad OBS can't record at 6880x2880 with AV1 Recording does take a fair bit of performance be aware
Alders lake doesn't have full scheduler support on 10 never will
So technically they re not lying
It works 60 of the time all the time
So is zero v UfJljXugLA0
Plays perfectly fine for me on a 4070ti
I'm running it fine
It's not 100
I m playing it just fine on my 2080 SUPER with epic settings and ray tracing
I got the game to go to 110 fps at medium settings with FSR performance mode Kind of looks a bit crappy though But it's only a 300 AMD RX 6600xt
AMD users are fine So more like 90
We would like to offer a micro transaction patch in order to meet our pc user s expectations
Also if you read the positive ratings on Steam a percentage of them are ironic for example praising them for the 20 fps so they can screenshot it better
Yeaaah that ll work
The problem with this is that in the future it means they stop porting games to PC not that they'll do it better
Doubtful I bet it s only a fraction of a percent that are refunding
While there have been some really horrendous ports on PC lately sadly this has been what the gaming industry has been doing for a while now Even on consoles games have been releasing broken and buggy and that's why I rarely ever buy day one anymore What's the point of being amongst the first to play a game and be a beta tester when I can wait till the game has been finished and reduced in price
This is why Diablo 4 multiple Beta tests are being welcomes seems like it'll be a great one
Yeah it's a bummer I only just got back into PC gaming in January this year after about 10 years on hiatus due to having kids etc I'm impressed in a lot of areas but also offended as a consumer in a lot of areas Hopefully people wake up and start doing jgnt heir FUCKING JOB because testing the game on releasing after paying for it isn't OUR fucking job
Well not unless you re waiting for Amnesia The Bunker beaming face with smiling eyes
I've been doing that for years It never fails and you save money
Well this way wait and six months from now they will have it 75 off probably That s how I felt about the first one I could have and should have just waited to pay way less But if one enjoys the day one releases ya only live once But they should not be broken on release
At least we got Re4 remake bless Capcom
Yeah i dont even want to play free versions of these games gonna wait 1 2 years and maybe then try to play free versions Its absolutely unforgivable how bad these games are like they didnt even test it like they are learning from dogshit microsoft practices on firing entire testing i love these kind of statements they give me clean conscience to play games for free for next 2 decades at least
Just buy them when they're on sale already At least by that time most if all the issues have been sorted hopefully
I d extend that to the last three or so years effectively since the ps5 and Xbox one zone Xbox s x current gen released pc games have been horrendously optimised or released before they were ready Cyberpunk stands out but it s definitely not the only one
and they'd rather smash and grab your wallet than waste any more profits on nonsense like testing and optimization
It's 99 going to be shit if we are starting from a console port We need more devs who build for PC first look at Atomic Heart has absolutely amazing performance from day 1
terrible year for PC gaming releases First time
A terrible year its been a terrible few years Like pre covid
So then tell them that by not buying
You joke but that actually happens a lot
They usually do DRMs are last things that are added to games usually mere days before launch
Denuvo is a problem but it isn't this problem Don't let them blame anything but themselves
lol 41 upvotes wow I always have to comment when I see somebody say some shit like this because we have literally TWO cases of denuvo improving performance after removal LOTS of other games remove denuvo after the fact and saw no performance increase I mean even games that end up being cracked are tested against retail and see no performance difference The odds of denuvo being the actual problem are minuscule
I low key hope that the patch barely helps or introduces all sorts of new issues Just because I want to laugh about how each patch requires significant testing and EA's significant testing sucking ass
How would more terrible than not running at all look like
Fallen Order was fantastic and I highly recommend playing it
And for a lot of us it broke the game Before the patch it ran like garbage but at least the textures didn't randomly turn into ps1 era mush for no apparent reason It's funny this is the only industry where you can release an unfinished product break it abandon it and completely get away with it
I would expect the massive improvements they are going to need to implement to get it to run on last gen consoles are going to make their way to pc I bet they patched all the low hanging fruit and are now doing more deep optimization I hope
I don't think they gave up Gotham Knights which had a shitshow launch had many patches on PC and its performance is much better now I am guessing Avalanche are getting their ass handed as they're gearing up for PS4 and Xbox One release lol
I think the next patch is gonna be out on May 5th when the XBONE and PS4 versions come out with hopefully alot of work the steam db database shows updates are still happening to developmental versions
It's obvious they're focusing on getting the last gen console versions out the door There'll probably be a big patch next week unless they delay
More like they ve been focusing on fixing the shit show for the last gen consoles That version is releasing soon
I think they're focusing on the PS4 and Xbox One version for now but they'll eventually go back to HL on PC 's what i think and hope
I bet they stopped caring when EMPRESS released her version
There has been a bunch of activity on the update history on steam db for their beta and development branches I bet a patch comes out next week when the older console version launches Would have been nice to get more patches up until now but I don't think they've actually given up
They already cashed out
That game actually ran quite well even for lower and mid end systems as long as raytracing was disabled With raytracing enabled CPU demand goes through the roof RT on that game is kinda crappy tho so it's not a big deal to disable it
They already got your money no need to fix it now grinning face with smiling eyes
Hogwarts ran just fine for me on my rig from day 1 this was before my upgrade to the 13900k and ddr5 7200 Survivor is also running pretty good on my
Nah they are definitely working on a big patch that is much needed Not everything can be fixed in a week or two Look at Gotham Knights took like 3 months but eventually they shipped out a giant patch that got the game into a polished state
Really What's wrong with it
I mean if those are the cases that have the problems though beefy GPU with lower end CPU and Windows 11 optimized chip on Windows 10 it sounds like largely system configuration issues they're going to go back and optimize for anyways
But then they say using lower performing CPUs with high end GPUs is also a problem Then the solution is clearly an older CPU and a low end GPU It s so simple and EA is even saving us money
nevermind that the e cores on 12th gen are more powerful than normal cores on 6th gen lol
Using any of the current gen hw on win 10 causes major problems
Is that true I mean there are sufficient people under Windows 11 to know if there was no problems there right I have Windows 11 but I don't have the game yet so can't test my CPU is the 3000 series so not sure if that's recent enough for their cases
So you're saying my I7 9700K has a chance lol
gif giphy iXTrbbYMQBCMM
It's not their fault Microsoft didn't advertise that they fixed the scheduler of Windows 10 in the 22H2 version so now the 12th and 13th gen Intel CPUs work the same as they do on Windows 11
They can always claim in our labs these are the results we get Meanwhile their labs are optimized to run their games the way they want to get those results GM can release a car saying that it can 2000 miles on a full tank footnote in our labs testing Which means that they will always test the most perfect conditions possible And then blame the end user for doing it wrong I hate EA for pulling this garbage
Our game isn't the issue You created the issue yourself by checks notes using the most popular OS not using an ancient GPU that will hide our crappy CPU optimization
Windows is a shitty operating system though for gaming it s good enough currently better than all others but if EA think so they should consider releasing on a better OS
The fact that Dead Space ran its opening scene at 40fps on a 2070 super and 5600x was fucking hilarious And people tried to tell me it was a good port
Your fault for not having a 6950x3D to be honest Also you should be happy with 30fps Humans can't see more than that anyway S Yeah I'm mucking around in case haha In all seriousness though we've known the console PC hardware equivalent for a while so I don't understand why things are getting absolutely stupid We've had a R5 3600 and 5700xt since mid 2019 and then late 2020 that's about what the consoles were doing 1440p60 medium measuring by 1 lows should be the standard for that and medium should at least look as good as last gen high ultra NVME requirements are fine and I think that rig can use Direct Storage still 1080p30 or 900p low with FSR and again locked 1 lows with a 3600 and RX570 GTX1060 as the minimum for series S Surely that will provide enough headroom for some impressive visuals like we saw with Cyberpunk Horizon Spiderman which run well on modest hardware but scale really well and perform decently I thought this was actually going to be the gen where they put a decent CPU in and things weren't going to run like garbage for a change
Mate get off your nan's rig and get a real pc EA customer support
I have pretty much the same configuration 32GB for me and I wont touch this game now until we are 2 or 3 patches in
Im on a 5900x 4090 32gb of ram on W10 I hit 100 fps in menus bb I must be winning Serioisly tho average fps is in the 50s for me w o rt Brutal
Maybe it's Ryzen CPUs that are being affected here primarily
About the RTX on thing it is kind of funny in this game Try turning it off and on again Now It will be actually applied
AMD cpu here I just played it for a this happens going into the start menu after 30 seconds it smooths back out Iv had it do this same bug out during a big fight Its using all my GPU I bet if I lower resolution ill see the GPU usage issue I just got after burner setup so i can see lows avg seemed like40 60 fps
This is not the way There are a ton of users dozens I've seen on this sub from this morning alone that flat out state I'm getting 30 40fps on my 3080TI so it's okay on my end It's literally just a case of people just accepting poor performance or not being bothered by it
You need to look up what gas lighting actually means if you're claiming that this post is gas lighting If a minority of users aren't having performance issues that means that this post is at worst inaccurate not gas lighting 100 is a percentage 99 is a percentage Their post can technically be interpreted as any amount of users and still technically be correct The point is that they're presenting is as some users when it's clear that this is the vast majority They're doing this purposefully to downplay the extent of these issues That's the point here Claiming that their post is vague and therefore can't be wrong when it's clearly presented in a way to shift the blame just shows you can't read between the lines It's hilarious how you claim a reading comprehension fail on the Windows 10 part when you're having an entire point comprehension fail on that exact same part The operating system is entirely irrelevant to the performance issues being reported for this game Players with on Windows 11 with CPUs on multithreaded chipsets are still experiencing those issues low CPU usage small amount of cores used It has nothing to do with high end CPUs on old operating systems and EA is presenting it that way to shift the blame on the consumer like they have done frequently And if you're literally going to sit there and state EA's statement is too vague to be called wrong then you're not even worth engaging It's a moronic argument Stop the bootlicking It's revolting
face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy
I have a 4090 and 7950x3d and windows 11 and it played perfectly through the first area and same a rare stutter happened in cutscenes but nothing in gameplay
if this is their first PR response to the problem it's going to backfire in their faces if they can't fix Looks at Anthem and EA Starwars Battlefront comment st j9y0flrh sh 787f8b98 st j9y0flrh sh 787f8b98 This issue is a blip for the company execs
The most ridiculous part about it is that Windows 10 is installed on well over 3 times the number of systems Windows 11 is Also Windows 10 will still be supported for another 2 and a half years which is well beyond the time frame they'll be updating the game for There really is no good reason for them not to have tested the game on modern high end hardware while running the most popular OS
Also isn t it their job to test their game on different rigs Like windows 10 is still being used by a lot of people
I am in windows 11 and it is the worst port I have ever played
Windows will never be the bottleneck Bad developers are always the bottleneck
meh i have a 12900k on windows 10 everything runs fine it s just not peak performance just excuses
I understand what they're getting at with blaming windows 10 I don't Is there quite literally any advantage to running the game on 11 over 10 right now sure maybe in like idk 2 years when hardware is made directly for windows 11 but right now i doubt theres any comparable difference between the 2 OS' that changes how well you can run the game
These are the official system requirements from their website Let me highlight the OS they recommend in both levels OS Windows 10 64 bit
I actually do blame the people that use top end hardware on an old obsolete os People should let old obsolete os's die and upgrade to the currently supported os's That's their own fault for doing that
The most stupid PR statement in
We recommend installing it on OneDrive for best performance
Windows 11 Windows 98 is way more upto date
just pick yourself up from your cable management straps
uLtRa SeTtInGs ArE fOr FuTuRe HaRdWaRe dIaL tHeM dOwN
Only 64 Get with it and join the 128 club my man
Yes we are the idiots for thinking the game would run well on something way above the listed requirements
It's about 20 slower than the equivalent intel it shouldn't be that significant
Go play Minecraft I am tired of people with 4090s expecting to play at 60 fps
Yes it is bc you run that low performing cpu
I saw the reccommended spec for an upcoming MMO Perfect New World being anything better than a 10700k and a 3080 As someone with a 4070ti and a 10700k I choked on my water reading those specs As for bad console ports Wild Hearts takes the cake for me I have a system that in theory can run it at 144hz 1440p but the game only runs under
This has to be cap Right
Sigh zips back up
Dead Space remake is an instant classic
Lots of great games I don't see the problem This game seems to be pretty good
They re just a publisher They publish both great games and garbage games
EA has got lots of cool games the Star Wars games in particular are quite good IMO I don t really care about micro transactions so that s a factor I ve heard this game in particular is pretty good outside of performance issues
Yo EA is the publisher and personally I like Respawn as a studio and I don t want them to close So yeah blame me all you want but EA is the bad guy here so I ll continue to support Respawn even tho my money is going to EA A tough price to pay I m aware but I m personally convinced that Respawn are not the ones to blame for the poor state of the game
because the series is good and so is jedi survivor barring performance issues a fantastic game bogged down by a shit port
Even though BF 2042 is okay as of right when it first came out and i saw how broken it was That day i am like NO MORE EA I mean i hated EA before but 2042 was kinda the last straw And with this Star Wars game well doesn't shock me anymore
The games aren't all trash though EA's adherence to weird timelines and not properly optimizing games before release is an issue Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor are great games being dragged through the mud cause they didn't want to take an extra few months to optimize better
i dont open that crummy launcher because it never remembers my fuckin credentials
Not entirely I assume EA would be pressuring devs to ship an incomplete unoptimized game
The publisher is usually the one who forces the relesase date before the product is ready especially when they are owned by EA like Respawn is
Remember if the game ships without issues good job devs if the game ships with issues blame the publisher
Lol who hired who and who works for who Pretty simple
Oh boy someone please tell him
In this case even without all of the details at hand the truth will come out eventually as it always does we can assume that the game wasn't ready to ship but EA forced the developer's hand Not a single soul at Respawn wanted to see the game ship in this poor state
Would be funny if it did tho
Yeah the quality mode 30fps is ok the performance mode is borked with inconsistant frametime and stuttering
I've been playing it on PS5 and quality feels choppy You can easily tell it's 30 Imagine my surprise when I switch to performance and it's getting 50 at
7800x3d is bottlenecking my 3080 at 1440p ultrawide with fsr in some areas
W or even test this kind of thing
funny enough when was fallen order something around that time and it had the same issues on launch despite looking worse and having less gameplay mechanics and less content
60 80 fps with dips below 60 fps for top tier hardware seems fine to you Don't give these clowns a pass
Thats why I just paid the 20 on EA Play instead just gonna finish it within this next week and uninstall the game
I don't think this is right This is the first comment I've seen stating this it isn't anywhere else Reading a line in a config file is not verification that is running at 50 res Subjectively disabling FSR looks 100x better when running the game at 4k on my 4090 Going to need a source from some pixel counters before I subscribe to this random comment
The game is CPU bottlenecked DLSS wouldn't do a damn thing aside from maybe give you better AA till that is fixed just like FSR isn't doing a damn thing now Frame Generation but that's not what they said
Depends on the X3D part you get A 7800X3D should have no problem on Windows 10 because it's one chiplet and all cores have access to the V Cache so it's effectively your standard CPU with no high priority cores in the eyes of the OS Only when you're talking about the higher core count X3D chips where only some of the cores have access to the V Cache does the Windows 11 scheduler improvements become more necessary
but even for Intel how much real world final framerate difference would that make for the average game like are we talking 3 10 25
Yeah sure but if you're running a top of the line 13th gen intel CPU on Windows 10 it really shouldn't be a problem at all just the E cores are affected The issue here is that even AM4 AMD CPUs are suffering from low utilization That's not a windows problem is a game problem
Thread director does work on W10 it's just optimized for W11 whatever that means In practice there's not much of a difference
Afaik there has been problems with the 7000 series ryzen on win11
But lots of reviewers were on AMD hardware and still got the same performance issues so I doubt this is why Lots of reviewers were playing the game before the day 1 patch was available so what they were seeing and telling people about is not the reality as of today
Look at me you're the QA now
There are quite a few examples of games with glaring technical issues never getting fixed by all these patches though Jedi Fallen Order the prequel to this game is one of them
It does but the game reportedly suffers even on CPUs that don't have 3D cache or E P cores that the newer schedule handles better Plus Windows 10 has over 70 market share while Windows 11 is at 19 Granted office computers and laptops make up a good share of that but it'd still be idiotic for EA to put little effort toward evaluating windows 10 performance under these circumstances
Oh really Man that sucks It runs fine on my setup so I just assumed it must be a good port I don't tend to ever be one of the lucky ones who avoid problems when it comes to bad ports
EA You shouldn't have used comparable and balanced components Totally your fault
Doubt its denovu on console Probably respawn rushed the project because of EA and now working overtime to fix all platform
Are these results actually on W10 though More interested in knowing how accurate their statements are and how the performance will differ on W11
It was actually that village had TWO drms
lol once again people get mad that denuvo actually works at stopping day 1 piracy so they invent fake news to get people mad at it
You're actually wrong Just Google it Denuvo was removed from RE Villiage and the game got better for it
Fsr 2 performance is closer to 1080p rendering a lot of overhead Fsr 2 quality is 1440p internal rendering with a lot of overhead He s getting numbers similar to Forspoken and the Callisto Protocol at similar settings max settings rt on 4K fsr quality Very heavy but not broken
I d say for all the games This is bad DLSS3 should help it a LOT but there is no DLSS at all only FSR2
It's probably not AMD but it's funny the last couple of AMD sponsored games had these awful releases
That s a shit frame rate for the hardware and resolution though
No stutter so it is payable but just badly optimised
Yeah and the rest of your setup Your overclock ram powersupppy maybe your card variant or maybe the fact that you went with amd is the issue All I m saying is Not everyone is having a shitty experience And this is why I never go amd Ever I never said the game is perfect But to say the game is shit because YOUR experience is bad Well go play a different game then Sorry the parts you picked can t play it
Corpos are always very careful to hedge what they
That's the smell of desire my lady
I mean they're using their standards so it might as well be 1
Shhh You re not allowed to break the narrative If you see a few Reddit posts about it it means approximately 100 of people are having issues
Meanwhile my 2080ti is under 60fps on medium It's playable but the experience is marred T T Just checked epic settings with RT on solid 35fps Playable Yes God awful Also yes
Some people have encountered a bug where they turned off RayTracing in settings menu after trying it on but the setting still activates even after game restart And vice versa turning it on from an off setting might not actually activate any RT at all even after game restart The fix was 'turning it off and on again' The game is buggy atm So you might need to check if RT is actually on in your game
And the shareholders Mainly the shareholders
I could finally get a new sense of pride and accomplishment
Def feel what you're saying but there's still value to be had Hogwarts Legacy had a fair share of problems but my wife 100 it and my daughter completed it within a week Both loved it and when I started to explain some of the issues they just didn't care I'm going back at some point but must admit I also enjoyed my time with it even if I spent a good amount of time fiddling with settings ha Same goes for Cyberpunk which ran fine for me and wasn't an issue tho even there I'm waiting for the newest patch and DLC to drop to actually beat the game
XD Imagine still trusting Blizzard after all this time Warzone 2 launch Diablo 3 launch Terrible performance of D4 beta Warcraft 3 Reforged crashes during official tournament Wow BFA and Shadowlands My god some people just love being fucked without asking their names BFA and Shadowlands also had betas A lot of reports have been ignored Buut sure D4 will be great
Don't kid yourself Diablo 4 will still be a buggy mess when it's officially released Word has it that Blizzard is facing a mass exodus once pandemic restrictions were lifted never mind the fact they're probably still reeling from their harassment scandal They would be better off having an open beta until week before their official release rather than having a single short lived beta session
Exactly After the last open beta I did pre order D4 For the earlier access and to reward them for having open betas at all I haven't done a pre order in years but was legitimately impressed with the game during the beta Hopefully that wasn't a mistake
I'm on the same boat as you thats funny Except I got back in early last year Its so mind blowing how someone can put out products like this I know if I did something like that in my 't have one
It shouldn t even be that way anymore because Xbox IS as stripped down windows 10 machine running on a Radeon The whole point of the Xbox architecture from the git go was to make ports very easy and the last couple of generations have literally been PCs
Sure it does
Honestly would be pretty meta release a game not optimized include denuvo so everyone blames it vs them releasing an unfinished product Later on release a patch that fixes it also remove denuvo so everyone thinks it was just denuvo rather then their own shit
Denuvo being there is their fault though
new Denuvo uses 12gb of vram
Idk if it helps remove Denuvo from the ecosystem I see it as a big win
Don't let them blame anything but themselves They would totally be the ones to blame for a botched DRM implementation too
Game quality been tanking for a decade now We hit a new low
They completely broke RT with that patch too Reflections display the wrong textures or no textures at all allowing you to see through walls shadows below ultra act like there is no wall in half of the castle letting light stream in and AO is apparently a bit fucked up too Shit is ridiculous
That's crazy the empress pirated version ran like a dream I was shocked I didn't encounter any of the bugs people who bought it encountered It was on a 1080ti so perhaps old school without ray tracing eliminated some bugs Its not the first time its happened to me RDR2 constantly crashed on me yet the pirated version didn't I can't complain i got this free I'll give it a go
That's because you don't have enough VRAM for the texture quality you use Try turning it down a setting or 2 if possible
Before the patch it ran like garbage but at least the textures didn't randomly turn into ps1 era mush for no apparent reason This was an intentional fix for low VRAM players
I just fixed that texture problem like 2 days ago scoured google for days before i found a way to fix it
I am pretty sure they have completely given up to make texture load properly and keep FPS reasonable with 8GB VRAM GPU at this point someone from dev team probably just say ''Eh fps look good my job is done good bye '' If they actually act honest and tell 8GB VRAM GPU owner to lower their texture to low medium fair play but now it just feel a little bit dishonest even though my personal experience with the game is quite good due to having 12GB VRAM
Patches don't make money devs cost money More money execs gets their bonus
Both are symptoms of insufficient VRAM Instead of the jarring stutters now you just get mushy textures which while terrible is still better than how it was
Hogwarts legacy runs fine if you have a proper pc
Because people will just keep throwing money at them with pre orders They have no reason to give a shit Why would they It's worked this long why change anything now
I guess what do we have as consumers to allow them to not get away with it I want the product I just wish they would finish it before
Isn't that PS1 mushy textures mostly a VRAM limitation That was their pathetic fix just to force the game to unload textures from memory seemingly at random to prevent the stuttering from a lack of VRAM How much VRAM does your gpu have I am not defending the game or the developer for such a shitty port
Plus with Denuvo attached to the game you are forced to install a broken update because the game requires Internet connection
How sad that the bootleg version is more stable still
Imagine going to the Cinemas and seeing a bunch of wires and people in green suits flying around onscreen lol
Here I thought I was going crazy The patch before last was absolutely solid for me Any way to revert
I usually wait about 3 5 years before I buy a game By then the price is usually down to 20 30 or if you're lucky can maybe catch it on sale for a great steal of a price Also all the patches and DLC is already released and you can often get a package deal that just includes everything I just got Pillars of Eternity 2 for 15 with every DLC on GoG com
People keep buying and it'll keep happening At some point you gotta realise that if you're preordering the game and it turns out to be shit you've contributed to the problem Once you fork out 60 bucks for a AAA single player title there's nothing more a dev needs from you So it's very possible to just abandon the game and don't waste any money if people keep buying Obviously a gross oversimplifaction but a valid point nonetheless
People keep buying day one without waiting for a decent amount of 's free money for companies
ERP software qa tech any production machine that is quite
That s what I m hoping for as well an update alongside last gen release
When you say its much better have you tested the patches and confirm if performance improved for example by how much
Even Forspoken runs better actually can reach 70 90 FPS with 3080 At lauch cant get 60 FPS running at 4k with DLSS and 5600x
But it's not they're just trying to save face Rtx 4090's with amd 7800x3d the fastest gpu and cpu in the market for games struggle running the game It's just a dogshit port
But I have a high end of both lol Still can't get a solid 60
I mean I'm on a i9 9900k with a 1080 Ti game is running pretty good for me so far
I was re reading the system requirements on seam and there is no mentions of any testing environment or testing conditions like you see of car manufacturers' websites They may be safe under us consumer's law but i wonder whether in the EU they and others who pull this bullshit may be liable to lawsuits
Hey guys this is our first game It's not much but it's ours Please be nice
I'm mad at myself for rewarding it but dead space is one of my all time favorites and the remake was so good I was willing to overlook it Jedi survivor is just too rough for that It runs so bad I can't even push through I got dips into the 20s even A 3080ti and an 11700k is not ancient tech It was high end just a couple years ago
Dead Space original not sure if it still applies to the remake on PC has never run well for a vast number of people I still haven't been able to play it Either you get 30 FPS and slow mouse movement or you get 60 FPS and Invisible walls
If it was 4k ultra with RT 2070 super doing 40fps is pretty damn good
I'm not
AMD cpu here too played for about 15 hours so far and 7800X3D and 4090 and i m playing at 4K RT Epic averaging about 75 80 fps
And there are a ton of user reviews on steam claiming they get a solid 60 frames or performance is fine or that they aren't seeing the issues everyone else is or just for the first area So I don't think there's anything wrong with my statement It's not everyone that's an outright lie
The 667 THOUSAND downvotes is so beautiful
Well on alder lake and Ryzen 5000 you will see better performance on windows 11 because of the better CPU scheduler That has been tested and confirmed to be true But bad developers can be a bottleneck too
There's many videos online from reputable hardware reviewers that have indeed shown a difference in their tests but when it comes down to gaming there really isn't that great of a difference between windows 10 or 11 Windows 11 is strongly encouraged for newer hardware because the CPU schedule is better at delegating tasks to threads somewhat better than windows 10 but even that is not something that would cripple your performance overall It can for some things however I was making the assumption above that they're seeing a lot of reports from people who just so happen to be using the latest hardware using windows 10 and not windows 11 That's how I read part of their excuse
Right but you missed my point Reading between the lines they're saying that people with newer hardware should be using windows 11 instead of windows 10 I assume they're hinting that the scheduler in windows 10 may be causing issues with newer hardware and their game Windows 10 should be fine with Intel gen 11 and below and Ryzen 3000 and below The windows 11 scheduler plays better with the newer CPUs that have big and little cores
Come back to me when windows 11 isnt a buggy pos and when there is any remote evidence that it improves gaming performance
Since forever ago the best bet has been to skip Windows releases Get 98 skip ME get XP skip Vista get 7 skip 8 get 10 skip 11 Microsoft is notorious for releasing garbage versions of Windows half the time and I consider 11 to be in that list
Respawn made it not EA
Recommended Enterprise Microsoft Azure Cloud Server plan
Got me there 98 11 However Might I suggest windows 2000 instead
Plus Win98 is like 120MB for the installation Super thin on resources Bet ya it wouldn't take more than a single thread on your CPU at any given time
Just got a Crysis flashback
I know you re being sarcastic but that was legit true and fine a while back when the ultra settings actually looked far ahead of their time Ultra now looks as one expects
I wouldn't even mind turning down some stuff if it makes it better but bizarrely for this game you can set everything to 720p minimum settings and it'll still cap out at like 60ish FPS on a 4090 and a 13900k
it runs at the exact same FPS on all low lol
They don't sell higher end cpus
It still was pretty bad on release for pc
Even the villains get a good one here and there
I'm sorry can you name a single good star wars game from EA I can't find one after Jedi Academy in
Respawn is fine they have Apex Right now they are the darling studio for EA and not Bioware or DICE
It s not a shit port when the console version runs ass it s a faulty program in the core itself
are they great games or mud dragged games I'm confused
No Respawn is relatively autonomous and have said as such Yes they are owned by EA who publishes the game even though that role is diminishing in recent years but nearly all their decisions are their own
Ikr people here will do anything but look at the actual studios which are relatively autonomous nowadays
You are delusional if you dont think this is nearly all Respawns fault They are pretty much autonomous and have said that themselves
They were working on improving it Here
That sucks man
After playing further I d have to suggest making sure your ps5 is okay or cleaned out I know it s only 30 fps but I ve experienced zero stutters or choppiness if you were referring to the 30 fps in it self as choppy then okay I gotcha but if not maybe make sure your console is clean and has decent airflow access Quality mode is as smooth as butter for me I know I m sounding like an absolute shill but I barely even pay attention to the franchise tbh so take that as you will
Fallen Order was at the end of 2019 Same deal Pushed out early technical difficulties and then fixed after the fact I only played it after the fix and found it a reasonably good experience The only thing more predictable than a prematurely released Star Wars game from EA are the responses to a prematurely released Star Wars game from EA
Can confirm looks 100x better for me too when disabling FSR
I'm on 1440p and with fsr enabled Cal and BD are definitely sharper than with it disabled at least when being static And the blurriness that's present with fsr disabled is not supposed to be there as I know what 1440p native should look like
To be clear I'm not in favor of anything that preceeds fixing this poorly developed game I don't care if it takes a couple hours to get DLSS working by their shitty standards whatever that means they need to fix this game first
this is good to know thanks
The problem is it could end up using E cores instead of your high performance cores
Lol it actually worked ok for me as I didn't download it until last night and tried it with 4090 7950x Sure it stuttered and took a long time to optimize shaders before it even loaded the main game screen but after that it was just a little stuttering and then I got stuck in a spot I can't seem to find a way out
Typical EA unless its the sims they don't care
That game was unplayable for me the micro stutters made it nearly impossible to time the lightsaber swings and blocks
If you've got a very fast CPU it's much less noticeable which is probably why you didn't notice it My 3900X is showing its age
Well I have Windows 11 and while it ran mostly about 60fps on my 4K display I did see times when it dropped to 30 40 fps but then in some rare occation 100fps so it was all over the place CPU 5800X3D
Thanks for the clarification I don't have FSR so I wasn't sure it was higher upscaling than I thought
Yes a lot of titles implement Fsr over dlss for some reason
You act like this is an isolated experience to just a select few people Pretty much every reviewer must be lying then I must be lying Everybody on this sub making the same complaints must be lying especially the ones saying they are having issues with i913900 because it might just be AMD Lmao you are ridiculous
You re the sexiest bot I ve ever read
but thats just how it is i spend hours in streams an all platforms yesterday how can someone with a 15k pc EVEN HAVE ANY ISSUES HOW
I m getting near 60 last night pcs are finicky especially depending on cpu Lol I like how I get downvoted in my other comment because I m not part of the 100 of pcs not working well Poor babies think Reddit is the center of the world
Update to 4k 144hz monitor RT on x200B Already finished the game on my 2080ti so I can wait until they fix this so i can NG but ffs
Hey little Suzie It looks like daddy's not going to be able to afford that new pony for your bday after
Yeah I definitely understand why some people still buy games day one especially considering that most don't care and just want to have fun but I've been saving so much money and getting the best experience simply by waiting I'm like 1 2 years behind on current games and it's been a joy playing through everything with no issues
Hopefully that wasn't a mistake Well given the availability of refunds these days a big risk in pre ordering has been removed If reviews lambast D4 before release or it's otherwise broken on release like suddenly being bug ridden unable to run properly etc Then you have within 14 days of release purchase and or 2 hours of playtime in which to get a refund Battlenet's policy seems to be the same as steams
true yet the devs still keep fucking the ports up lol
It does it often happens that the builds QA tests internally don't have denuvo on them and are pushed directly from the devs Final builds are usually flying in fast so there often isn't time to add it I am not saying it's always the case but it has happened at the studios I've worked with and same for a couple of friends at major studios
I wonder if they would hire people on Reddit to shill for them too Of course that would fall apart as soon as someone calls them out for their blatant bullshit like their claims that Denuvo uses VRAM and causes low CPU utilization Lol
Cool That's not the point of this post
No it doesn't
A DRM implementation that has nothing to do with the performance problems we've seen on this game so far
AAA studio gaming
Only for AAA corporately produced games meant to squeeze every dollar they can from users Tons of independent and smaller studios are making some incredible games they just don't have the brand recognition of an IP like starwars or millions of dollars in marketing pushing their game in your face every 30 seconds
Not really we are never hitting Atari level again
Yeah and since the refunds are a thing publishers just put out something like this to stop people from refunding and miss the time window
This is by far one of the worst takes Redditors have
Yeah I completely gave up on the game until they fix it I didn t buy a high end video card to look at some half baked broken raytracing implementation
1080ti has 11gb of VRAM You were also probably playing at 1080p or 1440p on that card A lot of the people were using 8gb GPUs or lower which even at 1080p could run out of VRAM Causing a stuttery mess and now texture pop in etc
As much as your getting downvoted it looks like your right Hardware unboxed did a video showing this
8gb shouldnt be considered low vram at least MID
No they're symptoms of insufficient optimization
Hardware unboxed did a video exposing this very issue Textures popping in and out was shown on 8gb cards Even at low resolutions
Hmm is that on Windows 11 too
What res and settings Just curious as someone who will be picking it up eventually
The only reason I didn't refund Jedi Survivor is because I'm playing with a controller and can deal with the shite frames That and I was looking forward to a fresh narrative experience and fuck if I was gonna watch a cutscene compilation for this
XD I'm cracking up reading this on my 3rd gen i5 with a 1070 Safe to say I won't be playing any game released after 2015 even if I wanted to
Nope 1080p
Either way I'm really happy you get to play with good performance this weekend I wish I
If i turn off ray tracing i get like 70 to low 80 gpu use and getting high 40 to 60ish It seems to really like higher frequency cpus as its not using multi cores correctly It feels like my Vcach isnt being used at all
Its mostly playable for me 3080 58003XD 4k on default settings mostly ultra some on high it has bug where it stutters if u open the start menu for 30 secs to a min Im sure if i lower res ill see my GPU will be bottlenecked by how poorly its handling cpu use for some of us
I've yet to see any video let alone tons of them showing consistent performance above 60fps There are thousands of videos on YouTube Look at them Colossal majority cannot even come near a consistent 60fps All evidence points to this being the COLOSAAL MAJORITY of PC players at minimum And besides there's a ton wrong with your statement Your assumption that every single positive review is from someone who is experiencing good performance is false as there are tons of people here and elsewhere who have flat our stated sub 60fps on their PC is acceptable
Most downvoted comment in reddit's history
How can that account have 31k karma with a 667k post Don't those downvotes lower karma Just the sheer volume of downvotes is quite amazing
CPU scheduler What percentile of difference Because running a program with complexities of O n log n is still going to be awfully more complex than any program well designed with sane complexity timing
fair enough id just imagine hardware that upgraded from win10 to 11 wouldn't really be effected at all idk
Have you actually tried windows 11 I purely run it And besides after the next public build windows 10 will no longer be supported by Microsoft So no more ways to prevent viruses and malware from entering windows 10 without actually purchasing software to do that Microsoft will no longer release any updates to windows 10 So basically Microsoft is forcing windows 10 users to upgrade to windows 11 after the next windows 10 public build
Same difference
There's a windows 2000 Guess my system doesn't meet the requirements to install it
It'll only use 1GB of RAM too so light
That s what I m being told when I bitch about bad coding and low performance lmao In our case future hardware and lazy devs are gonna rely on FG and other AI stuff
At least Crysis genuinely was a graphics leading game
I liked Battlefront 1 and 2 along with Jedi Fallen Order I m not familiar with the others after Jedi Academy either but these were quite good Didn t play Battlefront 2 on launch so missed the mess that happened there but by the time I picked it up it was excellent Still can find matches regularly now
Jedi Fallen Order was excellent
that's fair i suppose calling it a shit port in that case is inaccurate it needs work
Both
Got to love how Valve has to fix every fucking developer's problems for them I just wish the fixes also worked on Windows but hey at least dualbooting works well
I know you're only trying to help but the game is absolutely unoptimized Outside I'm getting sub 45 frames and hella screen tearing Settings are performance with no chroma no film grain no motion blur Quality mode makes it feel like there's input lag Playing on a C2 so no issues with the TV I clean out my console at the same time I clean out my PC once every 3 months and I did so a little over a month ago when the warm weather showed up This game clearly needed more time for optimization Feel free to look at other threads in different subs and see that this is an everyone issue
god damn its only 4 years barely and they didnt learn a single thing haha
After another day's worth of stories about this game it is clear there is a bug likely yourself and u rustinr are affected by You can fix the bug by toggling the overall graphics preset down to low applying then back up to epic applying then individually setting the settings how you want not using the overall preset and applying The game will render at 100 res and look vastly better than with FSR Just another shitty bug to add to the list
This game is sponsored by AMD though so it is extremely unlikely DLSS being add in and since denuvo was used it will be unlikely DLSS gets mod in
Ah I assumed you were coming at it from the angle of 'DLSS masked bad optimization' that so many do when it wouldn't even help this games particular blend of poor CPU optimization My bad Alas we should be able to get both optimization and DLSS though that AMD sponsorship is probably going to kill the chance of the latter
The majority of the games target audience consoles can't use DLSS so until NVIDIA makes it open source like they did with G Syinc support for new games may be patchy
It s actually the opposite P cores are prioritized so you lose efficiency gains from using E cores instead plus background tasks will go to P cores instead of E cores potentially influencing app performance
Ugh Sorry to hear And they dare charge so much for games now Used to be what 49 99 This one is 69 99
It can't be that seeing as I have a worse CPU than you do 3600 haha I did limit the FPS to 60 and I did turn on AMD Fidelity FX2
Most if not all modern games I play have DLSS This should be totally agnostic FSR DLSS and XeSS should all be available
Lmfao YOURE ridiculous if you think that reviewers don t want to make the most click bait content they can find I never said the game was perfect But most of these reviewers are playing on windows 10 with amd cpus lol Like cope some more I m telling you that with my 4080 and 13900k I don t have issues I m not seeing review upon review of people with intel cpus that are actually running windows 11 that are playing this game And a lot of them reviewed the copy that did not have day one patch Sorry your system can t run it and you can t play the game That honestly sucks But crying about it won t do shit Amd is butt Always has been Always will be There statistics are inflated and in most actual game tests other than like cod intel beats them out Also most people don t seem to realize that they need to restart the game after changing settings either Is that a bug Sure Is it easy to get around Yes
how can someone with a 15k pc EVEN HAVE ANY ISSUES HOW How can someone with a 400 000 Ferrari even have any issues S
That's because you are either full of shit or are blind Plenty of videos out there showing the issues search query jedi survivor pc performance search query jedi survivor pc performance
And TBH it's not like Diablo 4 is re inventing the wheel I played the beta and it felt very much like Diablo 3 5 they didn't stray too far from the proven formula Game ran smooth and looked good on the new engine
I know it s baffling
I mean that does happen But I thought you meant that denuvo constantly caused performance issues
It's adorable that in 2023 people would still believe that they don't have social media analysts or managers that are effectively paid to shill paid to control a narrative
Point of the post is that EA is blaming users for poor performance when really it s their fault for putting denuvo on the game
you don't get jokes don't
But even with such promise there's zero reason for people not to refund Get money back now and if they actually follow through with the promise and the game ever gets better people can just buy it again then There's even a chance it will be cheaper by then too
Same I haven't launched it once since finding the shit broken I reported it on their issue tracker and it was marked as investigating fairly quickly which gave me some 's been radio silence for almost two months I had played 50h of the game up till that point including 8 playing in the ini tweaking variables to get it just right many of them to improve RT quality Had it looking quite nice If they continue to drag their feet I'll be grabbing an older build from alternative sources to finish the game
I played at 1440p on a 3070 it ran fine
Dude like seriously 1070 was 8gb in 2016 for 379 That was mid range at that time Just how long will ppl try to delude themselves that 8gb is mid in 2023 when consoles have 16gb 12 13gb vram Time goes on shifts happen Happened many times before my first graphics card had 16mb vram And it will happen in the future as well
Not saying the optimization is great but the problems that plague Hogwarts Legacy doesn't happen with cards that have sufficient VRAM People have been warning about this exact problem since the 30 series was leaked and it's playing out exactly how we expected it to You can blame the devs but ultimately they don't give a fuck and you're stuck with a card that struggles with modern games Downvoting people who brings this up is not gonna fix your issues
Nobody wants to hear it though Unfortunate but people are invested in their purchases and will defend them to the end Especially the poor folks who bought in during the mining craze
Presumably The 7800x3d is a new chip for a new platform AM5 so anybody using it would more than likely doing a new build since it also requires DDR5 memory meaning they'd download the latest operating system when installing a new drive
Check ordinarygamer's twitter On system with 5950x 4090 at 720p with FSR ultra performance mode he was getting 40 50 FPS
All them
I wish I had your fortitude It's just a little too much I'll give it a week and refund if they don't fix it by then
Settings Ray Tracing
You sure bout that
Reddit's algorithm doesn't subtract negative karma from past karma earned I have tested this The algorithm also places emphasis on karma for the 1st hour
100 is the lowest you can go assuming you ever hit it In addition to the other algorithm mentioned
Here's a good review
Full path tracing is for future hardware I don't mind them saying that much Pretending that some rando UE4 title that barely even looks different than the first version from years ago is some insulting we believe you're this fucking stupid bullshit
god damn its only 4 years barely and they didnt learn a single thing haha Sure they did From Wikipedia The PlayStation 4 version of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order sold 26 761 copies within its first week on sale in Japan which made it the fifth bestselling retail game of the week 75 In the UK it was the second bestselling retail game during its first week on sale behind Pok mon Sword and Shield with 66 of sales being for the PlayStation 4 version and the remaining 34 for the Xbox One version 76 It had the fourth most successful launch for a video game physical release in 2019 77 In the US it was the second best selling game in November and December 2019 only behind the Call of Duty Modern Warfare reboot With only two months of sales it was still the sixth best selling game of the year in the US and Respawn's most profitable premium title of all time 78 Electronic Arts confirmed that Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order had the fastest selling digital launch for any Star Wars game within its first two weeks on sale 79 The game sold more than 8 million copies by the end of January 2020 exceeding EA's expectations 80 More than 10 million units were sold by March 31 2020 81 By June 2021 the game had attracted more than 20 million players 82 They learned that the teething problems were dwarfed by the absolute shitload of money that Fallen Order made Honestly the problem with companies like EA is that they don't just release games in isolation There's all the associated shit that goes with it Advertising buys media spots merchandise tie and you have to push back everything else And that starts costing big dollars It's like getting married We had to book our venue almost a year in advance If we'd asked the venue to move our booking back a month at the last minute they would've just laughed because they were probably booked solid every weekend for the next year We would have had to surrender our deposit find a different venue contact all the guests which would've incurred issues for people re booking leave flights accommodation etc change everything else celebrant caterers flowers photographer car Games get released prematurely because releases are planned years in advance and companies don't want to go through the expense of changing a release not because people pre order
Yeah but the resolution scale being a hidden option affected by other settings is also a shitty way to do settings on PC I can't find a reason why they couldn't put a dedicated slider for this in the
That logic is pretty shit when talking about the PC here is on Nvidia 88 in fact Further DLSS takes about as much time to implement as FSR 2 0 The only reason this AAA EA release doesn't have DLSS is because AMD cut a check
The windows 10 scheduler to my knowledge doesn't know anything about P E cores It just puts things on cores it's not the opposite it could just be anything and thus be really unreliable
Free for me for buying a 7950x beaming face with smiling eyes It's a deal I was building a new PC speccing it out on MicroCenter while AMD was still offering the freebie on The Last of Us By the time I got my bonus and bought the PC and had Microcenter build it the free offer was Deadfall and Jedi Survivor Honestly I was just curious how it would run on 7950x and 4090 with 64GB of system RAM I do not usually play shooters but it looked good even with the stuttering
Strange I don't limit my FPS but I have an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU and perhaps the problem is worse on Nvidia I take it you have AMD if you are using FSR
Re4 had only Fsr as well But ye shouldn t be that hard to add all upscaling algorithms
on the day of delivery i can guarantee you ferrari wouldnt even be a thing if they handled it like EA handles games
Yeah I m lying you caught me I m gonna continue to enjoy the game while you guys complain The videos aren t 100 of players like are you actually that braindead
It can be enough to push a cpu bound game over the edge or more often it can malfunction and caused issues When it s tested and implemented right it s usually not an issue However we have been in a decade of pathetically weak console cpus so games haven t been cpu heavy So adding a little more cpu load with denuvo hasn t been a big deal Now though well time will tell
But Denuvo isn't causing this So again it's not the point of this post
But we're not joking right now This is a serious discussion
I restate what I said It was a fix for low 8GB and lower VRAM users As the VRAM limit is being neared it would swap out the high resolution standard textures for the super low resolution PS2 style textures so your frametimes don't jump to the fucking moon I don't know how many more titles in the next 2 years need to come out that run like shit on 8GB before people understand the 2015 2022 7 years for those that can't count btw an incredibly long time for computer hardware era of 8GB being more than enough is over
I don't feel bad for them They were warned years ago and they plugged their ears back then pretending not to hear They are doing the exact same thing today and now pretending that it's because of poor optimization
That's a huge leap in logic A lot of people have stuck with Windows 10 regardless for gaming That being said if it runs really well on my 7700X 3080 I have a hard time believing that it runs like shit on a 7800X3d 4090 I did see the video of someone showing that but the video was released before the game so it was clearly missing the day 1 patch that was reported to fix a lot of performance issues
Well to be completely fair here drives are often one of few things people keep and if they find some year old video on how W11 is shit for gaming then there's a good chance they'd still install W10 Still there's something wrong because while the chipset may be optimized for W11 it shouldn't matter this much
But i ve been getting 75 85 fps at 4K Epic RT with the 7800X3D and 4090 and no FSR
High none
Yes it actually is
Ahhh didn t know this Thanks
S 't pre order Do this for 2 games and all the planning will revolve around stability and performance testing as well as opposed to it's compiling fine let's launch it
The game is developed for console first which dose not have DLSS so they impliment FSR Then it is ported to PC but because it already has an upscaler why waste time or effort putting in an additional one FSR works on NVIDIA gpu's as well after all Something something AMD check is just rampant fanboism the reality is the devs were lazy and went for a bare bones port
W10 scheduler was updated soon after 12th gen release in order to better address the big little arch that Intel is using now
Oh sweet
DLSS can be implemented with a Mod it's pretty easy and looks amazing
Well the DF review is out now v uI6eAVvvmg0 v uI6eAVvvmg0 If you don't NOTICE it good for you Doesn't change the fact that it's shit
But it is it always is Games always run better with denuvo removed be it by the developer or empress
Are you sure Denuvo is not the one to blame You would need evidence to say something like this
Gahhdamn
I don't Have never done it even when it actually meant something because games were physical Still waiting for game quality to improve as people like you seem convinced will happen Any more brilliant suggestions
The game is developed for console first which dose not have DLSS so they impliment FSR FSR is still only used in a handful of console games especially 2 0 like we have here Also this is an Unreal Engine 4 game so there goes your 'console first' crap plus this means they have a near one click DLSS plugin at their disposal I don't think you realize just how easy implementation is You basically HAVE to decide NOT to implement it which is exactly what happened here Then it is ported to PC but because it already has an upscaler why waste time or effort putting in an additional one Citation needed on it already having FSR on console even if it is irrelevant since many games that use FSR on console still launch with DLSS AND FSR on PC because DLSS is just as easy to toss into the PC port as FSR 2 0 is and again it has a MUCH larger install base on PC which matters because it is the superior technology FSR is not a replacement for DLSS Even AMD doesn't position it as such FSR works on NVIDIA gpu's as well after all Again irrelevant when DLSS provides better quality on Nvidia cards which is exactly why damn near every non sponsored AAA EA release in the last few years has had DLSS as well Something something AMD check is just rampant fanboism the reality is the devs were lazy and went for a bare bones port Not my fault you can't open your eyes The only reason to implement FSR and not DLSS is a juicy sponsor check from AMD Just pissing away a big and essentially free marketing point for the vast majority of the PC market by forgoing it Plus we once again have piss poor cut down low quality RT on display here as well a telltale sign of an AMD sponsorship just like RE Village Far Cry 6 Godfall and many others They even proudly advertise this sponsorship on the Steam page AMD's site and a few other places It's all right in front of you
Does DF own 100 of pcs Idc I m still enjoying the game And I think you ve forgotten what comment I m responding to the guy is claiming 100 of pc s which is obviously not true and anyone saying the game is running fine for them is downvoted lol Almost like some of you haven t even played the game and are just hating to hate at this point
So you believe that Denuvo causes high VRAM usage FYI There is a long list of games that use Denuvo and do not have this bad of performance Try again until you have an argument that's actually backed up by facts
B S
Do you have evidence to say it is the cause Because we literally have a bunch of Denuvo games that run better than this This game would be an outlier
L 't pre order that but that's the first EA game I bought 2 months and 4 patches later it barely runs 60fps stable 7900x 4090 and 64GB RAM Entire team and EA has moved on from that game That's the first and last time I'll buy from EA Else I'll wait for it come in EA play if it ever does and play for 15 5 years later Game quality will never improve if a game launches like this and more than half the respawn team is already back on Apex legends since that cash cow is literally dying courtesy most of the team was working on this shit So slap a band aid that runs at 60fps stable and call it a day because EA has already made it's money Never pre ordered this game and will not buy until it runs at 4k 120fps at least without any glitches will never happen I don't care and hence I'm okay with not buying Burned my hands with wild hearts and learnt my lesson I already gave you one brilliant suggestion Here's another don't buy shit from EA for the next 5 years Want anymore
Also this is an Unreal Engine 4 game so there goes your 'console first' crap plus this means they have a near one click DLSS plugin at their disposal x200B 1 Epic and Console developers have worked together to make console specific code paths in Unreal E Look at all the problematic ports recently they have all been using Unreal Engine 3 Plenty of games have terrible DLSS implementations it actually needs work to make it look good FSR is not a replacement for DLSS Even AMD doesn't position it as such But Console developers do and that is all that matters x200B They even proudly advertise this sponsorship on the Steam page AMD's site and a few other places No shit that doesn't mean that money has changed hands It means that AMD provided engineers and support for the development Which given all consoles run on AMD hardware makes sense EA did a fucking terrible job that doesn't justify any conspiracy theories you are running around with
To be clear I am not saying it is the cause Both sides need evidence and you don't have it A bunch of Denuvo games running better does not imply anything about this particular game That is basic logic
What a lot of words to say absolutely nothing of worth
Epic and Console developers have worked together to make console specific code paths in Unreal E and you have no proof that this game was 'console first' other than what you've pulled out of your ass Judging by the FPS drops on consoles and the state of the game on PC it's probably suffering from similar bullshit with less overhead and lower expectations Plenty of games have terrible DLSS implementations it actually needs work to make it look good Again its all the same shit you already have to do with FSR The special part of DLSS is not the part that devs screw with Implementation is incredibly similar to FSR 2 0 which they have already done Stop But Console developers do and that is all that matters It's hilariously irrelevant to this discussion and is not supported by almost any non sponsored AAA release in the last 2 3 years particularly by EA No shit that doesn't mean that money has changed hands It means that AMD provided engineers and support for the development Which given all consoles run on AMD hardware makes sense That' money almost certainly did change hands here given the level of marketing despite the current state of the market Intel already has HALF of the marketshare in the dGPU sector that AMD does after about a year of mediocre dGPU sales You do NOT forgo DLSS Reflex potentially Frame Gen which would have helped this game TREMENDOUSLY and the marketing boost that comes with them nor do you gimp the shit out of your RT implementation which was clearly not done for overall performance since its CPU bound not GPU for a GPU vendor that holds a mere 8 of the market especially with a game like 't see that I have no fucking clue what you're smoking EA did a fucking terrible job that doesn't justify any conspiracy theories you are running around with EA did do a terrible job no one here denies this but forgoing DLSS despite them usually having it in their titles as well as gimping RT quality are established trends with AMD sponsored games going back years 've said is ignorant conjecture But ok
4090 so extreme they even overclocked the MSRP
Here in Australia the FE is around 2 959 I can only imagine the AIB prices
Who can buy such expensive cards nvidia really wants to kill their customer base I don't want to know the price in euro something like 2300 Euro
100 sitting this gen out I hope AMD pulls a rabbit out of a hat
Definitely rooting for AMD NVIDIA corporate greed is on a whole other level now
Man I remember when 2000 was more than enough to build a high tier PC Now that's just a video card
The cheapest one on the list 1679 ASUS TUF equates to about 2500 CAD Like holy fuck that s the price of my cats eye removal
Nvidia response Don't be poor
Nope These prices are out of control and it's just going to lead to a crash of the GPU market People are going to look at consoles as a far more affordable choice for gaming and PC owners will just stick to the current cards they have now
What the fuck This is nuts I'm done for a few years lol This just burns my eyes
Not looking atractive to keep buying GPUs from now on Move on to something else Good that I have music Instruments and skates skateboard See you outside guys
Tbh EVGA did a good thing to dip out and not waste a shitton of money on this and end up not being able to move inventory
Lol 2000 pounds for just a GPU for playing games Maybe if u are a streamer or creator or have lots of money
Here's all the RTX 4090's I won't be buying
Redditors buy that anyway
With PlayStations and XBox readily available now PC gaming is looking less and less attractive I could buy myself and 3 friends or family a console for how much it cost for one fugly Aorus Master
Hope they sit on the shelves like lead
Nvidia have lost it back in the day I would always prefer Nvidia But they have just completely taken craps all over normal customers and served a 3 course meal to scalpers etc
nVidia have become the scalpers Fuck scalpers
I skipped the 30xx series going to be using a 2080ti for a while yet I think Doesn't really matter anyway as there are stuff all decent games I want to play anyway If i do want to play them I'll just turn a few settings down problem solved
Perfect product for a recession where everyone is unable to afford anything due to skyrocketing energy costs
What the actual fuck 2000 has been broken
Comedy gold But don t worry there won t be any to buy They already admitted they ll starve the market to manipulate prices
This is why I hope Intel succeeds with their ARC GPUs so Nvidia would stop this bs
As much as I don t want these to sell I know there are people who will end up buying them
2 000 for a fucking graphics card I could buy a PC with a 3080 for that price
Plus a new PSU don t forget
I'm gonna be sick finally wanted to switch froma 2070 laptop this
price drop down scalpers disappearing Nvidia I am the scalper now
Lmao that s crazy
I wouldn't be surprised if this goes up before launch the value of sterling is crashing right now
I can't wait for EVGA's 4090 KINGPIN Edi WHAT DO YOU MEAN NVIDIA ABUSED YOU
Nvidia needs to take a long hard look at crypto prices and really assess how much of their business in 2020 2022 could be attributed to that Gamers couldn't find graphics cards and for the most part weren't paying these prices It looks like they looked at the scalper price in 2020 and made it their MSRP
Hahaha no Sorry Nvidia I don t think I will
I so hope the RTX 4090 has a huge defect and it blows in Jensen's face for being filthy greedy
My unprofessional opinion is that nvidia can fuck right off Now we just need to hope that amd releases some decent stuff and isn t prone to greed But to expect it from a publicly traded company is unrealistic Shareholder value is all that matters I corp America
Absolutely insane
to see prices view a 4090 4080 on O
Oh great the BS with OC and non OC models again without any info on if they even exist x200B Sorry did you order the OC model 2 months ago Oh yeah doesnt look like we are actually making it thanks for stopping by
I ve been a die hard Nvidia fan since the Riva TNT2 card But with these ridiculous prices I think I ve bought my last GeForce card
It appears to be the same shenanigans as the 30 series launches The MSRP models will be in very limited stock and likely wont exist much after the launch window As an example the 4090 TUF models The non OC one is 1679 99 the OC one is 1889 99 guess which one will be in more plentiful stock lol Same can be said for the Zotac Trinity Non OC 1699 99 OC 1859 99 this excludes the FE idk how that will go this time around
By the time the 50 series is here you might get 30 series really cheap LOL
I better do a PC Case dust clean look after my 3070 a lil better
Honestly not a single one even looks nice
If Nvidia's strategy is to get me thinking about switching to AMD it's working
Compared to last gen they raised the price of the 90 100 the 80 500 and are trying to pass off a 70 card as an 80 while charging 300 more Hell no
Laughable
You lost your minds I would never ever put a 600 watts card demanding 3 pci slots Hope you lose money with this generation
The last 2 years showed the industry that people would pay these prices for cards So they just raised the MSRP
Since most of those 2X 3X performance gains are just due to frame interpolation perhaps they won't mind if the pay half the bill with fake interpolated money too
NVIDIA are artificially inflatingthe cost of these things Nvidia can do one for a few more years im just not that interested
Most of these look uglier than the 30 series counterparts IMO Especially the Strix The Suprim looks a bit cleaner Zotac looks better too although I know the design is controversial
Thanks NVIDIA for helping me with my internal debate I'm a VFX professional and I don't care that these cards pay for themselves these prices are simply ridiculous I can have two 3090s for 1800 and that will give me 21000 ish cuda cores instead of 16384 for the same price Two cards will also give me redundancy if something goes wrong Thanks again byeeee
Pretty disgusting
Guys let's be honest Companies that took 1 year to make a polished game a few years back are now struggling to release a buggy mess in The production quality required is going through the roof Maybe it is our time as fans of this medium to tell these companies and these developers that its 't have to push anything further The envelope is straining at this point They should know we can survive on current graphical fidelity standards that they don't have to grind endlessly for hours just to make that part of the presentation perfectly hollywood The audience adapts based on where quality is and quality is much more than just insane graphics and perfect cinematic presentation Elden Ring is a perfect recent example of that Of course no company will let another steal attention by releasing better
Half the people here acting like you all need a 4090 and without it you are all in on console gaming now And the other half huffing so much copium saying Nvidia will die now because you personally can t afford the highest end card anymore Meanwhile Nvidia made over 2 billion just selling software and cloud that doesn t include any GPUs The circle jerk of bad information here is at an annoyingly childish level But go off downvoting anyone being rational and not just screeching
Aye until the website crashes and the cards reappear at 200 extra
It was only a few years ago you could make a high end system for that money
Remember when OCUK used to be good When they weren't money grabbing bastards
All those people who were talking shit about people buying 3series for msrp really biting their tongue now Lol
I hate to say it and might get flamed for it but this is why consoles compete Are they as powerful No But at their price point it's difficult to justify PC part prices
DLSS 3 0 AI upscales your price
That's gonna be a nope from me dawg
Yikes These prices are outstanding of control The GPU market is going to crash right along with the encomy Nvidia should be fine though since they are involved in other sectors
Bye Bye Nvidia Hello intel and AMD
Money I'll be spending on a 4090 is exactly 0 Still can't believe I paid what I paid for my 3090 and Opty block
This just makes me feel better for grabbing a 3090 for 800 even if novideo says the 4090 is literally twice as
I can wait till we see big discounts Not paying more than 1k usd again for a GPU
My trusty EVGA 1080 will keep my rig going until further notice Hope team red has some better offering this winter
Don't forget these prices don't include the PSU upgrade case upgrade in case of size better cooling upgrade electric bill increase etc And with AM5 on the horizon would be dumb to do it now until it's out and matured I'm still rocking my Asus GTX 1080 ROG Strix and will do so until 2024
damn my main man zotac ALMOST making the cheapest too bad I'm buying last gen anyways no game today needs a 4 series
The prices are crazy insulting even Also who needs one of these Which game released or to be released is going to push graphics so far that you need this I am a VR user for flight sims and I don't even need this I can do fine in IL 2 with a 3070 Ti
Totally absurd prices and waste of energy
I guess anyone earning over 60k a year can buy one with yesterday's tax cut
Got to wonder what it will cost to game on a 4090 for 20 25 hours a week with UK electricity prices
These cards are fucked You need to upgrade your entire PSU to avoid fire hazards with their retarded 16 pin connector
Every partner s design team sucks
The fact that there's such a big gap in prices for the same chip seems absolutely ridiculous to me I kinda get it if it's watercooled and even then we're looking at a 500 pound difference here These cards aren't tied to value at all anymore and it's a bit concerning that they'll probably get away with it
Remember after buying these cards you still have to pay the electricity bill
Overclockers is a trash company I'd rather shit in my kitchen sink than buy from them But the GPU prices are entirely our fault People bought at scalper prices and also bought from price gouging retailers So now both nvidia and AMD will charge the earth because they know that enough morons will pay it to make it work Say goodbye to high end PC gaming if you're on an average wage this is normal now
fuck Jensen
Jeeeeeessuuuus who wants to buy this stuff Worst part is that there are people with a fucking 3090 and is like Yeaaah I need a 4090 to play fucking minecraft comfortably Don't encourage this stuff
Fuck that No thank you Straight up money grab Hopefully Nvidia learns something and fixes their brains for the 5000 series cards I can't figure out how we can go from like 400 MSRP current gen on some cards to 1899 MSRP
Why wouldn t you just buy a console at this point
Here s a all the genius people out there that skipped the 30 series because the 40 series was getting ready to come out beer mug I still can t figure out why anyone is shocked at these prices The writing was on the wall the entire time OK hand medium light skin tone
hard pass
4090 Strix being north of 2000 2118 assuming a straight conversion is disappointing I guess they've permanently planted their flag north of 2k as a result of 2021's supply chain issues
Yeah no It made sense when there was a shortage But now I can see why so many are skipping this wave
Hopefully these are just early adopters prices and we ll see major decreases early next year There s no way they can actually sell these cards
The high supply cost because of the ridiculousness in size If I'm not mistaken every 4090 will take up 4 slots
It doesn t help that all the AIB designs are ugly as shit It s almost like the board partners collaborated with Nvidia to make 4000 Series unattractive in every sense of the word
get these AIBs and nvidia some help they've gone off the bottle and taken to huffing spray paint if these numbers are accurate
As always I will always wait until they become 799 or less when the next gpu is out Thats my threshold limit for buying a gpu
They looks so ugly I miss EVGA Hope someone treats them right
Lmao no one will buy these
I ll wait for the EVGA card
Naah gimme prices of 4060 and release it soon so prices of 3060 fall down and I will finally be able to buy solid 1080 used
Good things the only good games coming out these past few years are not the gpu intensive AAA jesus
WTF
Good riddance to pc gaming
My Strix 1070TI looking better every day
Price them so high to guarantee the sale of every 30xx card Then reduce 40xx prices
Soooo 3000 series then
Good time to pick up a used 3080 seeing these prices I just picked one up off eBay for 500
Built a new rig for 1200 euro only thing I kept is my this time I wanted to spend 800 euro for a 70 80 tier now they are asking double 's just
Gone back to consoles until the pc market sorts it's crap out
Have a look around overclockers have always been an expensive site to use not massively over but enough for me to never buy from there Ebuyer is probably the cheapest place consistently and it really helps when they run their price match schemes find it cheaper they give you a store voucher yuck for the difference I have never been able to use that service as they were usually the cheapest place around when I want to buy a particular item The last thing I bought was a 3070ti amp extreme holo zotac Ebuyer had it for 779 whilst other places were still around 799 840 The annoying thing about that is a week after purchase Ebuyer dropped their prices again to
Can we start voting with our wallets Just skip this gen Nvidia always get away with this sort of shenanigans cos of their mindshare
I'm waiting for the EVGA FT
Gpu manufactures are killing pc gaming
My last pc I built with a 3060ti 32gb ram and a 5800x cost less than all but one of those cards Taking the absolute piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss

Don t buy Nvidea
This is a good time to buy 3000 series cards Just sayin'
Lmao you could buy a beater for those prices wtf
2k for strix Fk out of here How do you add 400 to the FE
RTX 4090 equals my networth car and laptop included What the actual
2 grand Stick it up your arse nvidia I'll stick with my 3080 I got for 649 and purposely won't upgrade for years
UK is completely fucked nvidia thinks this is ok lmao I could buy a minimum of 3 cars for this price
I will just go on pretending this gen doesn't exist The 4090 price is bad as expected but then you have the 4080 real one at 1200 several hundred dollars more expensive than previous gen Wasn't the 3080 like 700 msrp If you're EU then it's even worse with founders edition 4080 at 1500 and we can probably expect good AIBs to be at least 100 200 more Absolutely outrageous I think for anyone with at least a 2000 or 3000 series GPU their money is better spent on one of the new CPUs are that are coming out That's what I'm gonna do anyway As for my next GPU upgrade in a couple of years I'll probably go AMD unless NVIDIA's market crashes and they are forced to come back down to earth
What is the fucking point of buying this when there's no game good enough to justified the upgrade
So it's extortion
Hodl gaming apes Hodl
I am blessed that I just got a 3090 for free these prices are pandemic miner level but without the pandemic or miners ha
Are these all accurate VAT is 20 right The Inno3D is 1 679 99 Euros which is nearly 1 to 1 with USD so wouldn't this put MSRP way below 1 599 99 USD MSRP What am I missing
That's ridiculous I paid 1700 for my suprim x 3090 at the height of the shortage and that was bad enough 1999 99 with no shortage is beyond a joke
To be honest I expected the prices for these gpu would reach 2000 it s no surprise
Maybe I'm wrong but doesn't it make sense that nvidia would sacrifice the 40 series of cards to avoid a financial cataclism due to an excess of 30 series new and used in stock With this they avoid their main concern which was the flatlining of demand for 30 series card Maybe when thise stocks will be gone they will review pricing of the 40s cards
Most of these cards are fuglier than the prices
Why do graphics cards keep getting uglier
Maybe we can vote Nvidia as worst company of the year That s a thing right
Yeah fuck these prices 899 for a 4060 4070 12GB nah
aahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahhaaaaa Aaaaaaahhahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahaha AAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAA
For everyone complaining about prices please think of the shareholders EDIT for nuance s
NVIDIA look at me I m the iPhone now pirate flag grinning face with sweat
I really wish people would stop complaining about the price at this point It s annoying that every other post is omg the 4090 is so expensive Please stop You were never planning on upgrading from you GTX 780ti to begin with
Nah I take an AMD thanks smiling face with smiling eyes
2 045 1982 currently You'd paying nearly as much for a GPU that lets you run a game in 4k at 60fps maxed out with RT as the average person pays for their mortgage for a 2 000 square foot house BRO ARE YOU HIGH
I see two at MSRP the TUF and Inno3D Assuming they have adequate supply the TUF is the killer card here
I bought a 3090 I think I might skip this gen The game I play the most destiny 2 doesn t even support dlss or Raytracing unfortunately or the steam Dec bungie sort it out
sigh i miss EVGA already
Yup that looks like classic Overclockers to me Don't buy
Are there water cooled 4090s Price on these
My only question is who REALLY wants graphics better than the 30 20 series so much that they want to pay this Crazy
2000 GBP 2169 00 tax and these are the market entry pricing not even TI pricing either
No thanks I ll be buying my first ever AMD card
honest question
Christ on a bike
People crying about 4090 prices as if you have to buy it Buy whatever card is in your budget folks Cheaper stuff will come out eventually or just buy last gen cards
Soooo they don't want us to buy cards Is it just a contest on how much they cost Well you did 's officially impossible to swing this unless your making close to six figures Don't everyone start clapping just yet I bet they have more prices in store Premium prices They got um all 1 999 2 999 ready for this 10 999 No reasonable prices here just premium
I am here looking at Europeans complain about their currencies meanwhile my economy is stuck in doomsday with prices going up on the daily
I don t see why everyone is freaking out about the pricing of the 40 series People were paying 1200 dollars for a 2080Ti then they were paying 2000 for a 3090 at the height of the mining boom Now people WILL pay 1500 for a 4090 Why the big surprise
Wait Where are the EVGA s Something happened
Can someone calculate possible rtx 4060 price if they release it for EU please
what about freedom bucks
I would buy that I chill one today
Selling at these prices in a landscape without mining profitability to offset the cost is insanity
This is why i pulled the trigger on a 3080Ti a year ago at 1500 I knew 4090 is just gonna be a shitfest and even more expensive
Sold out
Zotac ones always make me giggle They re like boomerangs
I don't suppose any of these would be 300mm in length or under would they
x200B What are the brands to avoid which are the ones that if I see them I should buy x200B This happened during 3080 launch They were selling so fast I didnt know which to get and they all sold out Is it pretty much go MSI gigabyte asus Avoid inno palit zotac x200B If its a rush on launch which are the more desirable cards here x200B Also if possible not sure if theyre releasing in australia is Founders a better option Or are they much hotter running
Yup I am going to need a new credit
Too Bri'ish Can someone translate to English
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAA
Welp I was gonna get an Asus 4090 but looks like I'll be going with FE this time around The insane length of the card is a problem anyway so I need the shorter FE to fit my case
Everyone freaking Tf out about these prices but it includes VAT guys
1680 is very cheap compared to Romania MSRP of 1717 I expect what passes for 1680 for you guys will pass as 2200 for us
Soon our disposable organs wont be able to buy us a gpu
Ill probably pick up the Gigabyte version
If I have a 3090 and I wanted a 4090 what requirements would I need to run that 4090 New motherboard New CPU
why is every single one of you acting like youre forced to buy this If it's too expensive just buy a 3xxx if not stick with what you have
Always buy the founders edition from scan AIB s suck value wise I have no idea who buys them
One of those is cheaper slightly than I paid for my 3090 and the rest aren't much more The difference is that it presumably isn't going to be there only card that's in stock anywhere so you don't have to spend that much anymore
Why are people freaking out over a XX90 card which basically replaced the Titan and clearly was always meant for enthusiasts being expensive This isn't the first time GPUs have been this price and there were Titans previously that were MSRP at like 2 500 Are people really so entitled now that they should be able to get a 4090 as if it was for the common consumer
Highly skeptical Those are likely just placeholders until they get cards from the manufacturer and are actually for sale
Reasonable I guess The 3090 will get a new home once I buy a 4090
Wasn t the 3000 series more expensive though Isn t the 4090 cheaper than 3090ti was just until recently even though it s supposed to be much faster
LMFAO Yeah no
Yours for the low low price of just two thousand pounds
Do you think prices of 30 series will continue down in late October
IF I was to get a 4090 ain t going above 1700 but Jesus these prices are fucked nvidia need to be taught a lesson
How did you get them to show up No prices for me
How the fuck is Asus tuf cheaper than all of them Asus becoming the 1 brand since EVGA left
I better start saving now so I can afford a next gen GPU when the time comes
Ouch
Oh look at all the graphics cards that I can't afford And did we just go back in time Wtf are these apocalyptic prices
Not bad If I can still pull down 2 a day mining I can break even in 94 950 days
The crazy thing is that they will be all out of stock within seconds
I was hoping ASUS and EKWB would team up again
loooooooooool fat chance
L o fucking l no
These are cheaper than the 3090 was at launch here in NZ so I'm fully expecting the 4090 to cross the 2 5k 5K NZD mark here This might be the first generation where I don't pick up a single NVIDIA card for our 4 builds
And the FE looks the best out of all them and is the cheapest lol
Is there a list where I can find the dimensions power connectors of all 4090 s that are gonna release
Just wait until the scalpers but it out and have prices fall Eth went proof of stake and crypto is falling so not much miner support
LMAO
Still not available herebut when it does it'll probably be around 4000 euros 3090 costs between 1800 and 3000 here depends on branding and if it's a founders edition or not
These are just placeholders if the drops more against the then the price will rise
So roughly 1700 2300
More like overclocked price
HAHAHA
Two grand TWO GRAND I want to live on that planet but it's awfully far expressionless face
Off to sell some internal organs so I can afford it
Sheesh Why is the Asus TUf and strix so far apart in price Strix line up that much better
Why are they so cringe
Got a link for this btw Can t find it
Hollydays soon then should add something to those prices
Even if you are being able to afford them they are just absurdly expensive I expect AMDnto release something competitive and then nvidia to undercut them or something like that With that being said Ill be waiting for the 4080 Ti I play at 1440p and the added vram is not worth to me since I dont work on rendering jobs That said some guys at my work I work at EM are going to jump to the 4090 on first day like they did to 3090 and 3090 Ti When your rendering time is money and your time is expensive this things paid for themselfs in less than a week
Amd looks better an better Sad
Im gonna gold on to my 3070 more tightly now Might gonna give it a massage and try to offspring several 1070
4090 FE or nothing until 5k series I guess
God damn you ROG tax
Got a 3080 I can wait until this thing adjusts to reality They were already overpriced before 4x
Scalpers be holding nVidia's beer
2k bruhhhh
why is the Gigabyte Gaming OC the same as an ASUS TUF isnt gaming oc one of the worst AIB cards you can get
I'm going to build a pc hopefully this year but this has put me off abit I wanted a nvidia card for dlss and better rt performance but with what people are saying about dlss 3 0 and these ludicrous prices I'm hoping amd comes out with something more reasonablely priced even if it doesn't perform quite as well
that s an entire alienware prebuild price right there
How much do we reckon the 4080 16gb and the 4080 12gb cough 4070 cough are gonna actually be for the aib models Atleast for the basic ones
Nothing in white broken heart
Haha this will be big disaster let me tell ya
I ain't payin' that
Hey put me down for 2 face with tears of joy The price almost matches the base clock per Mhz
Over the last decade my cards have all been NVIDIA specifically EVGA 980TI 1080 and 3080 I won't be buying a card for several years but when I do I will remember this time and look at AMD purely out of spite
Suprim x or strix oc here I come Who has suggestions on how to actually get one of these suckers within a cpl weeks of launch for 2k
Gigabyte with the most expensive one lmao
Lol how is the TUF basically the same price as rhe Zotac Talk about a no brainer IF one was buying
My 2080ti will be fine for another year These prices are just ridiculous
4000 dollar pc s series
Nothing like overpricing your tech douchebags
I'm ready to buy
Dafuc crazy
Ok so I m curious since the 4000 series is being released how much do you guys think the 30 series prices will drop
This is why I hope Intel succeeds with their ARC GPUs so Nvidia would stop this bs
Since I don't know a lot about stuff like this besides the driffemt companies making the card what's the reason 9f the price difference of the cards with same specs THANKS
This is nice and all but can we get the same picture with actually affordable cards
This is nice and all but can we get the same picture with actually affordable cards
My 3090 about to shoot back up in value
Nahh I m good with my 2080 super
Holy molly
Yup
I had prepared to pay 1000 for a 4080 but it costs 1500 No I wont buy the gimped 4080 not enough of a perf gain compared to my 3080
If you really want nvidia to actually care about pricing then stop buying from nvidia unless you absolutely need to
Are they smoking crack over there
At first I was like fuck yeah then I was like
I'm not selling organs haha
Why are they all different prices Does it mean they are different despite showing the same numbers or is it just lower prices to under cut another seller
Yikes Watch those prices drop when no one actually buys them Lol
That's like the same price as the rest of my PC
Waiting EVGA joining to AMD
nauseated facenauseated facenauseated face
I ll wait to get 4090 for around 1200 in a year My 3090fe will do fine till then
Sooooooooooo to the should I wait till the 40 series cards come out people still going to wait or will you be getting a 30 series
Why are the Asus rog so much more expensive than TUF please thanks
they've REALLLY increased their markup on the PNY which was originally listed for 1679
Pass Wait till next card
2060 for an air cooled version mental
It has begun
There is no such thing as a bad product just bad pricing
fuck this
Even though mining is over we still have those
LOL yeah with those prices only Game Companies can afford it No way in hell im paying more than 1000 for a GPU alone If I'm spending 1K I'm better off getting a alienware pre build using a RTX
Lol nah Keep on chugging my good friend titanxp
900 MSRP my ass Nvidia is screwing over their partners it s honestly so sad
Nah
Bender
Man I've got so used to insane GPU prices these last 2 years that my gut reaction to this was at least they're cheaper than the 3090s were for a while pensive face
In Canada it will be 2500
Is there a dollars version
So about 3000chf in switzerland when they get here in like 5 months great
These cards are soooo GD big and fugly
Crypto go boom the gamers never spent money like that before the miners We were collateral damage They are going to fuck themselves up lol
I haven't bought a GPU in decades they really took off in price
As 4000 series is really going to coexist with 3000 series they should really have numbered these things differently Feel like this would solve some psychological anguish about higher prices too 3050 3060 3070 3080 3090 3100 4080 12 GB 3110 4080 16GB 3120 4090
Welp
Lol
Disgusting
Absolutely fucking not lol
I'm just in disbelief that there is a 380 price difference between some models for the exact same GPU and memory configuration especially when all of them are huge 3 fan designs
Come my little 1070ti you ve got a few more years of life left in you right
where are all the people telling me to wait for the prices of the current gen to come down now
My 3090 does 240fps on most competitive fps with decent settings enabled on qhd 2k 240hz monitor I'll stick with it
Rise of Skywalker did a billion at boxoffice in this timeline so no doubt 40 series will sell like crazy
What's the difference other than price for the 3 Zotac cards
how about the forty eighty and the forty ainty
But PC's are cheaper than consoles
Why do they never make white gpu s
Damn I should I have sold my Nvidia stock months ago I m damn sure sell during the first week sales spike
LMFAO NOPE
Imo these prices are going to go down in a month or so rn they re just trying to squeeze as much money as possible from the people who immediately buy the best hardware no questions asked
How much will a 4080 cost
God the AIB cards look like shit this gen
Hopefully consumers are buying these overpriced cards to make Marvel movies for Disney or some kind of 3D rendering because you damn sure do not need one to play any video game in existence hundred points
Hahahahahahahahaha 's to 3080's There's going to be a huge market for older GPU's
Good thing I bought the 3070 ti and didn t wait
What a shit show
Where the 'Merica prices
We need software devs to build more optimized games rather than relying on electricity and expensive silicon to power through their poor code
cooked
AMD looking real good from now on EVGA getting my money wherever possible I ll buy a freaking T shirt if they make one
Please tell me people will finally have had enough and will leave these to rot on shelves I wouldn't even spend that much on an entire PC The last one I built was a 3800X 3070 for around a grand This is insane
Why is the 4090 on the box so big it looks so weird
Honey get out the kidneys We have a card to buy
This is the first generation in a long time that I feel perfectly fine sitting out until the next My 3080ti is going to get lots of love and repasting
Nvlation
Imagine just changing a number on a product each year and putting it out and loyal people buying it I expect big money for our streaming friends to start influencing us it s a must have
With rising rates their real miner customers won t need them for at least a year Hope they have a whole negative year
maybe im overthinking but 4090 or older titan series gpus were always 1000 or above priced once's again depending gen to
This is going to be the first time I don't buy a card as soon as possible Just going wait for real benchmarks and see if Amd can lower the prices of Team Greens cards Probably wait for TIs as well
As Linus said f you Nvidia
Very expensive cards nowadays
Jesus i wish i didnt own stock in this company
I have literally purchased every single new generation of GPU on day 1 ever since Kepler A whole decade of splashing my cash at Nvidia at the first opportunity I m calling this practice quits with Lovelace now I even bought the notorious 2080 Ti which I later came to regret when Nvidia throughly mocked me with 3080 two years later That experience taught me a lesson and I m going to try to avoid repeating mistakes of the past The 4080 16GB is priced too closely to where the 2080 Ti was at launch so therefore I m reluctant to buy Instead I m going to wait for the price to dip to a three digit figure The so called 4080 12GB meanwhile is a disgraceful product not worthy of the 4080 name A 192 bit bus for 949 is laughable and the CUDA core deficit makes it clear that this is simply the 4070 in disguise I will not be buying this product ever out of sheer principle alone no matter the pricing
So we back to scalping prices
I never got my 3080 from them ordered on launch day at MSRP so I wouldn't hold out hope for the 1 679 99 ones rolling on the floor laughing
TUF come to daddy
the only way that gamers would actually need these is if they were going to get the latest pimax 12k qled vr headset Any other headsets can use a 3080 just fine in VR
Sad thing is people will rush out to buy I m a few years away from needing to upgrade got a 2070S which will last Not touching cards at this price even when I do upgrade Rather go older and a decent price This is just scalping muppets of their cash
Shit be more expensive than my whole PC
Man fuck this All the you tubers shitting on nivida now will still gladly accept samples to do reviews and benchmarks If they want to make a stand over principle they need to boycott this launch Which they won't
So if I got this I d have to spend money on updating other my CPU to not bottleneck and a PSU to give it enough power No thanks I d rather grab a 30 series if I even still played games the same amount
OCUK are very expensive compared to other UK retailers wait for Scan or Ebuyer to put their prices up
Where s the EVGA one heard they make great cards and have the best customer service
loudly crying face this might be less than ideal but 3090s cost MORE than these cards here in india
Just don't fucking buy one you bunch of whiners
lol nope fuck that
Fuck that noise
skull
Which card do you lot imagine will be the fastest
im buying a very good motorcycle for less money after few days do u understand how much materials and work has gone into creating a big motorcycle or a car nvidia are retarded their greed knows no bounds i hope no one buys this garbage
I just bought a 4k capable card for 480 usd lmao 6750xt
F THIS S so glad I bought a 3090ti for 1285 EUR and the price for the same card in my country has not gone up
If they don't lower proces it's team AMD for me which is sad since I've always used nividia cards
Yeah fuck this shit
Whoever buys this is insane
Asus TUF 1679 99 Asus TUF OC 1889 99 Are they really asking 210 more for OC version What the actual
I suspect that the tactic Nvidia has now is to sky rocket prices for new cards and lower 30 series down to MSRP to sell out as much as they can of the old stuff Then once the 30 series is mostly gone they can lower prices on the 40 series without having lost much Of course this will only lead to a flooded secondhand market having to turn their prices down further and so depending on how many ex mining rigs people are willing to buy Nvidia might just be screwed either way
Gross Not worth it
no turbo versions crying face
Me and my 3070 will see you in 2024
As ridiculous as those prices are Let's be honest The people who have the biggest problem With them are the people who have to have the newest flashiest cards I had a 980ti for 7 years Then I bought a 3080ti for 1000 and will have it for another 5 years If you're spending 1700 on a 4090 but you're going to have it for 5 years It's not THAT bad
Lmao and I was sorta regretting just purchasing a 3080ti a few months back
Just straight unaffordable This is out of control and imho unacceptable
For the price of one RTX 4090 you can buy almost five Steam Decks
Then that's one less kidney it is
Yikes wtf are these prices
What kind of dystopian bullshit is this 30 series AIBS had some personality These all look the same boring and a waste of space Don't even get started with the price lmfao
Vile
clown faceclown faceclown face
It looks like a phone from the fucking year 10
One of those or 3 playstation 5's Those prices are all eye bleedingly high
Converted into Euro I'd have to save an entire month's post tax income to afford not an old I'm going to buy a single graphics I don't mean to brag but the one I got already can perform any game I want on highest settings in 4K 60FPS soo
Nah I'm good
My 3060ti is doing just fine I think I'll wait
Nah these prices can shove it gonna get an RTX 3080 and see you when the RTX 6000 series comes out
am i the only one who thinks all the gpus are looking more and more ugly since 3xxx series this photo confirms it ugly boxes without any hints of being pretty asus fcked up completely lol
So u can get liquid cooled cards in US for the price of the 4090 FE in India good to know AMD only needs to make sure a good budget card is launched and they will have the Indian gaming market
Overclockers while usually having stock of a lot of GPU's they're often priced higher than other places Either way those prices are insane i'd much rather just get a 3090 and not need to upgrade for even longer
I could pay rent and have enough to buy a ps5
No one is gonna pay that lol
People who spent that much on GPU should have mandatory psychological
I couldn't see the Recently Viewed Products section page on Overclockers but I could see the prices by either 1 viewing any of the product pages and searching for the following in the page source span class price amount data qa price current 2 viewing the category listing for div class ck product box short description visible listing alt mt 3 For instance the prices for the RTX 4080s listed on Overclockers are KFA2 RTX 4080 16gb 1 299 95 PNY RTX 4080 16gb 1 289 KFA2 RTX 4080 12gb 999 PNY RTX 4080 12gb 989
30 series cards went up in price from the overclockers leak till launch Fully expect the same this time around
Man im so sad MSI did not do a 2 slot Aero version like the 3090 those ar such great formfactors
I bankrupted myself by just looking at this image
On drugs pricing
the KFA2 version looks like a building
Absolutely ridiculous prices EFF u Nvidia
Anyone can explain to me what differences the 4 Asus ones have face with tears of joy Especially how different are TUF and ROG
Yeah for just 2000 you can get a gpu that will be out tech the next 2 year awesome bravo for anyone who trust in nvidia and buy 3080 3090ti
A console is better choice then and you save 1000 to get and RTX 3070
Lol u can keep em all
Ugh Gibbo said these prices were best guesses and none of the board partners have given exact prices yet He also said it will be a limited release with very few units available
I don't believe the nvidia cards will sell much At least the 4070 4080 The price hike is too big AMD won't sell any cards either if they have similar prices They will be forced to Consumers don't have more money than they did two years ago
Where I live it will be close to 3500 4000 uSd so
Just buy a console
But you honestly think somebody would buy a 4090 JUST for gaming Take out those that make money out of buying it YouTubers content creators esports players who else Who else would need 240fps at 4K or push 8K
where can i get the card
that's one decent setup complete with a monitor and peripherals
Used car pricing Absolutely ridiculous
450 for xbox series x then get gamepass The value in PC gaming isn't there anymore considering the majority of games don't even push current hardware Nvidia really are out of touch
nvidia staff are we the baddies
I m confused didn t think they were posted up for sale yet How they get these
Aorus E 2 300 16 9 import duty into EU 2 689 grimacing face
While everyone talking about prices here I am wondering if the MSI liquid suprim is worth it Only a 100 more which relative to the card isn't that much more Probably better components used And much easier to install and maintain than a custom
Dlss is fake fps boost
1 Too much overpriced nvidia greedy ad 2 am i the only one who find each of this card ugly af I waited for the 40 series but now i will go for the 3080 rog strix if i build my pc in the next couple
Scan computers are normally cheaper overclockers always expensive
How much in freedom units
Msi phew
Any listings on Amazon UK yet I can't seem to find any
They're out of their fucking minds
Great at least it will be in stock when I go to buy one
welp definitely skipping this gen
Overpriced overstocked over it
imagine if mining was a thing still these cards would be going for double then this and yall would still buy them
Don't you think it's funny that all those AIBs say they have to increase the price a little over MSRP for their cooler designs and board designs so they give you a 3 slot card for 20 25 more for a card that has about 2kg of metal for the heatsink 3 fans RGB galore mini LCD displays But then they give you a 250g worth of metal open loop water block on a stock board but it's magically the most expensive card in their lineup
Come on AMD Intel and chinese brands this is your only chance
I ll be getting the founders edition
Trash cards
ok time to cop me a used RTX 3090 clown face
It seems as though Nvidia is taking its consumer's down to Poundoncoming fistTown
maybe waiting is the right choice
OW that just hurts the wallet I am gonna be sticking with my 3060 ti for a very long time screw next gen until they lower the prices
Ouch
Of no one buys they ll have to drop the prices Black Friday comin up too don t be in a rush to get we have to fuck them like they fuck us
lol good luck selling any of these in australia that's 2900 bucks no ones paying that it's the same reason the 3090ti didn't sell in any volume here no ones paying 2899 for a GPU
Those cards will cost a year of minimum wage
I am more than happy to keep my 3080 1440p for another couple of years Got it shortly after release but before things went totally crazy price wise I'll never pay prices like these They'll come down or I'll catch up on my other hobbies as my 3080 eventually goes obsolete My card still seems new to me which is really funny and it absolutely runs everything maxed out Unless you're at 4k I don't think these 40 series cards offer much vs the 30 series most people would be better off looking at a reduced price 30 series vs I hope with crypto mining dead in the water that Nvidia get a serious wake up call when these launch
2000 pawns Jesus WTF
What's the smallest size for HTPC I'm thinking MSI liquid or FE
What are the minimum and average wages in the UK now
Remember when a titan was a thousand dollars and we all thought holy crap that's a lot of money Those were the days apparently
Well this is untrue I have been watching OC since the annoucement and all the cards they have added don't have price tags Check for yourselves
RTX 3090 vs 4090
The iChill Frostbite is fucking adorable I have to have it All these AIBs running around with 3 75 slot coolers shipping cards with The Dark Obelisk RGB Support Tower and then you have this single slot half length card I want to see some benchmarks with it first to ensure that it can at least keep up with the TUF and Strix and the Bionic Shark RGB tipped fan blade cooler sporting a mini display and 8 pounds of copper but it looks like way less of a meme even if this would be my first water build
2100 for a 4090 AIO How much is the 4090ti going to be
The prices have already gone up since this post lmao Asus Tuf 4090 is now 1 830 This is exactly what happened with the 3080s at OCUK 2 years ago Every few days until launch they crept up in price
Caseking de listed 4090 zotac for 2300euros grimacing facegrimacing facegrimacing face
They all look ugly as shit FE design is so much nicer
Once the scalpers get them
I see a lot of comments about what PC parts look like I must be the odd fucking one because I could not give less of shit what a GPU looks like as long as the price and performance are right Price ain t right
They have actually gone up from this The strix 4090 oc is now showing as 2299 99 Makes me glad I live somewhere we don't pay Vat
Why don't UK retailers show the prices I fear the prices shown here will be higher as well pensive face
Honestly I'm thinking only way to go with this is liquid cooling They're just too big
I manged to grab a ROG Strix 4090 from OC this morning they fucked up and listed it early lol you guys you need to add 500 1k onto all of these prices D
In the Netherlands I see the cheapest is Inno3d at 2400 and the most expensive MSI Gaming X Trio at 2850 ROG and AORUS are not out yet
So Overclockers oversold the crap out of these cards of which I am one of the suckers who bought one of these phantom cards It only took them three days to tell me this though The email I got only just a few hours ago Thank you for your recent order with OCUK We had a very high demand for the 4090's on launch so we needed to pull the cards from the site for the time being your order has been received however all the stock we had for the release has shipped We are waiting on more stock to arrive the update we have for you is the following We expect shipments by mid November If you wish to cancel please contact our Customer Service team via our ticket support system Link below So thanks Overclockers for not even mustering a simple apology while delaying even telling me this happened for three days while I sat on my thumb thinking my card was on its way Also putting your new ETA in quotes really gives me confidence in what your saying s I wrote back telling them how unreasonable this was and they cancelled my order Classy move OverclockersUK
Horrible website
You can literally buy a car for a price of a graphics card tell me that doesnt sound right
Cheapest card in the picture is 1679 99 Remove 20 VAT 1399 99 Is this close to the MSRP
they wanted to 2X the 3090 TI
no GPU should be over 1000 USD change my mind
Factory overclocked into a mini nuclear power plant
I love your username
Power of DLSS 3 0 Upscaling the frames price and even the 70 to 80
Hate to see it in NZ rupees
Bloody expensive I bought a car for that money Well will look at AMD
4090 Whatever that is crying territory 3K is much of the way to a brand new 250cc motorbike
Yep i was going to get a 4090 4080 Im well off and even i'm not going to reward these prices here in aus it's fucked If amd can beat the 4080 16gb and price it well they have a generation winning gpu on their hands ppl are going to forgo DLSS if they can save 500 fucking bucks and only lose 15 fps
My god lmfao they really don't wanna sell any cards eh
Struth
Same as the 3090 3299 for an AIB like EVGA
Bought a 3080 today cos of 4000 series prices
Have they confirmed we're getting it x200B Can we just get it from newegg
Shocking isn't it I bought a 980ti at launch here in Perth for 1k AUD And I found that to be too high What a joke our hobby has become We are priced out I consider myself a middle high income earner but can't justify a 3k purchase of a single pc component
Its not only that too high energy prices are becoming a factor here and at idle it wont really be an issue but you you are full blast pulling 200w from your cpu and 400w from your gpu with maybe another 50 100w overhead for the rest of the computer monitor VR headset and you put in some long sessions like 6 hours a day for a solid week its about 25kw i think that works out about 5 10 of electricity a week with our sky high prices Its not insignificant a heavy gamer could easily be adding 25 a month on bills i suppose if you can afford a 4090 you can afford an extra 25 a month on electric but what if unit costs double it could be a real problem
4090 FE is quoted at 1959 on nVidia's page Can expect AIBs to cost 100 400 more depending on the model It's silly
Plenty of people They ll sell out Just because you can t doesn t mean nobody can
I It's far from a good deal but that doesn't mean people won't buy them To put it in perspective in the watch world the entry level Rolex Oyster Perpetual sells for like 6000 but because it was in a specific colour people sold them second hand for 35 000 There is no logic to this at all It's just hype Same goes for GPU's and tech in general People will buy them just to say that they bought them
People will just pay monthly
4090 is fine The msrp didn't really go up for it and in fact it sounds like a much better deal than 4080 If I was in the market for a gpu that costs over 1500 I'd actually just go for 4090 over 4080 The problem with the prices is for other models If real 4080 ends up being like 1600 for AIB models and 4070 renamed to 4080 will be like 1200 can the lower tier be cheap enough either I feel like nvidia would literally print money if they sold these at ampere msrp but with these prices they just end up losing this generation
are you forgetting that the 4090 is only for the enthusiasts that have money to blow this is NOT a mainstream card
Y all really need a 4090 or is it gear lust You think 4080 4070 won t be enough Seems like the 4090 cards are for professionals I personally am excited for the 4060
not arguing for the mass just giving my example all i did was save small amounts of money on the side here and there during the 30 series run same thing i did to be able to purchase my 3090 i skipped the 20 series tho so that helped a lot extra towards the 4090 purchase they are expensive yes but not something thats out of reach if someone was willing to save knowing this was coming and we all knew it was coming did we really expect them to release 4090s for 999 or something
Mot every product is for every consumer The 4090 is the best card you can buy Not everyone can afford a Ferrari so they buy a Ford instead If you can't afford a 4090 buy a mid range or entry level
Professionals making 200 USD an hour 3090 4090 isn't a gaming card
It s really not that much people are being dramatic
Who can buy such expensive cards nvidia really wants to kill their customer base I don't want to know the price in euro something like 2300 Euro These cards aren't meant for your average best of the best products from
I could but i won't Same as with 30 series If this continues i will never buy a card again
They still think people are going to mine on them obviously You have no idea how many tech nits I know that are still going hard on the crypto even though they're doing it at a loss I'm starting to think corporations are believing their own fomo that this point
They want to push people to their subscription game streaming service its faaaar more profitable for them Crap to us but we dont matter only our money They can pound sand
We just got a TAX reduction in the UK so these cards are effectively
People in moms basement who will save for months for a year to afford then they realize they gotta eat and then post it to the local buy and sell for 100 less than what they paid Aside from them people who will spend way too much money for tech Think of those who spend 5000 on a Mac
blah blah you already ordered
their lines are crystal clear go to eat the 3000 series your m kers there are no 4000 series for you
They don t care if you do they expect you to buy 30 series cards instead
When it comes to hobbies PC gaming in the grand scheme is very cheap You spend 2 or 3 thousand on a PC and it will last you for 3 4 years if not longer
I can buy them Wont out of principle
Nvidia board meeting Random non CEO pleb What are we going to do Cryptocurrency mining tanked market is flooded right now with cards our best private board manufacturer is no longer doing business with us and we are on the edge of a recession CEO Let's jack up the prices that will work
I m selling my 3080 for 1 200 1 400 so I ll be paying about 200 300 for an upgrade Not too bad in my case Feel bad for anyone trying to get into pc gaming rn pensive face
The wage gap is only getting bigger in the US plenty of people will buy 1 or 2 4090s and Nvidia won't care in the slightest that they pissed off a lot of people A lot of people in the first world make 6 figures
They only want the enthusiasts to buy the 4000 series until the 3000 series sitting on shelves is all sold I suspect they will drop prices at this time Jensen told shareholder that they are not building many 4000 series either it s all a part of the plan
Gotta recoup some of that money they lost giving deep discounts on their 3000 series cards
Unfortunately some PC gamers will use any means necessary just to say they have the latest and greatest I bet most still haven't finished paying off their 3090's
Hot take but this is the the high end card of their new line up and every year GPUs are getting more important for consumers and businesses While a 1090 might've been a card for a hobby gamer the 4090 might be more targeted towards small rendering farms deep learning startups stable diffusion designers or rich 4k vr gamers with ray tracing Most consumers don't need a 4090
Yeah but when has the average video card customer bought XX90 edition cards at launch A good portion of video card buyers aren't buying brand new cards at launch
Game addicts will pay anything to get their fix
It's unlikely they may slightly under cut But amd is a business also and is driven by profits It would be great if they came out and made a 4080 12gb aka 4070 competitor at 499 or 599 or something similar and under cut nvidia but it's likely they will try to price as close as they can get away with
AMD is just a more shitty nvidia Sure they are cheaper but that s because their drivers are hot garbage and there are only 3 game developers on earth that optimize their games for AMD The amount of times I ve had to deal with crashes and bluescreens and all sorts of other AMD crap have made me a tech support professional
Unless you're rendering stuff in a 3d program like Blender or capturing and editing
If AMD is smart they would price their counterparts each 599 799 and 999 This move alone would net them so many Nvidia costumers But let's be honest they will price their cards a 100 bucks less and then act as if they have done the PC community a favour Nvidia is high on the crypto boom which doesn't exist anymore They will probably slash prices once 30 series stock starts going down
It's not just NVIDIA's greed The Pound has lost a lot of value vs the USD same for the Euro that alone is responsible for around 300 extra in the price then you add two years of record high inflation and quaddruple the wafer price for TSMC 5nm vs Samsung 8nm You are getting hammered from all sides and worst of all it's only going to get worse as the war continues to escalate and the economies continue to go downhill I've been waiting it out for two years now and it only gets worse and here I was thinking that the end of crypto mining would make things better again I legit feel like I have to get a card within a few months because if I wait another 6 10 months chances are the economy is even worse the currencies will have devalued even more and my purchasing power will have gone down the shitter
Yup WTF is NVIDIA thinking here These inflated prices are ludicrous I don't see anyone but scalpers and rich people where money isn't an object buying there's no way these prices will be maintained I would be surprised if they don't go on sale soon after release I am definitely fine with my 3080 I bought for 699 in 2020 I would upgrade to a 4080 for around that price 1199 1 A 72 increase in a single gen upgrade for a GPU in the same line Excuse me NVIDIA but no Not about it I do need more VRAM for what I do for a living but not that badly You can keep your cards F U
I wish AMD took ROCm more seriously I had to pay 500 more for a card with 8gb less ram because I needed the cuda drivers
Does AMD have a shadowplay equivalent I would like to switch but always use shadowplay to record gameplay since it works flawlessly in Vegas Pro
Let's hope Intel succeeds too with their ARC lineup
AMD isn't selling their products for half the price they gladly match Nvidias prices and profit too
Pretty sure they are doing this simply to get rid of RTX 3K stock before going balls deep with RTX 4K stock x200B Still super scummy but that's what logic dictates in this instance
Nah you can still 100 make a really great pc for 2000 yes it s a lower tier but the parts you re buying are still way better than what you d be paying for say 5 years ago
Apparently you don't remember Titan being worth 2500 MSRP and Quadro being 4000 2000 is still more that enough to build a high tier PC But since they incorporated the highest tier GPU into the gamer segment you just can't afford the highest tier gaming And that's fine the 4090 is not for you
Poor cat
I think a crash of the entire gaming market is coming tbh like the 83 crash
2020 taught me that desktop PC market will be fucked up for a good few years Grabbed a PS5 and XSX and I've been very happy Both are fine pieces of hardware Amazing what they can pull out
I'm a PC guy at heart but this gen of consoles has closed the gap significantly I currently have a high end 3080 build as well as a series X Other than the additional frames which I love don't get me wrong there is not a huge gap between the both visually like there used to be previous console gens I could happily live with just a PS5 Series X for triple AAA's if the PC market keeps this momentum Hell you can pick up a series X for like 500 I'm sorry but even with a 4090 build it's not going to be 1500 better and that's excluding the cost of the rest of the system new power supply etc This obviously if gaming is the only intention with the PC like me If you have other purposes like rendering etc then it's probably easier to justify the cost
consoles as a far more affordable choice for gaming They already are
I love my PC Been a PC gamer for 20 years The facts that the my PS5 graphics are just as good in most cases I can use KBM where needed and there's less of a chance of compatibility issues makes me question the long term viability of PC as a gaming platform
You can still buy a 3060Ti for 400'ish quid or a 6600 6700 for even less and still get a good 1440p card Used ones go for 100 less and for the 3060Ti 3070 I wouldn't discard a used market where they sell for 250 350 by miners desperately trying to recoup And many those cards will still have warranties
They'll still sell well enough because they're basically competing with Quadro cards in a bunch of usages that are not gaming Compared to those these prices are cheap as hell
No it is not NVIDIA has conceded the 600 game market to consoles Which makes sense They are focused on the high margin premium tiers They're going for the premium high end gaming prosumer engineering professional graphics video rendering datacenter and auto Besides everybody is supply constrained in terms of die volume so they're not interested in going for the value tier aggressively Since that would require fighting on pricing for marketshare due to much lower margins It makes no sense for nvidia to waste energy and time on that segment anymore since consoles are a better value for that gaming segment and iGPUs are good enough nowadays for most business homemarket graphics use cases Nothing personal But some of you are in the earning bracket that is not the target for these products
Yup I'm buying 30x gen They can eat grass Nvidia you ain't Apple
It's inflation People are just realising how much items have increased in the past year Especially with the pound dropping it's even worse This makes sense the MSRP for the 4090 is only a 100 more than the 3090 But in terms it's almost 500 more due to the falling pound
Dude PS5 and even the PS4 Pro have sooooooooo much more value than a PC gaming 3D card nowadays My PS5 and PS4 pro can all play 4K blu rays Can't say the same for the Nvidia 3D cards Forget streaming 4K media is back Just picked up mad max fury road for 5 dollars at target And it's so much fun on 4K I got godzilla 3 pack for 19 dollars on Amazon too 4K bluray There isn't anything really on PC that can justify 2 000 't any other game worth it yet
Surely they will be cheaper next gen After 2 more years of 10 inflation lol
Things aren t become cheaper lol
This guy touches grass
I mean you're not wrong But 'older' gpus still do perfectly well on 1440p or even 4k depending on the gpu My 1070ti still puts out 150 fps on 1080p Rainbow Six Haven't had an issue with any AAA sp games either
Ew no
Im interested in the cards depending on the performance id absolutely be interested in a 1600 4090 if the raster perf was 4x but we all know that will be RT perf this frame adding ai guff real raster perf will probably be less than 2x I'll see how good it is but im not really prepared to pay such high prices for a 4090 if there is no new VR hardware out which means im going to need it the vram upgrade on the 4080 cards isnt a big leap for me and thats a concern now for potentially higher resolution VR in the future 12gb is not something i want to upgrade too i went 8 8 on my 1080 to 3060ti and im not doing that again I feel like 12gb will be cutting it tight for next gen VR headsets I have no qualms about waiting
Right on Being a musician probably better off buying another Gibson Les Paul for that price That is ridiculous pricing
I like your perspective All the folk complains about the price of a luxury flagship item sound pretty trite to me
Yeah it s looking like it I m so glad I got my hands on a 3080Ti not too long ago This will last me at least the next 4 or so generations without needing an upgrade It shreds through 1440p 170hz gaming right now x so as long as AAA games don t change too drastically in the near future I ll be Ight
This was never a good value proposition It s like buying a new phone every year It s wildly expensive and pointless
Might finally buy that guitar
I'll be honest ive used both companies and had a good time with both i cant recommend scan enough though ive had RMA's and they sorted it with minimal fuss Good company at least in my experience it seems like a little thing but they way they treated me as a customer means im always going to consider scan first even if an item is say 10 more than a competitor Being able to pick delivery slots is a godsend too for somebody like me who often works the weirdest shifts
Not called Overchargers for nothing I remember the forum posts for the 1440p 144hz LG monitor a few years back and they basically straight up said We're increasing the price because it's really popular B
I was searching for AM5 motherboard and DDR5 since it's soo close to release date for Ryzen 7000 Check GPU's and then realize the prices were showing up
Scan are awesome used them for years Also used overclockers and while I ve found scan to be better with their service I can t say I had any problem with overclockers They had the better price at the time I used them so my advice is shop around Always shop around
Yeah makes ni sense for gaming as Quadro alternative though they seem really interesting Cheap even
If you spend thousands and thousands of hours collectively playing the games over the course of the GPUs lifespan that really isn't a horrible way to spend your money Are there more cost effective solutions Maybe so but if you spend a lot of time doing something you mind as well doing at the best experience you can get if you can afford it Otherwise you are just shorting yourself out
Tbf used GPU prices have plummeted rtx 3090 going for 750 or the more budget card like a rx 6700xt going for 325 pair that with the ryzen 5600x for 175 and that is an amazing combo imo
so you failed to notice nvidia been moving away from average consumer for years
If they succeed no one would even care about nvidia People here acting like they want them to succeed so they can buy nvidia cards cheaper They won't succeed if you don't buy them
And many of those people already have something like a 3080
Just get a used 3070ti 3080 3080ti or 3090 The market will be flooded with these cards soon and already is to an extent Or wait and see what AMD offer in 5 6 weeks time
If you in UK I've seen used 3070 and ti on cex for around 400 500
This too 600 watts is insane It's a literal space heater now at 1000 watts And you gotta grab a 200 psu Then rewire the whole pc I'd prefer to stick in the 250 350 watt range
Yup I ve been saying the same for literally months and months
Im not so sure its intentional They built a big ass die on a bleeding edge node from a fab they pissed off a few years back when they switched to Samsung 4000 series has Fermi written all over it Hot loud and expensive
SUP that RIM
Rip evga
Yeah I agree Bought a 3090 and learned how to watercool a gpu build a PC from the ground up and that's been the most memorable thing about the entire experience rather than the games I've played with it The amount of compelling games is few and far between And that's the biggest problem If it wasn't for using my PC for VR occasionally it would feel like even more of a waste of money than it already does
They have been money grabbing Bastards for years mate
twice as fast in their cherry picked cases
They're only going to charge what people are willing to pay People aren't so willing to pay these prices anymore Everything else has gotten more expensive the buying power of their fiat has diminished and they still need the other things they need to buy so their leisure spending funds are shrinking these kinds of prices out of their reach
Typical gaslighting strategies
But but my 3090 can barely run Heroes of the Storm I neeeeeed more fps p
I'm sorry your okay with Minwcraft studdering at 360FPS V Sync enabled No thanks s
A console can't hold a candle to a 40 series or a 30 series Nor can you do anything other than consume media on it
supply chain issues AKA cryptocoin crash
they don't want to sell these cards they want to sell the 30 series cards People think they'll make a smart move by buying a 3090 for 1200 thinking it's a cheap buy but the smart one here is Nvidia still getting money and the people accustomed to super high prices
Just picked up an open box FTW3 3090 for 900
I really think people should consider something like a 3060ti if the prices keep dropping and they are stuck on something like a 960 970 1060 1070 Its basically parity with a 2080 super and is close even to a 3070 If you need more you are going to know why and at that level of hardware ie you probably have a high refresh monitor ect you'll be in the budget range of higher hardware its all diminishing returns after the 3060ti imo
3080s and 3090s are the 4070s of this generation
And that's gonna keep costing you
might want to do the actual math on that its 2000 pounds and includes the 20 vat tax knock of 20 and convert to usd and its 1734 or just 130 over the FE completely normal for something like the strix
Becaise Nvidia fucked all of their board partners when they made the FE cards Why do you think EVGA decided to not bother making cards
Waiting to see non day 1 benchmarks since raw rasterizatiom performance is what ultimately matters If its not significant this might be just like 20 series where most of the price mark up goes towards ray tracing dlss but this time instead of pitching it as future tech they try to sell it as if it has already matured and got wide adaptation but frankly outside some AAA titles who bothers implementing it
People already set the precedent years ago when they bought an x80 Ti card for 1400 Oh well You 2080 Ti owners made your bed now we all have to lie in it
I agree but they won't These are going to sell out day one Instead I'll be buying a 3090 or 6900
These are pounds not euros MSRP is 1679
The UK has this weird rule that plays out about 99 of the time that US DOLLAR EURO PRICING is generally parity so if you guys get a new pair of sneakers that are 99 we get em for 99 irespective of the exchange rate it could be 1 5 dollars per pound and it would matter we'd still pay 150 equiv for the sneakers because they will be 99
Not that I trust AMD to not also be greedy but nVidia is making a really big assumption that buyers will stick with their brand no matter what
It's funny you mention this because that's exactly the feeling I got when Jensen kept promoting the omniverse Nvidia wants to be Apple It seems like they want to create an environment for Nvidia fanboys and monopolize the market The omniverse is going to become an actual threat to competition
Gottem
These are going to sell like crazy despite all the complaining So many people out there gaming on 4K 120hz OLED TV's Monitors that will snap them up regardless of price Yes they are very expensive but the jump in performance will be worth it to many At the end of the day if it's too expensive just don't buy
EVGA wanted to charge you more to increase their own margins Companies are not your friend
They would be just as
MSI suprim liquid looks to be about 2000 from what is showed here
In Europe prices are going up daily AND our currency is circling the toilet Trust me this combination is worse than just prices are going up
Who wants to tell them
You mean 4080 6GB version
4060 non Ti I would say 450 500 I highly doubt it will be a 12GB card this time around though I feel like a 4070 12GB might still happen but anything below that is likely gonna get its VRAM chopped
They will be released in november for 899 00 but the name is RTX 4080 12 GB
You got suckered dude lol
I d recommend at least 1 1 2kW power supply preferably with 12VHPWR connection Corsair has a cable for existing units if they use Type 4 Official minimum is 850W
Atx 3 0 psu The new 16 pin plug has a serial buss to communicate with thr psu on high demand throttling preventing saturation of any one line of 12v rails I think your going to see a lot of people hooking these cards up incorrectly and burning shit
Because the 4080s are just as fucked up price wise
Username checks out
check the cards then go on to the overclockers home page to view recently viewed products and it should show the prices
They might sell out on day 1 especially if NVIDIA has limited availability on purpose to try to keep the prices high but they won't sell out for long They are just too expensive
Only time will tell But the prices arent that far apart its just the non OC TUF looking competitive which who knows if it will be sold at any volume if at all Same thing happened at the launch of the 30 and some waited months only to be finally told that stores just were not getting any stock of certain models The price diff between the TUF OC and Strix OC is just over a 100 which is about what you would expect There was next to nothing between them for Ampere but its not to say if that will still apply here I do know the Strix cooler has the heat pipes milled into the cooler for better dissipation which wont be done for the TUF But other than that gotta wait for reviews to know more
Each company does its own tweaking of the base GPU PCB and builds their own cooling solution onto it to achieve different levels of performance Generally the better the cooler the more they can squeeze extra perf out of the device and the more it costs or is worth
They will still sell out Gaming was never a cheap hobby to begin with and Nvidia knows their target demographic I mean if someone is willing to spend 1 6k on a GPU they are willing to spend 2k probably
1200
You can convert it almost 1 1 A Euro is 0 97 dollars If we remove the 20 Value Added Tax these cards range from 1399 to 1699
Yes they are and this pricing isn t even the worst it got for the 3090 etc I got mine at 2800 and that was 5 weeks into release then they shot up to the 4K mark there abouts
Nvidia High enough
thats 1519 USD
Under msrp technically with the current pound to usd conversion
It s below MSRP
Very strange to see GBP written with European delimiters
Pretty sure msrp includes vat tho
But the MSRP is supposed to include the VAT in Europe The US is the odd one out with it's go to the checkout to actually see the full price scam
MSRP includes sales tax in the UK though so why are you removing the tax
But thats the non OC TUF variant its basically exclusively launch day SKU it will never be restocked just like happened with 3000 series one
That's the 4090ti still coming The 4090 was always 1 66x the speed of the 3090ti according to 3D Mark leaks for the last 3 months Nvidia marketing slides on the 4090 were filled with BS like always though
Gpu prices will be whatever people are willing to spend I don't even blame nvidia for this I blame tge idiots that voted with their wallets during the pandemic and clearly showed they are more than happy to pay 1200 for a 3070 I have always refused to spend more than the price of a console on a gpu and if more people had this mindset we wouldn't be having these prices now
Name me a company other than TSMC or Samsung that has the ability to print 4 nanometer lithography Intel doesn't start until next generation 4nm is 4 billionths of a meter Human hair is 75 000nm blood cells are around 7 000nm The common cold is approx 15 30nm Silicone atoms are 0 5nm making the process circuits 8 atoms wide They manage to do this while packing 80 Billion transistors into the chip for comparison Intel i9 12900K has only 10 Billion Your GPU became the biggest computational device you own a long time ago and why they absolutely slaughter your CPU on many tasks That costs money and a lot of it It isn't just linear with the performance gains over the last generation card It's the law of diminishing returns and you're talking about exponential price increases for equipment AND YET prices for cards have stayed relatively stagnant A Geforce 2 Ultra was 499 20 years ago and 860 adjusted for inflation now TSMC's newest fabrication plant cost 21 Billion dollars That's as much as drilling the Chunnel from the UK to France This is 1 10 the entire Apollo program to get to the Moon The vast majority of that is not the building it's the machine that does the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography EUVL The only company in the world that provides that equipment is ASML from Netherlands and it took them 20 years to figure out how The process is done in a hydrogen near vacuum with a laser that uses 1 31 Megawatts of power The requirements and difficulty also mean that it fabricates less wafers per hour as well about 1 6 per day compared to older processes I'm as tired of every company nickel and diming us to death as everybody else but when a mass consumer product is the absolute bleeding edge of technology expected to be pumped out in the millions it's not going to be cheap to get there FOMO makes you feel everybody and their uncle have the newest and greatest card but it's just not true Most people won't even consider spending more than a xx60 series card and even using steam as a judge there's only about 600 000 3090's in the wild with 120M users and a 0 50 adoption rate For perspective there are about 12 13x that many 1060's and 1650's in use each Fully 25 of the market is made of of 1050Ti 1060 1650 and 2060 30 if you throw in the 3060 3060 mobile Those are the top 6 by usage The 3090 ranks 43rd right behind the ancient GT730 a card that only supports PCIe2 x8 and is 5 generations older with 1 of the performance For those of you on team red the 3090 has outsold the entire 6000 series of AMD cards with the 6600XT coming in at 47th 0 36
Even the ones used for Hollywood Studios rendering CG movies This is the 4090 That gamers use this stuff at all is a reflection of people being willing to spend this much money as these higher end cards were originally designed for content creators and developers Back in the day I was barely even aware of the super high end cards like the Titan or whatever I would just upgrade to the 70 cards right as the next or two generations out cards hit the market and the price dropped off I never paid anywhere near 1000 That's still more than possible You just have to not buy the top end stuff right as it comes out If 1000 is an amount that makes you think twice then buying these cards the day they release isn't a good idea for you And that's fine
ENHANCE
Unaffordable lol
RIP my wallet are we likely to see them same date as restof world here in little ol nz
I hope amd doesn't just price match nvidia like they did with 6000 series
or a 800cc used one what im buying monday
3k bought me my first bike a 650cc AND my helmet No fucking way am i spending that on one GPU
Well not like evga
That s what Nvidia wants you to do
If you re from Au Nz you can indeed get it from Newegg
And then there's me perhaps one of the only people noticing that the gaming market sucks anyway and even if you afford these things it's still a big rip off Oh and for the booming indie scene you don't need an Ada graphics card
I live pretty frugally which is why i can afford the pretty high end used to be lol hardware i have im by no means rich 10 here 5 there 50p here etc does start adding up over the month milk seems to have jumped again here a good 30 40p i can afford it but its not a good situation my bills have easily jumped up 25 or more granted i had the overhead buffer to absorb it as i really do live very frugally but a ton of people will be going into this cycle christmas winter already redlining finances due to the pandemic and wont be dropping 2k on gpus even a new console like a PS5 Xbox Series S will be a hurt at christmas I suspect nvidia wont sell many gpus and microsoft will sell a shit ton of xbox series s consoles 250 over the Series X 450ish
Moore's law's dead
Its not insignificant a heavy gamer could easily be adding 25 a month on bills i suppose if you can afford a 4090 you can afford an extra 25 a month on electric but what if unit costs double it could be a real problem I would argue that if someone is spending their time gaming for 6hours a day everyday and pushing both their CPU and GPU to their limits at the same time which rarely happens Then 25 month is extremely cheap compared to everything else you can do in this world A cinema ticket is like 10 then by the time you add on popcorn drinks and fuel to get there There's 25 there in the span of 5hours A premier league 2 3x that and for 25 you only get like 4 pints
Good thing winter is comming With current gas prices an electric space heater is a good investment
You're gaming 6 hours a day
Is there a website on working out pc power draw I have a Ryzen 5800x and rtx 3060ti 16gb of ram etc
This is why I'm not even considering the new 3 4000 series Their power hungry Not only xx90's but even the xx60 70's And I have 2 pc's in my room one for me and one for my gf Having 2 of these fuckers would hurt the electricity bill
Prices are WAYYYYY higher than that
The 4090 is 600W I believe
What costs more is trying to cool that now 600 700 watt space heater dumping that into your room while it's 30C outside
Honestly bro you think 25 dollars worth of electricity is a deal breaker or not A person who can't afford 25 bucks on bills is not buying a 1600 dollar card they are buying a used 200 dollar card at max No one should be scared of their electricity bill if you are then you need to move or get a better job or reevaluated your life If everyone doesn't take action they will forever be stuck in that mold and be okay with making barely enough to pay the damn electric bill People need to wake up and demand better pay or quit their pos job suck it up and then look for a long lasting good paying job
The euro lost about 15 of value compared to the dollar in a year time so the dollar price euro vat no longer applies unfortunately
I 't too surprising fo me
wtf I thought they were supposed to be like 1600 MSRP for FE cards Isn't that like 1650 Euro Why are they charging 1900
This will limit buyers for this market cycle
can you link me the nvidia FE store page please
Except it's nothing like that at all A watch will hold value way longer than a GPU A watch won't suddenly stop running the latest software Watches can and will be collectable commodities within a certain community and your price will likely increase year on year post production Those GPUS will be worthless in five
Apparently the 4080 and the other 4080 are enthusiast pricing as well
Yeah but the prices for the tradionally more mainstream 4080 and 4070 4080 12GB are equally ridiculous
To be fair Nobody should be buying any version of the 4080 until the early adopter tax is removed 4060 with dlss 3 0 should be sweet Fingers crossed
I don't need the 4090 specifically but I need an upgrade I want the 24 GB of RAM for AI stuff so it's either a 3090ti or a 4090 for me The 4090 is better enough to be worth the higher price The 4080's price is a punch in the gut I would maybe wait for 4070 if I wanted good performance at a reasonable price
I want 120 165 FPS at 4k so yeah I would like the 4090 for that 4080 16Gig is fine too but I rather spend an extra 300 400 for the 4090 considering the massive jump in performance from the 4080
Y all really need a 4090 or is it gear lust For me it's gear lust a bit of it being useful for work and the fact that having a 1k custom loop as is makes it much easier to justify tossing the top end card in
1080ti is that Honda Civic that will be running 25 years from now with zero oil changes
Who
For reference I need 3 2080's at work to match a single 3090 The value of a 4090 is great if you need Cuda It's practically magic fairy power and pays for itself in a day A PS5 looks just as good on a TV as a PC and it's 500 That is where gamers should be spending their money Killer value
Can confirm I have EVGA 3080ti FTW3 Ultra for gaming and it easily can handle any games in 4k with intensive graphics like Control and Cyberpunk 2077 Anything more than that is just pointless for gaming unless you planning to game on 8k on max settings
Wdym professionals They I'm confused no one makes 200 hour designing fucking graphics cards lmao That is an overstatement and yes if it's not a gaming card why did they show gaming performance benchmarks instead of showing things like blender improved rendering times or daz3D Their profits aren't more than 100 200 graphics card sold So why buy theirs if you can just get founders base price because pricing is already a massive issue
First world problem teens not gonna like that take
A chess set is 20 But you need a friend
Not really GPU's are now the main computational component for many work loads CPU just runs your O S things are changing quickly Gaming will be a minority for GPU's if it's not already
To expand on u judasbrute there are a lot of professional applications that utilize GPU's A TON in ML training and there have been some solid gains the last few generations in their cards and if the RTX 4090 holds true then for many workflows and places the card's price is still attractive Not that I would typically buy it for my personal use but a 1 600 2000 expense on my work budget every 2 years that can drastically increase the turn around on training and improve features from quicker training and testing larger models is EASILY worth it Been putting this for a while but the RTX 3090 4090 has essentially been the poor man's quadro as in a ton of cases it can give you similar to better performance for testing and development and typically be more readily available and cheaper I would put this as being one of the larger areas right now driving up Nvidia's pricing instead of making a more middle ground for business they seem to just be raising prices on the flagships to be that tier
It would be great if they came out and made a 4080 12gb aka 4070 competitor at 499 or 599 or something similar and under cut nvidia Yes and then Nvidia will respond with new cheaper SKUs causing all of r nvidia to say Thanks AMD for making Nvidia lower their prices 700
Maybe AMD values market share because thats a great opportunity to gain more in the desktop segment
But amd is a business also and is driven by profits You can gain profits through high profits but low sales or via lower profits but higher sales For AMD this would be the perfect time to price their GPUs in line with last generation's GPUs and gain both a lot of sales and a lot of market share If AMD can put out a Rx 7900 that is competitive in rasterisation to the 4090 but priced at the 4080 12GB version then they will make a absolute killing And unlike Nvidia since AMD is using a chiplet design it is costing them a lot less to produce their GPUs so even with the lower prices they would be making a decent profit
Maybe nvidia is keeping prices high as they still need to sell of a mountain of ampere Apparently they have a year of stock left to sell Also the manufacturing costs of Lovelace are apparently higher than ampere they re moving to a same sized die on a smaller production process AMD is likely to be more relaxed but I believe nvidia outsells it 3 1 so its unlikely to be able to scale up manufacturing to meet demand or nvidia is uncompetitive That said nvidia is alleged to have massively overbought TSMC capacity so it is likely to have to cut prices as some point
Idk Last gen AMD charged 570 for their 3070 competitor 6800 and 650 for their 3080 competitor 6800 xt They have 330 and 550 of wiggle room They can raise their prices 200 and they'll still be a large undercut If they come out and charge 600 for a 7800 and 750 for a 7800 xt they'll be highly competitive
Why people think AMD care about consumers is beyond me since AMD has proven that just like any other corporation all they care about is profit and they will take the piss if they can and whenever they're able to
Until they run out of 5nm that they make more margin with CPUs because they normally fill 15 30 at the most of the market
Nvidia would just drop to match instantly They are operating on massive margins right now and have a ton of room to price cut if needed
Unless Nvidia immediately lowers prices to counteract them and now they are stuck making less money I expect the prices to be higher I ll be shocked if prices are more than 200 cheaper than their competitors at the most with the exception of the 7900XT
Nvidia would just move prices downwards and people would buy them instead so it would never happen At least at the higher end they are protecting margin
Actual 40 80 s will be a grand easy The AMD equivalent will probably be something like a 7700XT or 7800 Surely there's no way they'd be stupid enough surely
If AMD is smart they will just make cpus where the margin is Just focus on midrange like 7700xt and forgot the high end People will buy 4090 Just hoping AMD causes a price lowering but not really consider 7900xt Last year people were paying that for 3080
Spoiler AMD wont be smart
Everything I've read is that their cards are much cheaper to produce I'd bet we see prices closer to 200 250 higher than this current generation
Apprantly they are somewhat overstocked on the 30 series for now Like you said once the stock levels drop the prices for the 40 series may drop too but i doubt by much Even if they take 300 off and shout oh youve got a bargain here Your still paying over 1400 And that is simply too much in my opinion
I don't see AMD pricing that high since they shouldn't have as many overstock to get rid of vs Nvidia They'd just have to slash prices after Nvidia anyway would look better and gain momentum if they start out with undercutting where they think Nvidia will land
we have been brainwashed even 599 is way too high for bottom level gpus
I think they will price them at 600 750 800 1000 1100 That's still fairly expensive and they'll be making at that level Abd selling cards 1200 for an 80 series is just insanity level expensive And 900 for a 70 series I remember when those were 350 Cool cards but not at those prices
Can you buy any of them besides the GTX 1650 competitor yet
can you play games besides farmville on it
It also includes a 20 sales tax
Exactly why i dont feel too hard done too picking up a 500 3060ti during the scalpocalypse when they were easily going for 800 and 900 and a 1150 3080ti sure i paid over the odds but considering how bad the supply chain and stuff was at the time i got my 100 or so on each of the prices over what they are now I bought the 3060ti as i was stuck on a 1080 and badly needed the upgrade because VR intended to wait it out if the situation didnt improve and just manage on the 60ti till 40 series ie if something like a 3080 ti 90 ti was still a problem soon as i saw the price fall and i could actually get a 3080ti which was the tier i wanted i thought what the heck i might not get this opportunity again for another 18 months and who knows what will happen with 40 series so i went for it
My friend you vastly underestimate people that are bad with
At the end of the day they released a stronger GPU at a higher price what's wrong with that The only reasonable complaint I see is that there aren't any affordable 24GB cards this generation
4080 16 GB 4080 12 GB is the 4070 based on chip numbering 4060 based on bus width comparing to previous gens
Imagine they actually did get scalped and then selling for 4k lmao
Yes it does and it's not bad at all Used to suck but the last generation or 2 it has been good
Yes it's called ReLive
You have proof
2000 dollars do not make justice when the 80 series in which 99 of this budget's build include is already more than half of the budget
I feel horrible about him Doesn t help his appt is nov2nd
Nah Too many people are into to it now Gaming is no longer a fringe hobby If the gaming industry produces rubbish games people will just keep playing the same old staple games Counterstrike is still topping the play charts year after year
Speaking from a purely game software and I am utterly tired of it We could really use a 't share your opinion that either the hardware or software side is likely to crash anytime soon Gamers are far far too eager to make excuses for bad products these days
It s impossible for there to be a TRUE gaming crash like how there was in the 80s The industry has progressed and diversified to the point where that s not possible especially with things like mobile gaming that are generating a huge portion of the industry profits due to micro transactions However I do think different aspects of the gaming industry can crash More specifically the AAA gaming market Covid did some significant damage in terms of delays and with many games launching unfinished mediocre due to companies relying on patches over time i do think AAA gaming could fall into a bit of a lull
Not likely I don't see a reality where people stop buying games
That was related to software not hardware
The GPU industry always recognizes the potential of a market crash You see there was once a dedicated sound card industry In order to have a gaming PC you needed a good sound card The consumer side of the dedicated sound card market crashed when the hardware performance required for maximum audio quality reached a peak There were no tangible gains enhancing audio definition beyond 48KHz 16 bit audio per channel The processing power to handle such data is trivial today The only way to compete at that point was to make a cheaper sound processor Sound processing is so simple that a sound card embedded on a motherboard has more than enough quality for almost all gamers The only market for dedicated sound cards is audio production The GPU industry took the sound card industry's collapse to heart The whole reason for the shader core design in modern GPUs was specifically for adapting the number crunching performance for general purpose utility If the consumer PC market reached a peak where any further graphical processing power provided no more benefits the GPU industry could still sell their product to other markets
It s not the only crash to happen These prices aren t total greed it s meeting the status quo in a post pandemic world Supply chain issues and an on going war where essential chip resources are
Plus they double as a blu ray player
I also have a PS5 and I'm extremely impressed with it but it's not as good as a high end PC setup And I get it we're talking radically different price differences but it's still there I'm playing through Horizon Forbidden West and it looks incredible in 4K HDR with ray tracing the full package But Horizon Zero Dawn on my PC looks as good or in most cases more visually appealing due to higher framerates when maxed out Yes the PS5 and probably the newest Xbox have incredible power but no they don't quite stack up yet
NVIDIA has conceded the 600 game market to consoles Which makes sense Exactly Which proves my point And it's stupid Nobody wants to do business with Nvidia anymore They used to supply Xbox and Playstation with their GPU's and now they lost them to AMD Nothing personal But some of you are in the earning bracket that is not the target for these products Imagine making excuses for a billion dollar corporation that is pushing for worse performance increases at higher costs 4080 12GB is equivalent to a xx60 TI in terms of performance differentials with the 4090 192 bit memory bus is a joke
Or surely you can save over multiple years instead of buying year to year for that price if it is expensive That's my point If these prices increase i want to use my existing hardware for longer and get more time out of it Edit extra sentence
10 average Most things like food gas materials are up over 40 75 That 10 inflation rate is a big fat lie they tell people so they don t panic They printed money during the pandemic to create a controlled crash of the global economy Anyone who doesn t see that or thinks it s a conspiracy theory needs to do their homework The next few years are going to wipe people and families out There s going to many people committing suicide again like in 2008 Stay strong out there and keep your wits about you Don t give them an inch
Fucking hippie
Yeah i honestly think a 3060ti tier is all 99 of people will need at the high end unless they are doing niche stuff like 4k ultra high fps or multimonitor sim rig setups or high end VR If somebody needs a 4080 4090 they are going to know why
I keep harping on about this but my old rig I did build a new on last year and my husband started playing on the old one with a gtx 1080 i7 5930k is doing well I think I built it in 2015 with 970 card that I eventually sold to a coworker and then bought a 1080 in 2016 or so Memory is foggy about exact dates The only thing my firstborn has had a few issues with handling has been Cyberpunk Granted I did game at 1080p but I'll always love that build Probably even more than my second one for how tenacious it's been
Good to hear I just got a 1070ti on eBay for 125 to stick in a pc I have connected to a TV
My 1080 does just fine at 4k 60 1440p is the real sweet spot though
Funny I had the worst experience with Scan they pretended a completely fucked card was fine and only bothered to replace it when I proved it was definitely the problem Didn't even apologise for messing me about for 2 months
CCL have been my default recently not a bad word to say really I still go for the cheaper of scan ccl on like for like products Only thing overclockers are good for is their connections with peripheral manufacturers like ducky and glorious
Got my 3070 FE from them for MSRP during the shortage 480 no other site had it anywhere close to MSRP
Not sure why you re being downvoted these prices may seem high to us but NVIDIA priced them this way because they believe people will buy them at that price It s probably not fair to the average consumer that was looking for a cheaper option but the enthusiasts that were waiting for a new gen will likely buy them and NVIDIA will have little incentive to reduce pricing unless their sale projections fall short
T 's an atypical market condition Moving forward you think these bastards are ever going to lower prices again Maybe if we all draw a line in the sand and refuse to pay it Otherwise the future of PC gaming is bleak as it looks more and more like an elitist hobby
Fail Fail what bit critical lol
no one would even care about nvidia Nothing wrong with a healthy competition and it doesn't have to be one sided with people ditching nvidia for intel
I hope so I just swept through eBay and buy it now prices on used 3080ti are still around 700 or more Which is absolutely bonkers NewEgg is still holding strong on the same card new at around 850 None of this makes any sense It's like the whole video card market is straight up ignoring the natural laws of supply vs demand Something has to give soon
Even that's an enormous rip off That GPU should be 350 used max It was 500 new two years ago
They're only going to charge what people are willing to pay Yup and people will pay these prices We make up shit to justify stupid things to ourselves every single day and the die was cast for the future of computer gaming back in 2020 Neither Nvidia nor AMD give a shit about what else you have to spend money on these prices are here to stay and the 5000 series card in 2 years will start at 1500 notes at least
Or we've moved to higher res gaming Like 4K and beyond You absolutely would want a 4090 for AAA 4K and above In retrospect it was better to stick to 1440p But the 2000 series prices were still reasonable to me so i jumped to 4k
The crash was this year not in 2021 But the inelastic demand coming from miners had to have impacted Asus's decision making
I bought a 2080 Ti for 1500 Can confirm I will be buying 2x 4090 s within a month of launch waiting as I don t like buying immediately at launch until I ve seen numbers and reviews I ll gladly lie in the bed
Bro I only paid 900 and that was in 2018
This is what happens when I don't wear my glasses thank you That makes sense
Note that US prices don't include tax
Yep even back when it was 1 7 dollars to the pound that was true
Me myself can't wait to play everything at 1080p 360hz I mostly play overwatch but it will be fun to see what Witcher 3 looks like at 360hz
I loled
I am new to this sort of thing I have a higher end PC but I didn t build it and don t know the first thing about the terminology your using Would you mind breaking it down for me
Would you mind breaking it down for me if it s not a problem exactly what I would need Just curious
Ahhh so in cases like this the more expensive it is the more power they were able to squeeze out of it and better cooling Thanks for the detailed response by the way smiling face with smiling eyesthumbs up
Yesterday it would have been 1582 Yeah our economies fucked
i can't believe im saying this
thats 3750 AUD after markup
2064 CAD Unless you were born rich I don t know how anyone can justify spending that
close to 2500 in Australia then
Well is 1679 99 the MSRP in UK
Ok so is 1679 99 with VAT or 1399 99 without VAT close to the UK MSRP I included the without VAT figure because the US pricing at the keynote was without VAT to my knowledge correct if wrong and some have been comparing pricing including VAT to the US MSRP without VAT
these people are to blame but also someone at nvidia is a fucking idiot too Like not even inflation is running buck wild like STD in a dorm and consumers are cutting spending And consumers can just get a 3080ti for HALF the price Nvidia still thinks it's 2021
It was minors
Technically people accepting to buy expensive GPU also serve a purpose in the grand scheme of things They encourage the chips makers to keep making state of the art products Now those state of the art products have prices that keep rising That is not an issue as long as mid cards 300 to 500 keep profiting off the technological advances In the past the switch from architecture were simultaneous across the entire spectrum This generation they started breaking this rule by selling 1660 on the side In the future they may very well keep two different sizes on the market at a given time as would happen if they effectively continue to sell 30 series alongside the 40 series In TV monitors or smartphones for example the scaling down in price at constant performance is slower but is still happening So there is hope to have budget cards still doing better and better year on year
blame miners
It wasn't really their fault They developed fomo They had to bid against the crypto miners that were willing to pay any price But now that crypto mining is basically halted people can make reasonable purchases again I personally paid 950 for an RX 6800 I knew it was outrageous but I have a vr headset and I needed it It didnt make sense to not buy it and not be able to use my G2 It was a lose lose And it wasn't the card I even wanted just the most reasonable one I found And it soldout quickly after I bought it I was lucky that I was able to sell my 5700 xt for like 650 to make it all work But I'm sure many others got stuck having to reluctantly upgrade in that mess
Same date Yeah Price Gonna be fucked up Im calling it right now 2000 dollars off pbtech for the rtx 4070 4080 12gb and at 2500 dollars for the 16gb model
No idea may be able to get them via Newegg though if they don't sell out immediately I won't be buying one though
They will why is everyone randomly assuming amd will be cheap
Congrats Spending money on bikes is way better than over spending on pc parts
Yeah I am from aus x200B Might look into that Would you recommend FE over aib
Medium graphics settings or sell my kidney for a new GPU As you said thank god for indie devs
meh same but theres a few really good VR titles and i'd like the best performance with decent graphics so yeah really i need rasterization power
US consumer debt is at an all time high and Americans have been getting new credit cards at an increased rate recently just to put off insolvency a few more months I'm certain Europeans are experiencing many of the same issues These prices are luxury prices at a time when the average consumer is cutting back on luxury spending By all available metrics Nvidia should struggle to meet their sales targets
I just quit eating so I can get a video card Seems like this is the only way now
Username checks out
Really curious to hear about your frugal life as it s something I m looking into Can you share a bit more if you don t mind Thank you
Apparently nvidia is somewhat overstocked on the 30 series they want to get rid of those first
The pricing has literally pushed many I know back to consoles for the time being I think Nvidia forgot mining is dead
Yea it really turned out to be more logarithmic than exponential lol
Moore died trying to afford these GPU
food prices are going to spike even more next year as it will reflect the current high price of fertilizers
And don't forget the opportunity cost side of the equation If money is so tight you probably need to decrease that average of 6 hrs day down to 5 hrs day and spend that time doing something that will earn or save money It doesn't even have to be working a job to earn money It could be cooking your own food instead of eating out Making your own coffee instead of going to Starbucks Doing maintenance on stuff you own before the break or learning how to fix stuff yourself to save money in the long run Or spending some time looking for coupons and deals before buying stuff Saving money is a skill that takes time to develop too 't know how to cook you will probably pay up for food People getting 4090s for gaming are hardcore gamers Even rich people won't throw that kind of money at a 4090 they would throw it at a pretty Macbook not that giant noisy brick sized GPU People getting the 4090 for gaming are spending tons of hours gaming The financial maximizing choice would always be to quit or drastically scale back gaming and spend the time to earn more money The electricity cost is basically a rounding error compared to that choice
Literally lol My friend asked me why I pay 10 monthly subscription for classic WoW I asked him to name me another hobby that you can enjoy for hundred hours a month for 10
Yes but you gear devalues over time too and you also have to add costs for games If u spent 2000 on a gpu and maybe you can resell it for 1000 you still lost 1000 in a few years depending on how fast u upgrade If you go 5 years with it that's still 200 per year And that is just for the GPU not even other conponents
Yeah I was gonna say might as well just turn off the heater and launch an AAA title on ultra RTX
Not just 6 hours per day but 6 hours per day 7 days per week 52 weeks per year Electricity bills are the least of his issues
Yeah i just googled a quick kwh unit price and averaged out like say a hardcore streamer who basically works as a gamer around 40 hours a week and ballparked it
Taxes included 1650 usual 20 tax on different countries comes about 2000
In the US everything is quoted without tax which is giga stupid and confusing EDIT Makes sense if the VAT is not harmonised for all states Still confusing for non US citizens though
It came out shortly after the keynote that euro prices are a lot more As Jensen said in his keynote you buy more you save more or something Crazy I know he was talking about the commercial stuff still a crazy attitude ha
Nvidia's website says 4090 starts at 1679 I'm guessing that's the FE price which is 280 more than the MSRP of the 3090 FE was at launch
Unless they realise midgen what a clusterfuck this gonna be without cryptowhales to buy their cards
People buying luxury fashion watches aren't thinking often about resale value
A watch won't suddenly stop running the latest software A GPU won't do that either
What came to mind for me reading this was that my gpu might actually hold value longer than my watch because if I had such a watch I probably wouldn t keep it in it s box or the vault but instead wear it leading to high chance of scratches and other signs of use whereas my gpu on the other hand would be kept at all times in a climate controlled room and inside of a dust filtered enclosure
Yeah and the GPU costs 2k not 35k
Well first of all you're wrong MOST watches actually lose a ton of value same as GPU's or other hardware usually does A select few retain value or go up and that's just in recent memory again same as GPU's All GPU's lost their value the second you opened the package at home but then the recent years showed that scarcity boosted prices up by 2x or more I only compared them to show that people will spend whatever amount of money on whatever thing they deem worth it And if you look at LITERALLY the 30 series for the past 2 years it's the EXACT same as the watch marked So please tell me how I'm ridiculous for comparing the two
yep 900 dollars for a poorly named 70 ti series is ridiculous
Yeah THIS is the problem the 4090 being expensive isn t an issue it s supposed to be an enthusiast card the real 4080 being 1200 is the issue and the 4070 being 900
If NVIDIA is to be believed the 12GB 4080 will perform somewhere between the 3090 and 3090 ti That's 4k ultra settings 60fps in any current game That's still enthusiast territory I'm not defending these ridiculous prices NVIDIA is obviously trying to have the same profit as in 2020 2021 so the cards are heavily overpriced but I would call enthusiast segment whatever can drive all AAA tiles at 4k 60 FPS max settings
I didnt realize this post was about the 4080
No they're more ridiculous Playing devil's advocate here a bit though it's somewhat understandable that the near top end silicon is this expensive both from a yield cost halo product and most importantly consumer card with 24GB of VRAM perspective All that adds up to a product that if not priced properly has the potential to kill or severely dampen professional card sales The smaller cut down die X80 X70 should not be anywhere near the X90 but they then almost certainly overextended on 30 series chip production to both attempt to meet consumer demand as well as crypto so pricing the new 40 series cards well above all 30 series offerings for a while will likely divert a lot of people to those cards at least keeping them from being as big of a loss as they would be otherwise Shitty Yes Smart Also probably yes
You mean 4070 and 4060ti because when was the last time an 80 class card only had 60 of the cuda's compared to the top card like even the 4080 16gb has
Remember when the 1060 launched with an MSRP of 250 I feel like the 4060 will cost as much as a
4060 might be another 3060 Ti for 3060 Ti price what do you expect from it since 4080 12GB is the real 4070
More like that nice Lexus you bought for a premium when it came out and will serve well for 25 years 1080ti wanst cheap but damn was solid
then what is 4080 its priced almost like 4090 so for professional its better to just pick 4090 and for gamer its ridiculously overpriced
Lot more options during steam sales vs 60 70 per game on ps5 I have hundreds of games i couldn't afford on a ps5 Not to mention just pirating a game for a bit for a demo Like Zomboids is amazing so i bought it to keep up with the updates
Not if the games cost as much as they do on a console still better to be a PC gamer with the discounts and longevity of PC games I think AMD is going to be where its at for the more cost conscious gamers who don t create content unless AMD step it up with CUDA competitor
What do you do for a living then
PS5 GPU is about 4 times less powerful than 4090 And it's absolutely not killer value PC with equivalent used 2070 2070 Super will cost about the same
Not with Ray tracing and native rendering though
I can't perceive an improvement over 1440p in gaming and for that the 3090 slaps The reality is games are designed for consoles first and ported to PC I still can't tell the difference between Ray tracing on vs off and that's the main PC advantage
NVIDIA forces you to buy a 4000th gen card otherwise you wont be able to use dlss 3 I played a few games with dlss 2 and it sucks bad on a big monitor owning a 3090ti feels like ass
They mean graphic designers architects ML developers anybody who needs the extra RAM and cuda cores
There are more and more company start to use blender in cycles render GeForce card runs faster than quadro card because it uses cuda and quadro card uses OpenGL other mainstream render engine also works great with geforce card such as octane redshift Arnold game development also uses GeForce card some indie architect company uses GeForce card as well because it s better value compare to the quadro card rtx30 4090 is a great card for professional use large vram and killer performance
Can we stop fabricating product names to make an appeal to emotions It only makes things more confusing There will be cards for gamers who cannot afford 900 cards obviously
Gtx 1070 can comfortably run basically any game and is the cheapest option out there
Do chess players have friends
Competition always benifits the consumer But there will be people who buy nvidia always I think amd being clearly cheaper would help them gain more users Instead of being in a similar ball
Like always AMD will price their parts relative to Nvidia Cheaper sure but not by much Because they can The people that will not buy Nvidia have no other choice so AMD will leverage their consumers just like they always do The goddamn wafers in these GPUs only make up a small part of the actual cost of the unit both Green and Red team have been scamming us hard the last few years
It s a publicly traded company They value profits If it sells and they can increase the price they will Nvidia already set the bar so AMD knows they can increase prices I m willing to bet my left nut that AMD will increase prices as well
The crazy part of last gen is amd had better avilablity after a bit but the aib's basicaly price bumped their cards that were in stock to match nvidia aib's prices If we don't see that again or see amd direct with good stock they defintely could be in a spot to gain alot of sells
AMD aren't going to price competitively either these people are in for a rude awakening They'll just price slightly lower than NVIDIA's batshit pricing to reflect the lack of features and demand
It's not about caring about consumers It's about an opportunity for AMD to gain market share Because I can tell you they won't be selling many Gpus at 1900 euros
I ve been following tech for a long time longer than I d like to admit AMD recognized something back around the HD 4870 launch that they probably still operate under Significantly undercutting nVidia doesn t net them a significantly higher market share so now they just try to maximize profit off the sales they actually do get
Every corporation doesn t care about their customers None of them They re all the same Amd Nvidia Intel Google Apple Amazon CDPR It s all the same bullshit
The 6900 xt launched 500 under the MSRP of the 3090 which AMD was fully trying to compete with I can see it happening again
Ssshhhh you re going to spoil the My brand cares about me and my livelihood mentality most people have
They're probably thinking about first gen Ryzen and Threadripper which undercut Intel by a lot while offering almost the same performance or about Ryzen 3000 which beat Intel in price AND performance With RDNA 3 being chiplet based some think it'll happen again
People are rooting for competition because this is a monopoly and the price fixing is proof of this
What exactly are their margins I've asked a few times now if anyone has an idea on what a card actually costs to produce but haven't gotten an answer yet
Dropping their prices by that much would really piss off the people who ve bought one at the old price
Exactly Cost to manufacture has gone up for everyone too Chip prices are high I read TSMC has raised prices on them by 20
That's the currency devaluation part right there because before this year the sales tax was offset by it in the past
They've released a stronger GPU every year The difference is the enormous price hike for gpus in the same series Prices in the same series shouldn't go up much year after year The icentive to buy a new one is the fact that they've gotten better
The GPU is stronger because the tech is advancing and advancements in tech don t always mean continual exorbitant price increases Sure Nvidia did invest in further research and development but they recoup these costs from selling you a shiny new GPU that s better than the previous gen you may have bought too it doesn t mean they have to keep increasing their profit margins The iPhone 14 Pro for example is more advanced than the iPhone X but in the US is priced at the same 999 Many people will have bought the X 11 12 13 and now upgrading to the 14 The improvements Apple makes to their devices convinced consumers to keep upgrading Nvidia is trying to do the same marketing the sheer power of 40 series Except they expect you to pay a lot more than you did for the last gen even though that gen was a massive improvement from 20 series too Nvidia used to release new generation GPUs at reasonable MSRPs despite the exponential tech advancements Most software also remains the same price for the next major version despite the advancements and investment in R D The hope is that they recoup expenses and make a profit on creating those advancements by selling you a new upgraded version Same for GPUs I m sure Nvidia s manufacturing costs are up but it couldn t be enough to justify these crazy prices they clearly want to make 30 series more enticing and push more sales of their excessive inventory
at the end of the day Hitler just got the American government to invest heavily in German infrastructure what's wrong with that
R9 290 470 480 have entered the chat
You remember the 6800XT launch right Reference undercut the 3080 FE MSRP by 50 650 vs 700 and AIBs for both were basically in the same ballpark
Just because a bughatti costs millions of dollars doesn t mean you can t get a nice car for 100 grand the price is clearly way higher than it should be but it doesn t affect your ability to buy a reasonably priced product
no because the greedy ceos will survive devs won't and without new talent the industry stagnates
Brilliant games are at an all time high Simply stop looking at the big money games
This absolutely not true Gamers absolutely shit on game devs when there are small flaws with a game Not sure what you mean by games are more and more objectively and technically flawed Games are more and more complex and expensive to make but I don t see more bugs than in the past Can you give examples However in the past when you found a bug in a game you were laughing and trying to exploit it Nowadays when people find bugs they open Twitter and go batshit crazy
Doesn't mean another crash for different reasons can't occur
Yeah but the question I keep asking myself is why would people pay those prices when there really aren't that many good PC games coming out I hear about flip after flop and I've been playing pcgames since 1996
Yep and CUDA is a huge moat that neither Radeon nor Arc can cross right now
I started out on an atari ste in cubase with midi only using it to sequence keyboards and stuff when i was a kid I remember the days when people used to go nuts for soundblasters etc the first high end gpu i got back in the day was a tnt2 my friends had voodoo cards Fun times
Yes that s why all other consumer electronics have more than doubled in price in the last 3 years Oh wait
Plenty of corporations and suppliers want to do business w nvidia There is a reason why supply chains work so hard to get Apple and NVIDIA's business NVIDIA didn't lose the GPU contracts on the consoles they simply left that market since they are no interested in low margin contracts AMD had no choice and had to bite the bullet and take the low margin semi custom biz which was a PITA for them but needed the cash And it's a good thing since the semicustom contracts were one the few things that help them keep the lights on before Ryzen BTW I'm not making excuses for nvidia I'm explaining you how the real world works It's silly to develop emotional attachments to corporations and products like some of you do It's rather ill adjusted A gaming GPU is just a silly consumer good rather low on the scale of priorities necessities for and similarly none of you are entitled to a non public utility product

exactly many people bought a 3080ti or 3090's just to flex those same people now want to buy 4090 but complain its too expensive Someone who knows they need a 4090 has it pumping out money its not there to flex I can see many enthusiasts here complaining but no professionals who can make the 4090 pay for itself rent and even more
I promise you're not gonna regret it Hafe fun
4k 60 in minesweeper doesn't count
People are downvoting because they have lost their sense of reality since the pandemic shifted their lifestyles Top end cards like the 4090 have always been expensive and it is literally a fact Nvidia had cards that were marketed the same exact way be even more expensive in the past Now if you want to talk about the 4080 bullshit then you might have a point but this post here is specifically pointing out 4090 prices being too high which is insane and delusional at the same time
Am asking you What do you think Nvidia makes
No one cares about competition They just want the fastest nvidia cards for the lowest price People didn't care about amd until they were the fastest cpu or can't afford Intel People aren't even happy with amd drivers you think people would want to shell out top dollar to be intel's beta testers with their first video card They just want nvidia cards to lower prices
To be fair a 3080ti at 850 is pretty big drop from new I'm sure they will continue to fall but you have to remeber they started at 1400 for alot of cards But with the recent crypto crash you may see the prices continue to trend downwards to some degree
That s over priced but straight up ignoring Come on newegg was selling 3080 tis for hundreds of dollars more just a few months ago just because they aren t lowering it as much as they should doesn t mean they aren t lowering it at all
Not enough people to justify the investment of making the cards So they hang onto 30 and 40 series cards to keep prices up via artificial scarcity but how long do they need to sit on them for What happens if they have to sit on them for longer than they are top tier GPUs What if AMD Intel catch up within a year and Nvidia still has 80 of their stock still sitting in warehouses It's a bad business model They just spent a ton of money making a bunch of 30 series cards and now 40 series and that investment is just going to sit in warehouses so they can earn a tiny trickle of money from the few that can pay those prices How do they recoup the cost of the rest of the cards before they are not caught up to by other offerings from other companies that are cheaper I think it's just stupid EDIT The point is that it's an unsustainable business strategy It's not about caring it's about actually making your money back on your investment like investors expect
You re a bit late then 3090 s launched a bit ago mate
Bit late for that 3090 launch there
Bah I was there to buy GTX Titan the OG one GTX 780 generation for 999 back when that was massively more than any other card by then That was insane
More news is going to come out about this The power supplies aren't even out yet so the AIB are including the adapter to go from multiple 8pin to single 16 pin connector which is the new atx3 0 standard min power recommended spec for a 4090 is 1000w at least two 12v rails you can look up the max deliverable power per rail on for you own psu typically on their website if you're going to upgrade to 4090 I would strongly suggest you get a new ATX 3 0 psu rated 20 over the min spec this will contain that data pinout natively and will be plug and play
Yup but it's also the cost of just the materials and fabrication too mixed in as well One company might be able to squeeze out more performance with a cheaper to produce cooling solution than another company so each GPU's actual performance will vary depending on how it's tuned and how cool it can keep itself This is why each generation receives indepth performance rankings across synthetic benchmarks and popular games from YouTubers and tech media so we can all see how each AIB's offering stands against the rest performance wise and cost wise over a spread of scenarios
I hadn't really been paying attention to what's going on with the euro I just know it's dropping I guess I don't really understand international economics well enough why is the euro dropping in relation to the US dollar bad Is your buying power changing as a result We're seeing pretty heavy inflation over here ourselves
Today 1 Euro 0 97 USD I cannot recall when the USD had more value than the Euro edit just realized prices were in pounds not euro but still Strange times
These are Euro prices they already have a higher markup than the Australian markup via 20 VAT vs 10 tax The raw conversion from USD to AUD 10 tax is 2700 AUD but due to shipping and cooler costs you'd likely see prices start at 3000 AUD or just under that
I just checked the UK MSRP and its actually 1649 so that's the right price I thought it was 1499 my bad
minors don't have a lot of money
My allowance was like 4 week Birthday money would never cover that
My brother in Christ I fully expect the 4060 to be no less than 600 Nvidia has basically said that if you aren't willing to spend exorbitant amounts of cash buy last gen cards Although that isn't much of a proposition as inventory on those will run out sooner or later so effectively that means the average gamer will now HAVE to buy used People also say just to buy amd but if they think amd is not just gonna price match nvidia maybe knock off 50 100 at the high end at most they are deluding themselves Nvidia is just shifting the gpu market from a high volume industry to a low volume high profit margin one Its buy used or buy an Xbox And if things keep going this way an Xbox looks mighty tempting
How is that not their fault I wanted a 3070 I got on evga's waiting list I waited 7 months and got it at msrp There were definitely ways to get gpus at msrp for the patient And all that is irrelevant Gpus are a luxury item You literally don't need them When facing ridiculous pricing you can just walk away Thats what I would have done if evga didn't come through for me There are countless other things I could do besides gaming And you even had a 5700xt so you would have been able to game just fine
Sounds about right I gotta buy lettuce from countdown though so my paychecks spoken for
Because amd can't afford to in theory They got away with it because during the crypto boom people would buy literally anything at any price but now if you look at how much gpu prices have fallen below msrp especially for amd gpus they just can't afford to match nvidia and have their cards sell I don't think nvidia can afford to either tbh the current pricing is a mistake and i expect huge price cuts in just a few months after release No one will buy a 4080 12 gig aka a 4070 for 900 when a 6900xt can be had for 700 and is still dropping
Possibly because it's a good publicity and a good opportunity to take back a certain amount of marketshare especially if everyone's pretty confident no one's really going to buy these cards at these inflated prices anyway Like right now is a pretty good time to say Yeah Nvidia cards are the most powerful but would you maybe like to consider power per dollar and power per watt They can also still choose to price high of course I'm sure some buisness execs are hand wringing over exactly where to mark things
thank u its will be my first bike 1500 euro cheaper than a fucking gpu i remember the times when u could build a whole good pc for 1500
Unless you want to pay more then I d go for FE
Get one of the ASUS cards TUF for temps or Strix for performance
Yeah VR is definitely where the upgrades are most beneficial but I'm running a rift s and a 2070S so the only reason I would want a better GPU is if I buy a better PCVR but right now the pcvr market isn't great so I'm just gonna wait another year or two
You are not quitting eating for a GPU you are fasting is the fancy word for it
An addiction is considered an addiction when it negatively impacts your health relationships work life but you keep doing it Perhaps you should reconsider your gaming habit
Yeah thats probably a play id bet they are hoping to hold back supplies of 40 series so they can keep the price high to encourage the sale of old 30 series stocks
More like a bell curve p The days of easy gains are gone Fast cheap quality Pick any two
40 series might be more efficient in terms of perf watt if people frame rate limit youd probably never get your savings back if you undervolted the card ran like a 60hz lock on a 1080p game etc but i suppose it depends on how bad electricity bills get over the lifespan of the card if bills go up 5x it could have a huge impact even if you only play a couple of hours a night and a couple of weekends here and there Nobody can predict the future though
Or maybe we don't have much time for gaming but when we do we want the experience at 4K 120FPS on a big monitor
That's disgusting man And I've loved video games my entire life But when over 40 of your waking hours are video games even more of you minus bathroom and eating breaks That's a sickness and a real issue
I see Thanks for the explanation
Each state has its own tax rate Wouldn t work for a national ad Some states don t have sales tax Makes sense if you live here
Nah it's basically just that taxes are included in the list price including VAT It's 20 tax on 1650 Euro The prices are within 1 2 of parity between euro dollar
Is that before any taxes Because that's rough if so The pound is still holding solid exchange against the dollar iirc If it's a pre tax price it should be like 1475 pounds 13 tax brings it to 1679 pounds though so if tax is included they're basically all equal in price parity
thank u
True But equating a GPU to a watch is just ridiculous
Wrong lol I can double my money by the time I walk out the door
Eh At a certain point a GPU won't be able to run certain games These things won't run or last forever
I mean it wasn't specifically but the point was that the entire new lineup is currently prohibitively expensive even more so in Europe
i dont disagree but this is a post about the 4090
Why are people so fixated on the model numbers They re all arbitrary and have very often been inconsistent between generations Games that get developed now will target the cards that sell the most It s that simple Just buy the ones that you are happy on the price to performance ratios for I do concede the high prices and marketing are annoying because a lot more gamers will buy the expensive cards that they don t need because the lower and once haven t been announced at all
Nothing just random learning and experimenting
I stand corrected Valid point
4080 is a suckers tax Unfortunately
Not to mention just pirating a game for a demo Lmao I'm not even going to question the integrity of that But over the years I've learned having a massive library doesn't really matter if you're playing only a fraction of those games at a time
If you are playing hundreds of games you probably don't have a day job and more power too yah
Games are made for consoles first and optimized Then cobbled together to kinda run on PC's So much efficiency is lost
talking bs on reddit
You are conflating power with value A PS5 is 1 6th the cost of a PC and games are optimized with hardware level access
It s apples to oranges Having a powerful PC matters when you re chasing games to run at highest settings If you buy a console you get a library of games optimized and validated to run exactly a certain way on exactly that hardware be it 4x slower than a 4090 or 2x faster
You cant tell the difference get your eyes checked my friend D x200B There is easily a difference with both RT on and 4K res
I can't perceive an improvement over 1440p in gaming I guess that explains how you can say A PS5 looks just as good on a TV as a PC I mean I guess maybe you wouldn't be able to perceive a difference above 1440p if your monitor is 24 or something
Then they use a Quadro titan or the RTX 6000 lol RTx 6000 has 48gb of vram 18k cuda cores
Uh no
That is true XFX and powercolor had some models that were close to msrp like the xfx speedsters and powercolor fighters But the other card makers have some silly prices on AMD cards
100 It's true that nvidias prices are insane and this gives AMD an opportunity to slightly undercut them However people will gobble this up as AMD being pro consumer just because their prices aren't 'as' crazy but won't acknowledge the fact that they'll still be insanely overpriced PC Gaming is headed for a dark future
Somebody gets capitalism
Even rooting for AMD to grab the max market share they could get my big question is Do they partners even have enough production volume to do a feat like that or is better just sell the cards a bit cheaper than NVIDIA than having people complaining about paper launch because there isn t enough stock for customers From my understating GPUs are the same level of complexity or even more than CPUs and they can t just ramp up production by 20 with a switch see silicon shortage that we got 1 2 years ago
If they wanted to keep me as a customer they would have patched the drivers for gtav i lived with known issue artifacting with an amd 290x for 5 years They to this day havnt patched it Ill pay double for nvidia every time driver updates are same day or
Problem is they won't get any sales with insane prices People won't even be buying nvidia
AMD recognizes the people frothing in the mouth and clamouring at the bits for opportunity for market share if you undercut 11 1 1 only want AMD to make nVidia do price cuts so they can buy nVidia
So in a way it's the Nvidia fanboys who caused all this There are many many people who will not consider an AMD card even if it's significantly cheaper There are also people who want AMD to price lower so that Nvidia is forced to reduce prices thus allowing them to buy an Nvidia card AMD cannot win so just follows Nvidia's pricing based on performance tiers
Makes it easier to simplify the world eh
I have heard 60 but I'm not sure what the source on that number is so take it with a grain of salt
I think the glass is half full here honestly NVIDIA raised their prices 80 on the 70 series and 70 on the 80 series AMD is unlikely to do that They prob made these cards with the idea of selling a 7800 at 600 and a 7800 xt at 700 And they'll prob now charge 650 for a 7800 and 800 for a 7800 xt They'll take advantage of the situation most likely But they wont go 70 price hike like NVIDIA just did NVIDIA is jumping the shark here with these prices and we all know it
Prices in the same series shouldn t go up much year after year Would you be happy if they renamed 4080 to 4090 and 4090 to Titan
If you're claiming that the cost to produce a 4090 in 2022 is the same as the cost to produce a 3090 in 2020 I'd love to see some evidence
oh my god you are justifying a price imagine selling only buggati tier product and ignoring every other segment then ask them to buy older or used hard to justify that
Vampire survivors and Ion Fury are two of the best games ive played in a long time Ive had such a bad backlog ive not even got around to trying stuff like valheim yet either
Nah I'm not talking about funny bugs I'm talking about game breaking immersion shattering bugs that quickly become more annoying than they could ever be funny I'm talking about missing promised features Laughable excuses for AI Choices in a story that don't matter Terrible gunplay Grind artificially inflated to make you want to buy microtransactions in games that are full priced to begin with You can pull the 'gamers these days' card all you want but it just makes me think that you are the kinda gamer that is enabling these lazy ass companies to continue pushing drivel like modern Assassins Creed Ghost Recon Cyberpunk Battlefield V 2042 Halo Infinite Saints Row or the laundry list of other recent titles that are abject technical and narrative shitshows
100 The rub is if the underlying factors leading to the crash are fundamentally different then what makes it like the previous crash
The sole reason for CUDA's popularity is the exact same as x86's popularity no one wants to recompile the code
For sure I was lucky enough to get the EVGA 3080 from their queue system I will forever be grateful for them Wish this generation wasn't so jacked

Im just a hobbiest but I'm a VR nut so ill take any diminishing returns i can get within reason even an extra 10 fps makes a difference in VR for me its a value prop performance 2k card is a bit extreme though i can pay it its just i dont feel the need want to pay it Its like lusting for a ferrari when you already have a porsche Im lucky in that i kind of dont need the upgrade right now should new VR hardware release though say end of next year i might want more power to drive higher resolutions and framerates
People are downvoting because they have lost their sense of reality since the pandemic shifted their lifestyles In just five years Nvidia tripled the price of their flagship gaming GPU Flagship Nvidia gaming GPU prices 2016 600 GTX 1080 2017 700 GTX 1080 Ti 2018 1200 RTX 2080 Ti 2020 1500 RTX 3090 2021 2000 RTX 3090 Ti 2022 1600 RTX 4090 Bonus 2023 2500 4090 Ti
People didn't care about amd until they were the fastest cpu or can't afford Intel You mean over two decades ago
Not enough people to justify the investment of making the cards Would you bet your house on that You saw how happy the scalpers were in 2020 21 There were loads of posters here defending them too What happens if they have to sit on them for longer than they are top tier GPUs They won't they will sell plenty of them and make a tidy profit I think it's just stupid You underestimate the stupidity of people People will pay and they will justify it to themselves that they have no choice and Nvidia will laugh their heads off The way to win this is to buy only second hand older series cards and refuse to pay inflated prices for those cards But That Will Never Happen We had our chance in 2020 and we blew it
Or I consider it like any hobby Plenty of people drink spending 500 a month on going out drinking I choose to buy electronics If you re really that up tight about a little money maybe switch professions I mentor people to become software engineers all the time Truly financially freeing position
Yeah I'm gonna keep an eye on the post on here asti be honest I havnet updated sine 1080 cards lol and I'm Gonna buy the RTX 4090 been waiting forever for
This isn't the euro it's the pound
and are different is just used in the UK This is my opinion so take with a pinch of salt as I am very cynical atm Basically for the last 12 years we have had a government which has believed in trickle down economics where they believe giving the rich more money will eventually trickle down to the workers Except this trickle of money is actually just piss Less money has been going into infrastructure and into the friends of politicians pockets With the energy crisis the average household cannot afford luxury goods or services and basically they can't afford energy anymore Many jobs have not seen wage increases with inflation but providers of basic commodities have seen record high profits each year Energy costs have basically doubled and so have food costs yet my wage has stayed the same So now we have small medium businesses that cannot afford to stay open due to people not being able to buy anything outside of basic goods and upkeep costs for energy soaking up all their money High streets are basically dead Now the huge drop in value of the pound is because of recent changes in taxation announced by the new Government Which essentially is a small cut in taxes for the poorest and a big cut for the richest As well as a planned increase in corporation tax being scrapped energy prices being capped for consumers by borrowing billions instead of taxing the excess profits of energy price gouging meaning the average person will be repaying this in the future So now we are in huge amounts of debt the government is selling anything that isn't nailed to the floor to their friends and businesses that promise them a job after their political career is over So basically tax cuts funded by borrowing has fucked investor confidence so everyone's pulling out unless they have their hand in a politician's back pocket Edit so basically if I bought something in America in 2008 for 200 I would actually be spending 100 because it was close to 1 for 2 Now if I buy something in America for 200 I will basically be paying 200 We usually compare against the American dollar because it is the currency most commonly used on the global market But essentially importing goods is expensive af
is predicted to eventually pass below anyway after today's mini budget announcement
wait what That's insane I always remembered euros being slightly more then dollars
and you bought malts at the soda bar with your mates for a nickel right
Some people couldn't get them off a list though Their best shot was winning a newegg shuffle I was on waiting lists that never messaged me with stock And the 5700 xt was able to game fine but it couldn't handle vr So the vr headset that I bought would become a paperweight if I didn't upgrade the gpu Vr is the only thing that makes me want to upgrade my gpu even today I see little reason to upgrade for 1440p normal gaming These are all luxury items An xbox a ps5 a gaming pc
I actually really want to go FE much better looking card Hope we get it in aus newegg seems more expensive when I compared card to card just then
Who needs food when he has noobs to teabag LOL
Yea i think so Either way i myself would not spend so much for these cards now
I don't think you understand what a bell curve is unless you think hardware will loop back into getting worse with this comment makes no sense
Neglecting the most expensive component of gaming with a rig dumping upwards of 700 watts heat into your room the air conditioning bill
I know That guy has a problem
LMAO What a weird jealous petty outlook on it you have imagine giving that much of a shit what other people do with their spare time if it doesnt harm others Some people play with model trains dozens of hours a week who gives a shit The guy i know who streams is having the time of his life getting paid granted its not much to do his hobby I wish him all the best more fucking power to him i say
They're also not as drastic as EU if I understand right My uncle lives in Florida and I buy stuff online sometimes and send it to him so he can deliver it for cheaper for me Usually everything I buy costs me an extra 6
ah yea fair enough either way we can agree Its a bit on the high side ha
UK prices are always inclusive of tax unless they state otherwise as we have the same 20 rate across everything The reason why we re seeing such a big increase from last year is also due to the pound being so weak against the dollar compared to what it has been previously
Wut We have a 20 VAT rate here and all prices always include it unless otherwise stated The 1679 price already includes the VAT This isn't america
Run certain games fast Example A GTX 660 can still run modern DX12 games just not at a high resolution and it's a decade old
Nvlink 2080's
I don t think thats the case even Sony s games that have come to PC have better graphics and performance than the PS5 Consoles are the most economical hardware and they optimise games to run on there but not the best performance Just look at GTA V through the generations each generation you would have to repurchase it on console and then on PC
Welcome to the club lol
What PC You can buy new PC for 200 Is PS5 30 PC with about the same processing power will cost about the same Where's value in that Can you proof that games with identical graphical settings not Ultra on PC vs very low on console are performing at least much better on console not 4x better like you're implying Cause I've seen dozens of videos and articles and performance is either the same or consoles are only slightly faster
SpunkyDred is a terrible bot instigating arguments all over Reddit whenever someone uses the phrase apples to oranges I'm letting you know so that you can feel free to ignore the quip rather than feel provoked by a bot that isn't smart enough to argue back SpunkyDred and I are both bots I am trying to get them banned by pointing out their antagonizing behavior and poor bottiquette
apples to oranges But you can still compare them
I'm sure you're right but I grew up with 480i games on 4 3 TV's lol The jump in quality is diminishing after 1440p for me VR is another story
PC monitor at my desk is a 55 OLED
Nah work in Design Video Editing the 3080 3090 were very good options price wise for how much we were making Moving to AI soon and I'm seeing a lot of RTX 3090's in general too
Two 3090s w nvlink are cheaper and faster than one a6000 Heck two 3090s cost as much as an a5000 which is a 3080 with extra ECC RAM
Lol no you can't expect every 3d artist or video editor to be able to buy those
Everyone in my industry is using RTX cards Much better price to performance
I cant run like 3 4 games with a 1050 why can't a 1070 do the rest
I don't get this narrative that we think AMD is going to undercut because they care We think they will undercut because nobodies buying AMD for the same price as Nvidia That has always been the case They also have NOT shown they will price match the top end cards AMD's top end is at least 500 cheaper than Nvidia's right now
20 for frame interpolation That's your opinion personally I don't see myself using it I only use upscaling when I have to now otherwise it's off Now a version with no added benefits to input lag I'll pass
Do they partners even have enough production volume to do a feat like that They did it with Ryzen when they switched to the chiplet design The top end models of the 7000 series is supposed to be using a chiplet design as well
AMD has had significantly worse drivers since the ATI days They have gotten decent lately but they are still behind Nvidia I would love to simp for AMD GPUs like I do for AMD CPUs but not until AMD improves even further
Just read this great article over at Tom's discussing pricing Very interesting
Are you a paid shill
And then with the titan getting titan features and the 4080 12GB being the only 4080 and them having to come up with a justification for a 80 price jump from 3080 to 4080 Yes I would be happy actually
I don't think I would
I didn t say that my post literally says I m sure Nvidia s manufacturing costs are up but it couldn t be enough to justify these crazy prices
I m not justifying it I m saying why it doesn t matter Does Bugatti sell budget cars Besides it s not like this is the entire product line it s just a staggered launch
I actually loved the narrative in cyberpunk sure its a kind of cliche cyberpunk fiction story but i loved the atmosphere and tropes I feel like i was one of the few people who finished it within a week of release and basically had no bugs well a couple but no game breaking ones one or two mild graphical glitches So i had a great time Grew up liking philip k dick and loving similar stuff to the genre like shadowrun though so its my wheelhouse i can see why people who believed CDPRs hype about it being open world future gta would be super disappointed what they promised is not what we got
I think it's just the only other video game crash that ever happened so it's the only point of reference
You forgot the Titans in this mix If you are bringing in the latest XX90 series those are equivalent to Titans You are comparing non flagship GPUs to flagship GPUs and even forgetting older flagship GPUs Really bad logic here and not consistent at all
It wasn't until Ryzen made a dent did people jump ship Just like their GPUs people only bought them because they were cheaper I came from nothing but Radeon until the 1080 Not because I was a fan boy but it was all I can afford Ever since the first Pentium chips Intel had been at the top of the CPU world AMD was like generic cereal Everyone still wanted Intel with AMD I don't recall AMD being faster until Ryzen I've been building PCs since Pentium 60 and my first one was a 386 33mhz without a turbo button I've actually built a Cyrex computer before the p60
You're completely missing the part where today things are not like they were a year ago or two years ago People don't have as much money as they did before They couldn't buy a 2k GPU if they wanted to
The euro is also at an all time low
I didn't look close enough My question stands though Both are dropping relative to USD I'm curious to know what the affect of that is
Well fuck that does all sound pretty stupid Folks over here are all worried about how they're going to survive our ongoing inflation but it sounds like things are even more fucked for you
Woohoo I love conservative economic policies Brexit Kick out all the foreigners s
Yes so if someone couldn't get one at msrp they should've just skipped the 3000 gen or waited until prices normalized instead of voting with their wallets and telling nvidia its ok to charge 1200 for a 4080 Its what I would have done So yes its 100 their fault and the miners Fomo is dumb and not even remotely an excuse
Hey we made lots of money during high demand how can we keep making money oh lets double our prices
Charts have two axis Rate of improvement over time The rate of Innovation drops off over time not getting worse
Lmao
Shit if i had 6 hours spare i would play rocksmith 6 hours a day 6 hours guitar practice a day would be sick Steve Vai used to practice 12 hours a day Shit ive jammed in jam rooms with buddys for 10 hours in one session before
It's not petty To think a person shouldn't spend half their day playing video games or doing anything of the sorts unless it makes money 6 hours a day is nuts
In the Netherlands it's 9 for the minimal stuff and 21 for luxury items I say minimal and luxury but there's a bunch of things that have the high tax rate even tho you could argue not all clothes for example are a luxury item
Can I borrow your uncle once or twice a year D Just ordered something from US for about 200 as it was sold out in my country already limited edition collectible stuff The price here would have been 200 now I paid 300 because an extra 100 for shipping and VAT D
And when it's two three decades old The watch Is still a watch These things are not comparable
I also want 120fps 4k gaming
They also come out five years later lol If you want multi platform on day one there are going to be compromises More people own consoles That's where the is
Cant even buy a good power supply for 200 what are you on about
Uh oh bot drama
Lol I feel that Man getting old sucks I used to be all about tweaking my 3Dfx Voodoo card and getting the highest resolution CRT I could find These days I m more like why would I want to turn on anti aliasing The jaggies help me tell where the edges are And why are all the fonts so small
If you can't perceive a difference between 1440p and 55 then you might want to consider seeing an optometrist
Super bummed 4090 don't have NVlink but I really don't need that much Vram yet 3090 is a killer deal now for the peeps who need it
Big businesses will Freelancers hobbyists are of course going to go the cheaper option but big studios businesses will equip their offices with the RTx 6000 Either 1 because they get a deal with Nvidia and get the cost reduced or two they pay out of pocket A 3090 ti still works quite great but some applications require that extra vram and some may see a significant difference in render times with the extra 8k cuda cores
Because games you play is not the same as games that other people want to play
I just love how every comment in this thread has some bitter cynical assumption at its core
Why would AMD be the one undercutting All AMD does is design the GPU chip and offers support guidelines AMD pays a chip fabricator to produce the chip and then AMD sells the chips to businesses that make the graphics cards That is as far as AMD is involved The chip fabricator wants their money The card manufacturers want their share The retailers want a cut as well
I'm on a rx 6800 and I play all my games no issue Drivers are fine for me I like NVIDIA cards also but I like to go for the best value I was going to go 3070 had one on pre order but the 8 gb turned me off because I didnt know if it would be a limiting factor in vr
Drivers are no longer an issue If you want to move to Linux like I'm going to the drivers are just better than Nvidias Games target AMD hardware first because that's what consoles use
9700Pro X1800XT HD2900XT HD4790 There was always some bug or some issue that needed fixing I switched gtx770 980 1080ti and the grass has been greener here I game on an AMD 5900X CPU and upgraded to Windows 11 on release I had to wait half a year for a BIOS update to fix the random stuttering due to fTPM I'm sorry but I like how Nvidia is with game ready drivers and unless AMD cards are significantly cheaper I will not be interested
Yeah I don't expect Nvidia has as much room to lower prices as some think Ada is super expensive to make I really wonder what the low and mid end are going to look like At least their power design will be much simpler TSMC saying their old nodes will no longer get cheaper really stings
I'm an AI actually trained on the new 4090
also there are never only two car companies in the world kekw
The Tis were only ever so slightly cut down versions of the Titans If you didn't need the double precision compute the Tis were like 300 cheaper for basically the same performance
Nope AMD was faster than Intel over 20 years ago The Athlon beat the Pentium 3 to 1 GHz and outperformed it it wasn t just a higher clock frequency it was faster in real world workloads
I want to be 100 wrong but we the people are really really stupid so I'm not hopeful Remind me of this conversation in a year and if you're right then I'll quite happily buy you a drink
For those of us renting it's even worse The average rent for a 1 bed flat has gone up over 25 this year in London outside of London some areas have gone up by more or less depending on the area but imagine having a 3 pay rise while energy is up over 100 rent 25 and food 5 15 I'm lucky in that I've had a promotion with a near 25 pay rise but I don't actually have any more disposable money than I did last year
Sadly yep we have 2 more years of this government If my 1080ti dies I might actually have to go out and start protesting
If they needed a card they needed a card Not much they can do If they were just upgrading just to upgrade then yeah that'd be dumb
Ah so you mean the rate of growth starts strong but over time it slows down until it reaches a low but sustainable equilibrium
Look im sorry that might have been rude you seem like you might be a good dude i just took umbrage with it as gaming to me as always seemed a pretty benign hobby I personally dont think somebody playing 3 4 hours a night after work and then bingeing at weekend for 10 hours a day is a serious problem relative to all the other shit wrong in the world and that averages out 5 hours a day every day if they are having fun and nobody close to them is suffering because they are neglecting their responsibilities its imo not an issue at all 16 17 hours a day every day and neglecting personal hygiene relationships etc probably is a real problem you would be absolutely right in that regard I wish i had the free time to play games 6 hours a day i dont i have other stuff to do and responsibilities but if i did i honestly easily could put 3 or 4 in rocksmith every day for a year Rocksmith is my thing because i play bass and guitar and have done for 20 years but somebody else might get enjoyment from playing elden ring 5 hours a day for 6 months who the hell am i to say otherwise Its a weird take to call somebodies hobby like gaming that they do disgusting on a gaming aligned subreddit when its pretty benign as a hobby in the grand scheme of things Some people get to older ages like 30's and 40's and 50's and life settles down a bit and they find they have more free time i dont have a mortgage anymore i dont need to work full time only 3 4 or 1 2 as much as i once did because my bills are low and my pay covers it and then some so i have a ton of free time spare i could easily put 3 hours a night in and a good 6 or 7 hours on weekends in but ive been there ive had to work 12 hours a night 6 days a week ive done two degrees ive worked 10pm 6pm then slept about 6 hours then gone and studied then had to rush and get something to eat then try get across town to work by 8 9pm I just think your take was a little judgemental perhaps based on your own circumstances Im not sure what you do for a living but it sounds like you dont have as much free time as you would like or perhaps you do and you dont spend it gaming but if you spend it doing something else you enjoy thats good keep doing it I love to mountain bike so i like to spend a lot of time outdoors also i ride about a 100 miles a week did like 15 miles yesterday
21 VAT is pretty much harmonized all over EU as the union not Europe for this kind of goods You have a 1 2 up or down here and there but mostly it is
Uncle borrowing tax is 50
You said 5 A 1080ti is 6 years old and look how well that card still holds up
Currently possible But do you want the latest games 120fps 4k RT on Ultra No DLSS Because the 40 series won't hit that And if we start adding DLSS say 3 0 drop the settings to high etc then a lesser card will do
It just doesn t make sense to buy a console like a PS5 or Xbox anymore you are better off buying building a PC and a Nintendo Switch only for their first party titles everything else on PC perhaps a Steam Deck if you want to play remotely Console games are ridiculously expensive you save so much money using Steam or other sites and the games don t have issues of support once the next console comes out although admittedly from the PS4 XBONE that is less of an issue Also I m quite patient loads more titles are coming now that Sony sees that it s good business
WTF are you even talking about 500W Thermaltake and EVGA PSUs are 35 50 on Newegg That's plenty of power for say RTX 2070
Lol truth Fonts at 4k is hard life
Noted
When did I say that you have to run the games at 4k max settings You are a gamer and want to play all games regardless of quality not a spoiled brat who NEEDS to play 4k max settings 144fps
There is nothing bitter or cynical about it AMD is a company looking to maximize profit They will do exactly that Were you around for the K8 days AMD was destroying Intel go have a look at their flagship CPU prices back then Hell look at the price increases on the 5000 series Ryzen No buddy it's not cynical or bitter to expect AMD to do what any company does
You can always tell when someone gives up on reasoned discourse in an internet argument kekw is a great marker of that
This person is saying flagship GPU prices have tripled in 5 years by comparing a 1080 to 3090 ti 4090 lol Come on now
I stand corrected I skipped the P3 era and went from PII to P4 then C2D
Wouldn't both technically be correct then One is logarithmic and one is linier I could be wrong good chance I am haha
DLSS 3 adds latency by injecting fake frames between the real ones I don't need everything to be perfect but I want the best card I can get for a price I can afford If I buy a lesser card now I'll want to upgrade it sooner 4090 is much better than 3090ti even ignoring Nvidia's marketing lies
You said the GTX 1070 could comfortably run any game which is demonstrably false If you happen to have a Reverb G2 VR Headset there are hundreds of games you couldn't play with a 1070 It might be a newsflash for you but people generally think progress new generation means that they can look forward to better performance at a cheaper price
Cynicism is defined as an inclination to believe that people are motivated purely by self interest It being a company aside your statement is fully cynical
Eh true A bit on the nitpicky side though The titan was really just a quadro in sheeps clothing though
A bell curve isn't a graph it's a statistical distribution module It has more in common with an excel sheet than it does a Graph with vectors That's why you correcting the guy's first comment makes no sense If you do mean the general shape and also that it only measures acceleration and and not speed then maybe But in that case it would a shifted non repeating Sine Graph But as you can see I have to make a lot of changes and assumptions to make your initial comment make sense
I know Well current gen cards can do 4k at 120 then
If you own a VR headset then you have no right to complain about the prices lmao Its not my fault you are playing VR games that require much more power than non vr games Maybe just maybe don't use the VR headset and you'll be able to play any game And 90 of those VR games also have non VR option And from quick Google searches the VR headset you mentioned costs up to the price of the RTX 4080 it self so it was your decision to not be able to play any game you want for cheap
My statement is fact
How is it nitpicky when they are comparing GPUs that aren't even in the same league It's an apples to oranges comparison
The four horsemen of Newegg Voided orders Pending charges Partial refunds Tax frauds Bonus Delayed shipping
Don t ever use Newegg ever again They re actually the fucking worst
People would be much happier if they stopped caring about Newegg Newegg certianly stopped caring about you a long time ago If I were in the market for a card I'd be watching best buy and Amazon
I quit doing business with NewEgg a LONG time ago They went from Awesome to No Thanks years ago
Oh boy GN Tech Jesus is going to have a hell of a time s 20 t nI ALEQ 6rSG m be9LCdQ following up the previous Newegg fiasco I am so glad I avoided their bait but damn I hope they rectify things ASAP for the OP thumbs up Edit Update I tweeted s 20 t EtWSjyr8 FJXxuOgApExmg this thread at GN and hopefully it gets their attention and Newegg's and assists anyone screwed in similar fashion today by Newegg I implore any and everyone to either retweet or tweet at Newegg and media publications GN I really hate this steady stream of anti consumer f ery by the industry these past weeks
New egg used to be good many years ago when they first came out but haven't been since those early days Not sure when the changed happened but they need to be avoided Just go to Microcenter
The void I understand completely people are rushing to purchase them mistakes happen The hold for a pending charge I understand because that's the way banking works What I don't understand is why I am now blocked for 48 hours from buying a graphics card Another set of cards dropped and I got it in my cart but was refected with a message saying I had already purchased one and had met my quota That's just an insult never going to find one of these face with tears of joy
Yeah my strix got voided too today I feel your pain
One of the few reasons why I don t use Newegg unless it s really necessary Newegg actually USED to be the place to buy PC components and computer parts back in the day Now it s just not a trustworthy site anymore
At this point I'll sooner buy from Amazon than newegg Their reputation has tanked over the last few years and the way they've handled GPU shortages has been abhorrent
All this does is prove to me that it was all just lip service from Newegg corporate when Gamers Nexus did that interview meet with them a while back
Yea that's some bullshit I would be really upset too about that I feel like the card should never be charged until the physical barcode for the GPU is scanned and is now in process of being packaged for you
That's not very customer first There's your mistake They really don't care
That's some bullshit they pulled
How is newegg still alive
Screw Newegg They have the worst business decisions that I have ever seen Only reason they still shop Newegg because of computer parts and graphics cards if other retailers don t have it I hate how they do bundles that don t make sense and not recommended compatible to each other Anti consumer af
I hate this process If it's in your checkout it should be locked for 5 min so it doesn't get taken by bots
Absolutely unacceptable coming from a retailer Newegg should know better than this
Obviously that sucks but these are the risks you take when dealing with one of the scummiest companies out there Learn the lesson and don't use Newegg ever again
These retailers are just shit No excuses
Newegg is absolutely trash now It's pathetic Gamers Nexus is doing yet ANOTHER video on them
Last time I used Newegg was like 2015
Well your first mistake was ordering from Newegg
Chargeback Chargeback Chargeback u Cheekermonkey
Newegg is complete trash Completely moved all our business to purchasing from other resellers Ever since they got bought out it's been garbage What do you expect if the company that bought them out has a track record of ruining good companies
This is so damn annoying bro I can feel your rage lol Don t let it stress you too much though You ll get one as soon as this dumb shit is fixed
that doesn't seem customer first Uh excuse me Are you living in a dream Companies don't care about you They care about money
You would think that their counter function could be changed to only look at completed orders or in progress Seems really short sighted on their implementation
Newegg used to be the best back when I was in high school It's so sad how far they've fallen
blocked me from buying a video card for 48 hours because I've hit my quota Sounds like something Newegg would do
Yeah fuck newegg for this
Happened to me as well It wasn't a new card but it was a discounted item I really wanted it as it was heavily discounted so I managed to use another card with either account to buy it It really screwed my house economy from having a lot of money on hold on my main card A really shitty
I mean as long as people gonna use that shitty company it s not gonna stop
Newegg is simply terrible I purchased an ssd on there about a year ago and my order got canceled with no warning or reason why I contacted support and they said it was canceled because of an inventory mistake but that it is now back in stock at the same price They then linked me the item which supposedly is in stock and their link brings me to the listing but out of stock and 20 more expensive I try to explain that and they didn t believe understand me Not to mention I used a coupon code for the first order that was single use only and is now invalid I haven t visited Newegg since
These 4090's are routinely stocked at my local Microcenter Do you have one nearby you could just go to
Yeah man I don t fuck with new egg Micro center has treated me right and the employees at the mayfield heights location are awesome Helped my kid and I out a few times
NEWEgg same old habits
Oh boy I'm amazed the 4090 I ordered from Newegg arrived with no issues although the box was slightly damaged
Honestly it s about time for a class action I see Newegg swindling ppl left and right
Totally uncool to put a hold on you from buying two freaking days even though your purchase was voided and they know it I got luck today and snagged a Gigabyte 4090 OC from Newegg but before this second attempt I had an Asus 4090 Strix checked out payment processing then cancelled due to stock Hang in there you get your card and so far us normal gamers are getting stock after a week with the POS scalpers grabbing everything Believe me scalpers see people are still able get at MSRP and their sorry azz will have to sale at MSRP too
As much as everyone hates Amazon they have always had good customer service in my experience
Fuck newegg I got a card for MSRP from Bestbuy for 1317 pre tax Stacking bestbuy 10 off 5 back in rewards 50 back in rewards email promo
Wonder how many bots they ve informed of this policy
Why do people keep shopping here How many more times do people have to prove to each other that newegg is complete shit
Newegg used to be the best back in the day but nowadays they are awful My friend bought a new 3060ti recently and received a dusty rx570 in the box Newegg initially denied his RMA and then gave him the run around and he didn't get his 500 back until over a month later after tweeting at them contacting several times all while having to record the conversations which he ended up having to use later as proof of things that were said They tried to screw him over and it wasn't until it got traction on Twitter that they started to respond favorably Add to that the one user who got weights in his 4090 box instead of the card and all of the crap Gamers Nexus went over last year I will never buy from Newegg again
Everyone knows what Newegg is all about since Gamers Nexus did their story If you still chose to give them money that s kind of on you NewEgg Scammed Us Confronting NewEgg Face to Face
I refuse to buy anything from that company They used to be so awesome before they were sold
Newegg is shit
Man you need a microcenter Ours has a whole shelf of them
Newegg banned my IP on launch day 5 minutes after the cards went live stating that I was botting All I was doing was hitting refresh every 20 30 seconds for the 15 mins before they went live Cost me getting a card that day I wanted the igabyte AIO and they were the only US retailer with them
I caved and bought some RAM from newegg Dead on arrival Shit stock shit services
Wondering why anyone uses NewEgg anymore after all the bullshit that was uncovered earlier this year by GamersNexus You re playing with fire You get burned
Newegg can eat a horses ass
This is why I NEVERRR order from Newegg and always Amazon
I ve seen so many of these posts about Newegg screwing up peoples 4090 orders Makes me feel super lucky that I was able to buy a 4090 from Newegg and receive an actual 4090 from Newegg all within a 6 day period Geez I feel for you guys that got boned by them pleading face hopefully it works out
Newegg is awful During prime day sales a few months ago I excitedly found a competing sale for a kit of hue color ambiance bulbs 4 bridge on sale on Newegg for 136 or thereabout a great price I bought 2 kits What I received was not what they sold me The deal they were selling corrected page after I kept yelling at them to give me my money back because they scammed me Item N82E16881609148 The warehouse responded to my email saying I received the correct items but they would be glad to refund me They sent 4 individual hue color ambiance bulbs and 2 individual bridges I bought 2 kits the kits come as a unit in a big box not separate retail boxes So if what they sent was correct why did they then change the item page to white bulbs The price of the kit was 136 on sale but 2 white hue bulbs and a bridge is like 90 MSRP The 136 is however basically the cost of 2 hue color ambiance bulbs and a bridge A scam through and through The Newegg sub has a single mod Newegg themselves and they deleted my thread there about the issue entirely I'm glad I archived the links so I have the receipts Fuck Newegg
yeah dont use newegg
Don't use Newegg The desperation for the new card isn't worth it
Probably dodged a couple of phonebooks or metal weights
Newegg fucking sucks they stole my RAM RMA claiming that an empty envelope was received and when I went to contact them they blocked my account so I couldn't even log in I've heard that people are receiving Graphics Card boxed with metal weights inside them and then finding their accounts suspended when trying to get money back What the hell is going on at Newegg
Newegg was acquired and went public last year In my opinion going public almost always means that a good company is going to turn into hot garbage Newegg turned to hot garbage long before now but it seems they were having trouble meeting the NASDAQ requirements to go public so perhaps they were doing whatever they deemed necessary to get the money to make that happen
4090s are being restocked within 48 hours Wow Virtually no restock since the tiny amount at launch here in the UK
Tag important people at newegg about this on Twitter I did that with shipping issues on my 1080ti and got an extra one for free
I think and please change my mind but I really think we are coming back to the era of going to physical stores again if this random marks ups and prices gouging in the online world is not resolved than I think we all are going to choose what s best for us
Once Newegg got bought out by the Chinese it fell to shambles I used to recommend it to everyone but now I tell everyone to avoid it
Why do people support does outrageous prices
That's when you call your credit card company and dispute it Send them the chat and they will take your side A They're just one more craptastic supplier They used to be
Let's all say it together DON'T ORDER FROM NEWEGG They are now a lost cause and if you order from any vendor that isn't Newegg proper God help you
Just to clarify have you purchased a card already No one has asked that question
It doesn't seem customer first because it's not
Why use Newegg in the first place They re are known to do this and many other bad service
See your issue is that you bought from Newegg
When will everyone learn that newegg is a pile of shit Everything Ive bought on there was fucking junk
Newegg put a 1000 hold on my credit card after I spent 300 with them and they said it s to ensure the funds clear
I built a new pc 2 weeks ago thank god I didn t buy shit from newegg but now it s time to delete their app
I would never buy something that expensive online i rather go microcenter
wow this shop is a joke exploding head
Newegg hasn t been customer first for well over a decade I hate seeing what they ve become
Ha Customer first silly
Best Buy and Amazon Newegg has ruined their once great reputation
Why do people still use this shit show of a retailer
Newegg is a bunch of slimy fucks with awful service I've had 2 bad experiences with them over the last few years I refuse to give them any more money
Newegg being fucking cringe again sorry bro
They have some really crappy policies I got denied a 2nd CPU in a sale they canceled the order even though I waited their stupid 48 hours Turn out their 48 hours doesn't start from your order time either but when they finish processing on their end and send the finial invoice shipped invoice It's better to avoid them now if you can and its a shame when they used to be the best
Been a looong time since Newegg was customer first
Yeah I stay away from Newegg like a cancer
Avoid newegg if you can I bought a case which clearly showed RGB fans in the pics and in the listing When I got the case it was just normal fans I contacted support and the first thing they said was to check with the manufacturer for a case they sold and took money from me I said I have the screenshot to prove it but they simply asked me to check with the manufacturer and said is there anything else we can help you with I live in one of those states that does not have a microcenter and the Frys store we had closed before the pandemic After his experience I only use Newegg if there is absolutely no other option I would be safe with a private seller at this point than using a company like Newegg
Someone call gamersnexus
I had the exact same experience when the i7 10900k dropped They charged me and canceled a day later while holding my cash I had set aside for the purchase hostage for a week I haven't spent a dime there since and NEVER will again Don't charge me if you don't have the product I am paying for
How s TigerDirect these days
Fuck Newegg I had to rma a board that wasn t working properly would power off when trying to resume from sleep Chose advanced rma to get a new one sent asap Then they charged me for the first one saying I had bent the socket pins which is a damn lie They are scammers in my opinion
I bought most of my stuff from newegg but I think in the future I ll avoid them
It's such a shame to see how far Newegg has slid It feels like watching the downfall of Fry's all over again
The hold on your card is on the credit card issuer not new egg
i don't understand why anyone uses newegg anymore they are shit
Newegg has gone to shit over the last few years And they dropped off a cliff face once the 30 series launched
Omg I am never buying anything from Newegg again
Newegg just plain sucks today Sad
Customer first Newegg lol are you a shareholder sir
Seems like you're not the only one facing newegg's crap service I stumbled upon this on gamer's nexus' channel i hope you guys can shine some light on the crap newegg is trying to pull
I got mine from CLX both for 3080 and 4090 both on launch day Newegg fucked me and did the same thing you're showing each time Never shopping with them again
I have literally never heard a single good thing about Newegg Every time anyone says or posts anything about them anywhere it's some colossally douchey move or mistake that they made Clearly they were good at one point or people wouldn't still be buying from them but come on surely people know by now right
Have a look on eBay The one you were to buy is probably on there courtesy of a scalper Here we go again
This is why I'm glad a Microcenter is within 30 minutes of me
Same thing happened to me except I wasn't charged at my bank yet I had purchased a asus tuff oc and right after I got an email they voided it Luckily I got a nvidia founders the next day as I was in the drawing for Priority access and picked it up from best buy yesterday
Newegg is the worst They don't give a shit about customers They blocked me for no reason lmao Now they block all everything relating to my name address and phone if any of it matches Why because I had issue with apple pay once and they killed my account of past 10 years They told me to sign up with another email and each order i did was canceled and my new account locked lmao I asked my wife to open one to order the new X670e board since they were the only ones with stock She did do it and got one But I don't order from them anymore
skullscam trumpet egg
me and my homies all hate newegg they're like the
Ahh seems like the perfect amount of time for the card to go on sale else where screw you over and keep your money hostage with newegg as your only choice to get a card right before they increase the price on the next batch of csrds they get in stock Because we all know 5 to 7 days every other store will damn near be out so they knee in advance what they were doing creating zombie customers
This is why I don t use newegg their whole operation is dodgy af I hope you get your whole situation sorted friend
Newegg pulled something like this to me in 2020 They will ban you account for the smallest reason and lock you out of it forever I don t buy from them anymore I literally can t I can t even make a new account without making a burner email just for newegg It s insane
I tell people don't ever use Newegg they used to be cool but ever since they were bought out by fucking China store DO NOT BUY FROM NEWEGG
I don t understand why people still shop on Newegg
When I buy a GPU I m going in store to Canada Computers and picking one up with my own two hands Not dealing with Neweggs bullshit
Newegg went seriously downhill and it did so FAST I've had similar issues and am still waiting on a refund from over a week ago
Its also not true I purchased a Strix 4090 from them this morning had second thoughts and canceled Then 20 min later bought 4090 tuf and it already shipped
The number one rule when shopping at newegg is to not shop at newegg
Same exact thing happened to me today Never using new egg again
Fuck newegg
Who TF uses Newegg still T you will
Make a new account if that is an option and can bypass the 2 day waiting time
Strong oh no
Clicked this post and saw Newegg instantly understood what the problem is You tried to shop at Newegg
Shitegg
god I'm so fuckin glad I have Canada computers instead of this shit
Newegg really out here robbing people
Why would you use newegg To buy a basketball and a garden hose with your GPU
Everything fine here in Europe Just snagged the aorus master yesterday D
Those cock suckers took almost 6k from me I thought I had one card email said I did Then 5 min later said it was out of stock and I'd get money back within 7 days Tried for a 2nd and 3rd card Same shit Cleaned out of fucking savings account Got to make sure their sponsored steamers and scalpers get theirs first
I mean you did ask for it by using Newegg
Fuck New Egg I ve had better customer service from scalpers
Still don't get how there is a rush on these cards Again I standard it's even 't let me start about 3080 just for gaming purposes But
Well stop buying from this shit company
New egg is evolving but backwards
If you order from NewEgg stock it's not horrible Stay away from their partners that usually ship from China
I ll never use Newegg again after I left a 4 star review for an item and the seller began harassing me to change it
This is one of those Computer says no situations isn't it You can be absolutely in the right but there's literally nothing that can be done because the computer system is unable to deal with this situation
Newegg went to shit around 2013 I stopped using them years ago Which is a real shame they were the best around for a time
New egg is trash I stopped supporting them a long time ago
I feel your pain I will never buy anything again from Newegg By far one of the worst online vendors for electronics
As sucky as it is that my 4090 was handled by Zotac through Newegg Marketplace I'm thinking that fact will mean I dodged one hell of a bullet here Fingers crossed for Monday
I knew they had terrible customer service but this is next level
Why are people still surprised that NewEgg is total garbage We all knew it since probably 2002 when theyd send you a dead component make the RMA a hassle make you pay for return shipping and pay for shipping of the replacement meaning you paid for shipping 3 times and waiting weeks if not months to get a working item you already paid for TigerDirect has always been better Now MicroCenter is my goto Never ever Newegg
FUCK NEWEGG ALL MY FRIENDS FUCKIN HATE NEWEGG
Newegg is pure cancer it's absolute trash tier website The only goal of all newegg employees is to scam people 24 7 as much as possible Never ever go on that website Never Don't do it Don't harm yourself
I'm still more in shock of the GPU prices 1 900 I paid 600 for my GTX1080ti They are 3x as expensive now This is nuts
Newegg hatrick congratulations
Ordering anything on Newegg is like pulling an infected hangnail while digging a hot pin under the rest of the nail and smashing your hand inside of a hydraulic press Seriously id sooner order from a scalper miner than newegg nauseated facenauseated facenauseated facenauseated facenauseated facenauseated facenauseated faceface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomitingface vomiting
2nd or 3rd time seeing a complaint about newegg Moral of the story dont buy from newegg at least the 4090
This is sad I thought we were passed this insane GPU fiasco now the crypto mining is nerfed SMH I see why Nivida priced this card so high Looks like there are folks out there still driving up these GPU costs
I posted this a couple days ago but I thought this story would be something relatable here My only problem with Newegg was years ago I purchased a NUC and some ram Next day I get an email that they actually didn't have the NUC in stock due to an inventory problem so they refunded my purchase of the NUC I got another email though stating they shipped the RAM I get in most cases this is probably the preferred way to do it but when your return policy requires me to ship back a package at my own expense you should really verify the order with the person before sending out the rest of the items They eventually gave me a discount on a higher end model so I didn't have to ship back the RAM but I had to deal with customer support for that
Why are people still using Newegg They havent been good since 2014 They sold me what was supposed to be a brand new Corsair AIO and it was clearly used and open the fins on the cooler were terrible bent out of shape and nearly destroyed Newegg refused to refund me on the return because they thought I put an older cooler back in the box and kept the new one I was out 140 and I had a cooler that looked like a child got a hold of it I never used them again after that
I had several tabs open using f5 to try to get a card got a few in the cart but missed the checkout Then they IP blocked me for 24 hours So you DON'T want my business huh What a joke
Incompetent as usual I see Shitty ass Newegg does not surprise me anymore
I used to go through NewEgg all the time Keep seeing more and more stories about them fucking over their customers Don't think I'll be purchasing from them again
Why does this surprise you exactly Lol
I recall there was a time newegg was not this bad
First mistake was trying to buy on Newegg these days That sucks hope you can get your card soon enough
This is why u only buy from Amazon and Best Buy Newegg needs to die and become bankrupt
Newegg used to be great back in the day but they are a shell of themselves I d honestly never use Newegg again
Newegg is nothing but a scam should have went through Amazon
Newegg used to be great Now they are trash and just the next company to go under
They dropped a bunch today and a few yesterday I was able to snag a Strix combo somehow today You ll get one man I know it sucks waiting though
definitely not cash money
Agent has left chat
The ones I ve seen come up today on Newegg were only sold in a bundle with a PSU Pretty shitty of them imho I already have a 1200w psu I don t need your random 800 ish watt rando psu you have to many of
lmfao owned don't buy from newegg
Suckers for dropping 1 5k on a gfx
That sounds like an interest free 7 day loan for Newegg
Shouldnt be paying 1600 for a gpu that is universally hated by the pc community right now Im just saying
time to dispute this charge with the bank
Well it's good that you are holding off on buying a new GPU since these new ones are rrrrright around the corner
I mean yeah it's shitty but it's Newegg They've gone to absolute garbage tier after they were bought out years ago and their 3rd party market is worse then Amazon's People keep using them though so they have no incentive to change You might be able to contact your CC company and do something about it there Not sure if you can chargeback pending charges but the CC companies might actually might get Newegg to change if there are enough problems
Whales gonna whale
That's what you get for supporting Nvidia's bullshit pricing Jk Kinda
Stopped buying from New Egg years ago
So wait did you already have one and are buying more to scalp
Lol why would you buy a video card from a scalping company
Why are you rubes buying online The pandemic is over Go to a brick and mortar store and buy the card on the spot Open the box in front of the cashier and inspect the goods before leaving Only use online shopping for Chinesium junk and ill fitting cheap clothing
Being lucky to spend 1600 2000 for a graphics card I think we have reached late state capitalism finally
1900 for a
Oh come on bud Don t be the guy that says customer first Yes I m on your side and Newegg is terrible at times but don t be that guy
You all calm down and take a breath Let the hype go away for a bit The ATX 3 PSU s required for this card s full safety without involving any adapter won t even release before Christmas meanwhile you simply take a very little risk to put your house on fire AMD is releasing their new GPU s mid November that simple fact is worth a wait and see Meanwhile if no one buy 4090 cards the casual scalpers will be scared and use the 14 days legal delay to send back what they stole The stocks might then be in less stress with all these considerations And we might even see a price drop if AMD hits hard Just wait I m waiting January at least There is no need to rush at all Only scalpers and NVidia benefits from that behavior and that s not what we want right
Don't buy a 4090 Just don't Teach them that we're not going to mindlessly throw cash away
Divine intervention from wasting 2 grand
Wow people really are losing their shit over a mild inconvenience huh I'd hate to see this sub's reaction to something actually bad happening
Guys Newegg is still dropping 4090's now Get 'nowinstock download to your cell for texts alerts or you can watch from the webpage
dude its 48 hours calm down
Good I mean it sucks that your order was voided but preventing people from purchasing several when most are still struggling to get one sounds like a great plan to me
If you're spending 1900 on a video card having that charge on your CC for 5 to 7 days shouldn't bother you lol The crazy rush to buy something so insanely overpriced is peak consumerism
Neweggs the worst but so is Amazon in many ways where are you people buying your parts
Customer first you're such a joker Did the rep get a good laugh you cut the chat log too soon
People still use Newegg
sounds about right This makes me feel slightly less bad i got a newegg credit card maxed it out at 2000 in turn they upped the limit to and years later when getting a house and having kids and yadda yadda i settled for cents on the dollar lol
Garbage
OP any update via Newegg
Dude thinking he's lucky to snag an overprice GPU top kek
Newegg really is the worst A few months ago they shipped my 3080 in a box with no packing and the box was OPENED by the time it was delivered
I don t even know why people still use Newegg
Sad cause they re the only ones selling the card I want The Arous Master
isnt that illegal
Solution Stop buying from Newegg
I'm confused did you actually order a 4090 before this
Another bonus Shipping the wrong product in the packaging of the original product aka not checking if returned products are in a sellable state
Don't forget credit card number skimming theft A few years ago I used a credit card that had been dormant for at least six months Made just a single purchase on Newegg and nowhere else Boom within a day it got hit with several fraudulent charges
Another other bonus Not shipping products at all
Oh how the mighty have fallen I remember back in like 2006 they messed up my order and sent the wrong CPU Not only did they cross ship they gave me a store credit and the rep sent me a Newegg tshirt
In hindsight I'm now glad my bank triggered suspicious activity and blocked the order I placed day one from Newegg I was pissed when it happened but I managed to find the same card from another retailer shortly after
I agree I moved like 15 minutes out of town about a year ago had to upgrade parts of my computer for work partly so my business could start work on optimizations to our software on DDR5 RAM so it was a pain to get it Newegg was the first to finally to have RAM that I was able to buy But they charged an like 90 for shipping And it is like with that much for shipping I assumed that they would be shipping to my house But no they shipped it to a shipping storefront where I have to drive into town to pick up And a lot of other businesses will have their packages when I get them shipped to end up being pick up there but none of them charge as much as Newegg for shipping when I end up having to pick up the packages in town And they wouldn't even give me a refund for the shipping cost For example the motherboard I bought for the hardware upgrade was through best buy shipping was free And it shipped to the same storefront for me to pick up Honestly their business has just gone down hill since they were bought by another company Since the above happened I have sworn to never purchase something from Newegg I even made it a policy at my company that we were never to use Newegg for any computer hardware purchases even as a last resort And we had spent a lot of money with Newegg yearly too
Don t ever use Newegg ever again They re actually the fucking worst Agreed but there really isn't much of an alternative anymore There is B H but they have limited supply So is Best Buy and Amazon has somewhat okay selection but pricing is all over the place There is no MicroCenter near me in Miami and antonline and digcamera or something isn't very good Next up is sketchy eB
Unfortunately for many people it is Newegg Amazon bad in other ways or nothing
This Used them once back in 2017 but never again Luckily i'm 25 mins from my local microcenter I'm spoiled rotten due to the proximity and shudder to think what would happen if I were to relocate
At what point are we going to say it's the people supporting them financially that are to be blamed It's well beyond rare now This is my 2nd post TODAY seeing a newegg scam top a subreddit
I bought memory from Newegg and it turned up in a dropshipped Amazon package Looking up the original price on Amazon it was 120 less Newegg really is trash trading in their reputation If you manually edit the URL parameters you can find your history going way back I'm a 20 year customer but probably not much in the future Not to mention my Netgear power line adapters arrived defective they had pass thru power sockets which were never populated so it was just a plastic hole in the shape of an AC socket Never could get a return
I though
I hate NewEgg but had to use them Nobody else has stock of cards like they do or the selection Fucking Microcenter wont ship because they want you coming to their store but the closest one to me is like 5 hrs away in Tustin Man i miss Frys Electronics
r buildapcsales should seriously consider not allowing Newegg links to be posted Newegg fucks us Fuck Newegg and don't post their deals
They are basically the optics planet of the electronics industry
Why did they delete their old youtube videos Beef with paul and kyle
I purchased two computers from them for a client Both were listed with 1TB SSDs but when the computers arrived they had HDDs When I called up Newegg they told me that it was a typo But 3 months prior someone had left a review complaining about the same thing Two days later they changed the HDD to SSD Their excuse for not sending me two SSDs ad a replacement was that SSDs are not compatible with your computers For the record I'm an IT consultant not an idiot I'm sure that excuse works for Average Joe but I called them out for lying to me and they stopped answering me Worst customer care
Stopped when gta5 came out on PC Don't remember exactly what processor it was but I ordered what ever high end AMD was out at the time 's lost it in Texas and made me wait 2 weeks before they declared it lost and refunded me Needless to say I didn't have my new proc for
Amazon is the real worst Newegg second Since there's no other option I gotta use Newegg There's other stuff like B H photography and such but they are usually more expensive I haven't been burned by Newegg yet but I'll drop them if it ever happens to me
These people are stuck on
I had my card stolen Not my account but my credit card Someone went on a spending spree I reported the card as stolen to Newegg and they banned my own account which had no fraud and refunded me for nothing I was able to get a portion of my money back through my credit card company but still
It pisses me off so bad that they have the most amount of stock of 4090 cards
B and H Photo is still good and they ship faster than newegg
Honestly Best Buy has really won me over I bought my new phone through them and got 980 for the thing 490 towards my new phone balance with Verizon and a 490 gift card used the gift card to buy myself a 3060 12gb I m CPU bound on anything better and I have insurance on the phone for free
Amazon is letting scalpers list cards with 50 upcharges Screw them too
Sucks too because I was about to get an Intel A770 from them where else can you get those No microcenter doesn't work for me
I've sworn allegiance to my local microcenter I've been there several times and everything has gone super smooth Staff is wonderful and to me it's like a kid being in a toy store
Who do you buy from now I only go through the tech cycle every few years
Back in the day they had the best customer service the best pricing would cross ship items for replacements and were generally awesome Somewhere around 2010 they started looking for an IPO and wall st buzzards started getting in their ears and that was the end of that it was all shit since They literally could have amazoned before
NoEgg
I got my 4090 at 9 01am EST on launch and paid for 2 day shipping They delayed shipping by a day so it showed up Monday instead of Friday I sent a chat to customer service and they refunded me the extra shipping fee So not all interactions are bad but yea its slimy what happened to OP
I really don't think this is the big fiasco people are making this out to be It all sucks for sure no one wants to buy something only to get refunded and be told oops sorry bout your luck but it's clearly some sort of system that is in place to stop people from making multiple purchases of GPU's a system that people were crying for during the 3000 series era that had a false trigger because for all intents and purposes he purchased one 100 they should be able to remove the block so he can attempt a repurchase but lets not blow it out of proportion and make it seem like this was a purposeful 'anti consumer' move like they put the block on personally
They were legendarily good Always had stuff in stock amazing customer support and would ship your order lightning fast back when that wasn't the norm Not sure if they were sold or something but now I hear so many horror stories I'm afraid to use them
Microcenter is awesome but most of us don't have a store anywhere near us crying face If there was a store in my region I would be a regular shopper
They got bought by Chinese investors Now they do business like a Chinese company
You going to get one boss So far Newegg has done a drop on Tuesday and Thursday Best Buy on a Wed Seems to be pretty consistent to what they did when the 30 series first dropped Just have to be at the ready on those days and also inform bank to give the green light to newegg
What I don't understand is why anyone still uses newegg at all
They shouldn t charge till it ships
What s even worse is it s happening to a customer that understands the processes and isn t irate or being irrational I think that s what really triggers me is when customer service representatives and or the company they represent don t have any understanding of the situation nor do they care to act logically It s what I call a reverse Karen when the customer is being completely reasonable and the company acts unreasonably and treats them as if they re an idiot
It's a hint that you should buy somewhere else instead
Whats even worse you already paid for one and they got a new stock So instead of fulfilling your order they just cancelled yours and blocked you Seriously wtf Makes zero sense
Could you create another account using a different email Or is there some weird rule about no new accounts being able to buy a 4090
How long after ur order was it voided I have a Gigabyte confirmation and I would die if it gets taken away from meloudly crying face
I have never used newegg in my life but am thinking it's unavoidable for the Intel A770 which I am trying to get right now Might have to bite the bullet and use them microcenter is not actually around the corner from everyone which people seem to think
Oversells can be difficult to prevent in large scale web apps but this is still a customer service issue They should honor the oversell in the next batch without further action from the customer
I'm in the outer Banks so I'm afraid not
I can't believe you had time to put the coupons in
I wonder if they have to make a new account every time they snag one
I'm actually not familiar with the story I'll have to look that up
Should've turned on a VPN
Yea there have been small restocks almost daily
Wish I knew who to tag
I think we probably need that but I don't think that is where we are headed
No I have not successfully purchased a 4090 But despite that I have met my quota according to newegg
Or rather didn't
Correct it's the banking institution that keeps the hold during an authorization
Very jealous
I'm learning that cheers
There are some of us that don't have retailers anywhere near us
Worked great for me when I ordered my 3090 and 4090
I'm now learning that
price get PC Building FTFY Although payed exists the reason why autocorrection didn't help you it is only correct in Nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant The deck is yet to be payed Payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them The rope is payed out You can pull now Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment Beep boop I'm a bot
Which means that Newegg doesn't care enough to update their systems to account for such issues Their developers could create manual override options for the timers if their project managers deemed it a priority
I wish I had a brick and mortar to go to Tiger or Microcenter would be wonderful
I know I chickened out on the 1080ti back in the day ended up buying a 980ti It lasted me until last year Though it struggled I feel like part of their price increases is just knowing that the primary age of gamers has aged since those releases and now has higher incomes so they choose to take advantage of that I bet the average age of people purchasing high end equipment has increased significantly since then
I also believed the supply problem was fixed Something has to be done about the scalping
I'm glad you were able to get somewhere with them It sounds like you are in the lucky minority
I hope you were able to chargeback
How did you know that they were restocking
The one it let me buy momentarily was one of those bundles
That's not how that works
Hated lol Maybe by idiots
It's just an authorization so that should come off no problem
That s why you don t have a 4090
That sounds crazy
That's absolutely wild
I have zero I met the quota by buying the one they canceled
Apparently they are awful but I don't see any scalping
Feel free to direct me to the closest computer component brick and mortar to the Outer Banks
exactly why I work my ass off to be able to do it and not think twice about it
why are you surprised you've known about this for a month
This is literally the perfect context for using that phrase
I literally work in customer service for hospitality company If I had demanded a video card and said that it would be rude but for me to say that I shouldn't be being told that I've reached my purchase quota after they canceled my purchase and claiming bad customer service that's just accurate
Atx 3 0 is not required at all You fell for misinformation
ATX 3 is not necessary In the most extreme cases it may be helpful if your PSU is borderline I'm on a 1500 w power supply I have literally no concern about drawing too much power with a 4090
This would have been my first not my second or third
Escalate to someone that can help Same thing we do at my job
I'm not sure you ready my post That wasn't my primary complaint just part of the story
yet another bonus shipping a defective product that was RMA'd and not fixed and then claiming the customer broke it and refuse a refund Gamer's Nexus
I hate this about tech company's even one I've worked for OH grab the returns first they're good yea just ship those grabs an unopened box leading me to believe it wasn't checked for why it was returned A common scenario that shouldn't be common anywhere Crazy how many tech company's just assume there customer is dumb and that's why it was returned ridiculous
Then refusing returns claiming you're the one who swapped the product
It s entirely because they were purchased by some shit Chinese company called Hangzhou Liaison Interactive Terrible company literally doesn t give a fuck about the West or Europeans or pretty much anyone these days Seriously china is becoming a huge problem in the tech industry
Newegg is a different company entirely 's First line
Yup old newegg is gone replaced with Trash Tier's 'R Us
it's so sad newegg used to be the GOAT and now it's just fallen so far
back in like 2006 When I was in college I worked at a local PC repair retail and custom build shop around that time Newegg was so good back then Their retail pricing was cheaper than what we were paying our parts distributor Ma Labs can eat it too while we're on the topic and we switched over I kept sourcing throuch newegg after I left that shop and went out on my own for a little bit Easily ran hundreds of thousands through them over my college years and never had a single issue The new company they've become is just horrible and depressing I miss old newegg
I used to feel like such an in person for knowing to use newegg
Teach me your secret
What other online retailers do u recommend for pc parts electronics besides amazon
Sorry off topic I have an i9 9900k as well and was worried that it would bottleneck a 4090 how is it with the cpu Also curious if your PSU wattage
That's so sad how is this possible In europe there are like a thousand online stores several per country
I'm curious as to which way you think Amazon is bad
Newegg is becoming wish
What's wrong with Amazon
B H is a legit option for Canadians too Super easy very fast and often cheaper than buying in Canada
Took a full week to get my poorly packed newegg 4090 Seriously nutty
B and H has been awesome for me so far Quality service and good prices
You say that but im still waiting for my 13900k preorder while newegg shipped my 4090 day one
I bought a card at retail through Amazon you have to look for when it s being sold by Amazon themselves
Amazon doesn't police their third party markets No ecomerace markets do I'm not suggesting you buy scalped cards on Amazon If you find a card sold at MSRP it's at least a much safer purchase than Newegg
Nevermind that In the UK Amazon is scalping directly 2500 for MSI Suprim X sold direct from Amazon Pretty sure they were going for 2000 on launch day
F A might as well be Ebay
It's not Amazon's job to say what vendors can list their items for That would be absurd You don't have to buy the card listed at a 50 mark up and I recommend that no one does That's the only way we beat the scalpers you don't need the thing so badly that you should spend 50 more for it They'll stop scalping the shit when people stop buying it for absurd mark ups
Unfortunately I think Newegg and Microcenter are the only places carrying them right now in the US anyway
I should have mentioned Microcenter but that's not an option for a lot of people The nearest one for me is a bit over an hour each way For many folks it's far more than that
Microcenter and Amazon
Amazon BHphoto sometimes direct from manufacturer Whatever shows up on buildapcsales I did use Newegg to buy a part for my most recent build but not for the GPU For the most high dollar items I'd rather get it from Amazon for their customer service which is still some of the best out there
Straight from the company in question or I travel a short distance to a magical place called Micro Center
The exact same thing happened to me Got my 4090 at 9 01am eastern launch morning paid the extra for 2 day shipping so I could have it on the weekend to set up properly and test out for my content since those are the two days I m off my day job Not only did they confirm my shipping date and time that day and the next it wasn t until less than 12 hours when I was to receive the GPU was I notified and not even by Newegg it was by UPS I did call and they refunded the shipping cost which I appreciate but I would have 100 tried to buy from Best Buy so I could ve been able to create content the first weekend The same thing happened with my DDR5 ram the week or two before What I don t understand is why when UPS delivers on Saturdays and Sundays in my city neighborhood Newegg doesn t let those packages that are already shipping and in transit to be delivered those days My GPU arrived the Friday in my city and sat there until Monday rolled around when Newegg packages deliver Every other company I buy from has weekend deliveries I can understand a little if they don t want to process initial orders on the weekends not really but I can let that slide but packages that are already in my city can t be delivered I even contacted UPS and they said that because of Neweggs policy I wasn t even allowed to go to the UPS store to pick up the package Which I have done many times with other companies It s just all around not customer friendly in the slightest But here is to everyone who is trying to get a 4090 a quick and easy purchasing process
Fair enough however it's pretty clear this issue goes beyond interactions as it is due to at best a failure of an anti bot system or at worst blatant baiting folks out of their money hoping to get additional revenue via bundles and or ancillary purchases I'll buy a case and PSU too
Oh hey someone who can look at the situation objectively is this still Reddit
They got boughy by some chinese company and then went to shit Like most companies bought by chinese companies
Seriously The closest one to me is over 300 miles away Hell I'd go if it was only 100
The bank is good Newegg is blocking me from purchasing for 48 hours because their system thinks I already bought one Even though they voided that purchase
But I really appreciate the positive sentiment
Depending on where you live you don't really have options
I don't know the specifics for Newegg but it's pretty standard to put an authorization hold at the time of purchase to make sure you have the funds Then once shipped they settle the hold which debits the funds from your account Otherwise they could waste time trying to fulfill orders only to find out at the last second that the payment won't go through
I snagged a Gigabyte 4090 OC today they charged be while its 'packaging' so yeah your charged before its ships
Essentially The email they send when they boys you said they don't do backorders Also I seriously don't think that they got another delivery an hour later They are either trickling them out or realized they had more the whole time
That's probably a good idea I just want them to not treat us shitty I've had this account with them for like a decade if I do what you're mentioning I'll end up with two that I have to keep track of At the end of the world but you would think someone would be able to reset the quota marker and say that I didn't actually get anything
Like 2 minutes after it was placed for me
They should atleast wait for the purchase to hit the uncached database before charging your card
Amazon is successful because of convenience and undercutting their competition Believe me they don't care about you any more than Newegg does
I edited my comment with links to their videos for ya
Very jealous None of that here
Any C level execs Company founders etc If you want to find my tweet from years ago that might help I'll dm you my Twitter profile
Okay that s extremely dumb Sorry that s happening
gets paid There I fixed it for you bot
This is my frustration
TigerDirect predates NewEgg by decades and is a decent online retailer Ive never had an issue that TigerDirect didnt fix appropriately including RMAs Microcenter also sells online but their best deals are usually in store only
Not just that These cards are going for upwards of 2 500 Where the heck are ppl getting the money to buy up all these cards SMH
Yeah this was like 5 years ago though The problem is that their inventory system is pretty garbage and has been for awhile This also totally shouldn't happen on a new item where the counts should be 100 accurate
I've been refreshing whenever I'm not doing something else
How about not supporting shady stores
Not spending that much on a video card
Oh I see that sucks Sorry
Thank you to your contribution to capitalism your sacrifice is noted On a more serious note Do you even have time to play games and have fun it
Not to the CS rep They re not responsible for this can t do anything about it and it s very derivative There are much better ways at expressing disappointment than sending an entitled sounding message This is what you say when you are showing other people not while talking directly to the CS rep
It s never a good time to use that Just make your point and move forward What else is it going to add Not a fan of what happened to customers first It s such an entitled thing to say to a minimum wage live chat worker who doesn t make these rules for NewEgg Still new egg is trash
Nope I didn t fell I m deliberately not rushing those cards for the reasons I ve stated And yes you can use provided and 3rd party adapters I know that
You can ask to be escalated instead of being passive aggressive
Yeah the whole situation sucks but that's what happens when you deal with billion dollar online companies You'll never talk to anyone who actually gives a shit about you Most likely it's someone struggling to survive in India somewhere They're laughing at your struggles beaming face with smiling eyes
Yeah that s exactly what I meant They re so scummy
And another Newegg not checking a return and another customer buying a graphics card that has weights instead of an actual card
That has to be illegal Isn't that theft What was the outcome of that situation
Glad that you said that not supporting Newegg anymore Cheers
You should have ended your sentence with problem and you d be closer to the truth face with tears of joy
Huge problem in any industry frankly
Don't know much but my friend says that warranty is a huge issue in china They'll open the box and check that it's working then when an issue develops afterwards it's a hassle to get a resolution
It has nothing to do with China or Chinese but everything to do with the fact that they are pretty much the only online retailer that carries everything at launch and ships anywhere that also did so 20 years ago and now only really have 2 major competitors Their competition is Amazon and BB and to lesser extend MC for those who live near one So they earned name recognition became very large and have no real competition Of course they are going to be cunts It doesn't matter if they are owned by greedy Chinese cunts or greedy Caucasian cunts they have name recognition and not enough competition to keep them in check The goal is to continue to cut costs while also increasing revenue Your problem is not with China it is with rich greedy people looking to make a fast buck while being as shitty as possible to consumers You are also a racist complaining about people that are different from you in general and blaming them for the failures of capitalism
Really I didn't realize this Thanks I definitely don't want to give business to a company that doesn't care about their customers I realize there's sometimes logistics challenges and various problems with retail I'm patient and 't focused on customer
In the tech industry China has BEEN a massive problem to the entire world Their culture the pollution the unethical ocean and sea farms their contributions to animal endangerment or extinctions the stealing of copyrighted IPs man the list just goes on
I swear to god anything bought by a Chinese company that isn't with the intent to manipulate and undermine the west like t ncent goes to shit every time It's like they accelerate the inevitable decline of publicly traded companies in persuit of maximum profits
Do you have personal experience with that company How much responsibility should fall on local management I don't recall any Asians meeting Tech Jesus when he went to confront them about the motherboard Also China is part of the supply chain of almost every tech product out there people seem happy buying iPhones without caring where they come from Or are you looking for another Asian country to exploit for cheap labour that falls in line
China is becoming an ever increasing problem in the world in general
Do you have a recommendation for a replacement I was going to newegg instead of amazon
It's only a matter of time until they become the next NCIX
So Newegg is like digital Pyrex then eh
we lost Fry's because a corrupt exec embezzled a lot of money somewhere around 65 Million And for what money he didn't embezzle he abused vendors and distributors until the Fry's brand was completely blacklisted He is in fact considered one of the worst losers in the history of Las Vegas Owing somewhere in the ballpark of 120 Million to the casinos
Back around 2016 bought a 1080 from them not only did it not fucking work Consecutively they sent 3 MORE 1080s that also didn't fucking work
Teach me your secret Buying an expensive gaming shit shouldn't be hard to find
Best Buy and Microcenter
For Canadians Memory Express in my experience has been fine
As others have stated If you're in the United States there is Best Buy Amazon B H CDW very unreliable in 3000 series launch and Microcenter if you're lucky enough to live by one
B H
Us Best buy i guess Also check AIB's websites also
Hey while I haven't done any extensive tests on it I did apply a minor overclock on my 4090 and I run a 850W PSU with no issues whatsoever so far There is some bottleneck with the 9900k but I play at 4K 120hz with an LG C2 so it's not much of a bottleneck at that resolution hz I can't justify upgrading everything at the moment to try a new CPU for not much of a gain at that resolution
We have a few small alternatives but they cannot compete in price
q why is amazon bad
Amazon engages in binning and it means they have no way of tracking what came from where Let's take an example say there are two Amazon sellers of Founders Edition 4090's Nvidia Store and a Chinese store called LolFake Both companies provide four RTX 4090s to the Amazon warehouse near you ready to be shipped the moment someone orders one Amazon takes all eight cards puts them into a box and any time someone orders a 4090 they reach into the box pull out a card and ship it out Did you order from Nvidia Store Don't know which 4090 you got Saved 1000 by ordering from LolFake Hey you might get lucky So later you get a fake card It's a metal slab in a box You open a dispute Amazon checks your order You spent the higher price to order from Nvidia Store Those guys always sell real cards super trustworthy Your dispute is deniedand your Amazon account is flagged for scamming You are out 1900 From there maybe your credit card charges back or whatnot but shit it never should have come to this in the first place You got screwed and nobody believes you Even your CC company are victims now and they have to decide whether to charge back and eat the loss or side with Amazon against the customer
I haven't seen any cards for msrp there I don't have a problem with them as a company though they have treated me well
Do they ship easily to Canada too
Gotta check out B H I use memory express in Canada they price match with Newegg I was at the one in Hamilton for an SSD and they mentioned for the next 2 months they are also giving you a 30 discount on top of a price match if you find anything cheaper in newegg and Amazon Just as a heads up for anyone in Canada
You sure you actually ordered from B H And not one of the marketplaces on their site instead Their packaging and shipping are usually top notch but the products listed as special order are being packaged shipped by third parties usually the OEM but not always
Anyway to limit it to amazon only when searching I dont see that flag on the left hand side
They certainly do They gatekeep certain categories only allowing pre approved sellers in those categories after a long vetting process They can do this with the the gpu category if they wanted to It also keeps the scalpers in check as pricing would also be strictly enforced and your one off guy who lined up at microcenter just to flip has to go elsewhere
Just dont buy them I dont If nobody buys them then the scalpers take a bath
Are you sure they legally could get away with price requirements without getting hit by antitrust suits
That's what I thought and I was hoping I was wrong I heard Best Buy might soon get them but it won't be soon enough I literally cannot get an A770 at all this is ridiculous I hope I can get one not from newegg but if I must then I will more importantly I hope I can get one soon
Best Buy eBay
Even Microcenter is getting pretty scummy Their marketing team has always been absolute cancer at least at the Kansas City location and now their instore pricing and sales is getting pretty toxic They still have a A warranty program and trustworthy stock so they are still my 1 retail choice
Thanks everyone for the info I've mostly used best buy online for my current update as I'm already a totaltech member and am comfortable with their customer service but newegg has always been the place I go to next as I didnt know better
Same shit here Mine came Tuesday
saturday delivery costs extra
Also started charging sales tax
Fuck Newegg they don t deserve your money
Got ya did a reread and I see now But still you got this
Then buy one from someone else Is NewEgg the only one who has stock
Make a new account and use a different card slightly different spelling of address and name
Or they could charge you and hold 1700 of your money ransom 5 7 day because they refuse to pay the fee to refund the money immediately Believe it or not they can give it back as fast as they take it They just don t want to pay the fee
Yes to reiterate I am not upset about the authorization
Oh yeah I get that I m just saying they SHOULDN T till it ships OK hand light skin tone
At least you got one sir I'm happy for you
Within 2 minutes for me as well So you should be safe
I didn't want to ask but thank you for taking the time I'm going to check them out tonight
I still haven't had any luck And I'm a 6hour drive from a Microcenter
Cheers
Yea I would definitely use other options for more readily available components
I would say I hope no one is buying them But if you take a look at ebay most of them have bids already
Ok I ll definitely try that Thanks by the way how many gpus have you bought that they put a limit
I bought my 3090 and 4090 from them two years apart from each other and had zero issues So I can t really call them shady
So worth it
Ya sorry a few people thought that I was scalping but I'm just trying to get one for me
Yup sure do and have a wife and 3 kids and have hobbies outside of gaming like being on the water and mountain biking What else would you like to know
True
In all fairness this is all about first world problems
I'm guessing someone from newegg stole the card and send out the box and weight The story then is blamed to a phantom customer The launch date is 12th I don't think it's even possible to complete a sale return resale process in one week
yeah i just saw that too
I ve been on this train since BEFORE the whole open box Debacle I suggest anyone in this thread do the same I ve never had more headaches with anyone then them NewEgg makes bestBuy look like a charity And that says a whole fucking LOT It sucks because now new egg haters and everyone who wants to bad mouth them is going to come out to talk shit on this thread But in reality they are just shitty No offense not trying to be rude but They just are OP s situation the guy MISSING his 4090 when he opened his box when it came It s just unacceptable You re literally better off shopping at fucking B H B FUCKING H Very sad Someone please show this to Steve over at nexus
Yup rather drive 2 hours to a microcenter or hit up a Bestbuy than give money to Newegg or Amazon cause they are essentially 2 big 2 compete with
You got me there haha
and the sad part of it is that we allow it and even enable it
Thank you The borderline racism here has been rough
I miss Fry's
He is in fact considered one of the worst losers Yeah he sounds like a fuckin' lo in the history of Las Vegas Owing somewhere in the ballpark of 120 Million to the casinos Oh like LITERALLY a loser lol But also a loser
How is that their fault If the cards were truly defective were they part of the same batch Retailers don't open boxes and test things to make sure they work they rely on their suppliers to deliver good products Did you possibly have something wrong with your setup such as marginal power supply Not that I am defending them it's just that this could not be caused by them unless they were all returns that they falsely considered good I got my 1080 from them near launch it was awful and I eventually scored an MSI that was well over Nvidia's MSRP It was clear that they allowed the pricing to go up due to demand and it was just shitty Now they do the shitty PSU bundle thing
At least they tried s
Shouldn'
Careful with best buy too they make no indication if youre actually buying the card or just a chance at one backorder They got me with that shit just keep in mind
Ew best buy
Amazon is also terrible with sending you their unchecked returns I received an old mobile processor instead of the i7 I ordered I generally don t order anything expensive from them anymore I just successfully received a 4090 from Newegg but was holding my breath until I powered it up B H is one of the few I fell comfortable with in 2022 I just ordered from Microcenter for the first time and I got the product Atari Arcade Fightstick and I was disappointed they didn t double box
Best Buy doesn't really have
BH is great Im on a list for the 4090 through them they are doing them via notification only so when its available and Im up in queue Ill know and not have to camp websites They are also great for other PC related parts when they have them in stock as well as weapon sights and scopes
Very nice I have a 850W too very cool cause I was thinking I d have to buy a whole new pc lmao I m gaming on a 1440p 240hz monitor as my main with 2 others at 144hz and 60hz though Thank you for your time and response
There is some bottleneck with the 9900k but I play at 4K 120hz with an LG C2 so it's not much of a bottleneck at that resolution hz I hate to break it to you but your 9900k is likely bottlenecking your 4090 even at 4K As per TechPowerup's benchmarking a 12900k will give up to 26 7 better performance averaging 6 5 better at 4K with a 4090 compared to a 5800x And as far as I can tell the 5800x outperforms the 9900k when gaming
Good butt
They don't do this with all items so you're just spreading bs at this point
I haven't heard this before If that is true it is interesting
And here I was expecting a regular OSHA or bottle pissing story Anyway if that is true why aren t people getting freeish gpus this way Setup LolWayoverpriced LLC Provide Amazon w metal slabs order your own overpriced offerings get the real thing profit
Gotcha They do list cards for MRSP but they get bought quickly by bots or people camping out the listing so then only the third party sellers show If you re interested there s people on Twitter that have bots which will tweet out alerts when there s stock
Very easy They bake in the duty fees which are sometimes only a dollar and no extra hoops when filling in your shipping info Very fast too considering it's crossing the boarder

No should have been clearer I was complaining about newegg
search 1 4090 Click on the amazon tab in the results list
Often if it s available through Amazon it shows them first but not always On the mobile app there s a section under the prices and buy buttons that says Other sellers on Amazon and compare new and used Clicking that will bring up a list of sellers and you can see if A
Best Buy jumped the shark and decided to charge to get an opportunity to buy a card Fuck Best Buy eBay is just a bunch of scalpers
I buy everything I can from my local MC in Cambridge
If you think amazon treats their workers poorly wait until you see how Best Buy treats them
That's pretty universal online now thanks to South Dakota v Wayfair
That's every online retailer now That's not a Newegg thing
He's also out the money for a new card due to the hold also If they don't have extra they're now fucked
There's also a fee for holding an authorization till it expires I believe it's even more expensive than the fee to reverse the authorization immediately Using quotes there because barely anything actually shows up on your statement immediately I'd be very surprised to hear that any major retailer is not doing authorization reversals They probably just say 5 7 days because they need a buffer for the lag between the retailer submitting an authorization reversal and the time it takes for that to be reflected in your bank account Edit Actually it might be a fine not a fee I can't remember
The consumer doesn t win
Man Im sorry that happened to you at no fault of your own hang in there and PLEASE dont buy from POS scalpers You will get one bro soon get 'instocknow' app on your cell phone and text alert
I had 6 purchases go through Newegg today and the first 5 were voided within 2 minutes They're still popping up for sale every so often I had The first 4 times were on mobile but the last two I was on my PC I didn't get locked out from attempting to buy another all attempts were on the same account
No problem bud Sorry for your luck That s absolutely infuriating having that much money tied up with nothing to show for it
No physical shops here to buy high end PC stuff from so it's online retailers only and the supply has been hilariously low Everyone was saying there was loads of 4090 supply vs the 3090 It seems exactly the same to me Guessing all the cards are going to the US P
Fwiw I hate social media with Twitter being just about the worst Unfortunately I worked at a fortune 500 supporting those channels Tweets get results for users Even when they shouldn't Just annoy the right exec and you are set
It sucks online has harmed brick and mortar stores though MicroCenter seems to be the exception Mainly because they don't have a million stores everywhere When I'm buying stuff like this I want to see it I want to put two boxes side by side and compare I want to check out a case and open it I can't do that on Amazon or NewEgg I absolutely can in a MicroCenter Unfortunately I live ten minutes from one I say unfortunately because that is dangerous for my wallet rolling on the floor laughing
Zero They are counting the overstock void as a purchase
Good for you I guess
You still find time to play games on your expensive GPU I also have a high paying job and can afford this without much concern but I realized I don t have enough time to enjoy it to make it a worthwhile investment
This happened with 30 series I remember more than one post about it
It makes me wish Micro Center would pop up in more locations There's just not enough options for local tech stores
NewEgg makes BestBuy look like a charity On that note I used to think BestBuy as alright customer service Until I bought 12900K recently for about 590 and found out within a week it was down to 550 on other sites The product description said something about no price match but BB policy says that CPUs are under price match So I call BB CC just to try my luck and the representative was so honest that she herself found out the cheapest price somewhere was 514 at a random place I asked for 550 Not only she refunded the difference between product price but also tax just WOW Meanwhile NewEgg price matched after approximating store credit and of course no tax refund it was for price drop in DDR5 sticks which still keeps falling every weekface with tears of joy
Maybe unpopular but BestBuy has gotten a lot better in recent years beside the return policy
What is wrong with B H They have always been great except for the 'no business on shabbas' thing
I'm in Texas and still love NY based B H Prompt service and great customer service and communions Fuck Newegg though Have spent lots of money there over the years Microcenter is the homie these days
B H is the shit I have no idea what gave you the impression they were anything other than awesome Do they have the widest selection of different parts No But their shipping is fast as fuck I've had 2 day shipped orders placed in the early AM arrive the same day and I don't even live in NYC and their customer service is like what Newegg's used to be back in their prime
What's wrong with b h
Tech Jesus forgives New Eggs sins
Wait till they make their move on Taiwan Which is only a matter of time weeks maybe and you can kiss goodbye to the tech industry that s the only reason why I might start listening to that little voice in my head that makes me want to be unreasonable and get my needed upgrades before semi conductors market s implose face with spiral eyes
It's not really borderline Bigotry online is out of control these days Did you have any luck today scoring a 4090
If you think Newegg is the worst Best Buy Seriously Friend got called the n word by the geek squad and they hung the phone up when we called corporate about it
It doesn t look too big in these jeans
And how do you know which items they do it with which items they don't
Yes they also bin returns So who returned a metal slab No way to know
Good to know thanks for the tip
Talking about buying from actual storefronts through eBay rather than individual people have had a lot of success with that eBay has great consumer protections as well if anything goes wrong would trust them far more than Newegg and prices are good Disagree on Best Buy but seems like you're holding a grudge rather than seeing their currently good inventory prices and experience
Lol if you are talking about Totaltech it is an absolute joke Never had a chance to buy the cards early I have been a member for years because their other services are actually quite good
eBay is just a bunch of scalpers The management or the millions of independent sellers of new and second hand goods That's one hell of a blanket statement you made there champ rolling on the floor laughing
If he sends his screenshot to his bank he 100 can dispute it and they will release it immediately and if NewEgg attempts to charge it their transaction will fail
All I know is that I went through the drive thru at McDonald s I purchased two sausage McMuffins and two hash browns 5 48 Well the hero employee entered 548 00 On a Thursday at 8am I didn t get my money back till the following Tuesday morning So if they took it or not I couldn t spend it Which is bullshit
Yea its pretty standard to let them expire I think its more about the time needed to contact banking institutions and cancel them
No scalpers for me
Honestly from my perspective it is the same
Yeah I'm sure my wallet is better off But I'm still jealous
Yeah it s been great That s why I never believe these stories people post about Newegg
It seems to really depend on the type of job you land
Yea I would kill for a Microcenter within a few hours of me
Not at all my friend The opposite of unpopular I LOVE bestbuy A whole lot at that
Yea What is wrong with B H I haven't lived in NY in some time but they were my go to for camera gear still are really though I don't buy much from them these days and were always great
Lol exactly Don t forget about succos and being closed during literally ONLY launches But nothing is wrong with them At all I love B H But not for the same reason I like the places I buy my PC components from I go to B H because I needed a TV and I wanted to get my fianc a new DSLR she loves photography However B H is never really my first choice for GPU s or really anything Computer related like at all Except for maybe like a monitor that I got there 8 years ago Which I still use as a main today But that s it Monitors cameras etc not really actual things I m going to put in my computer you know Nothing personal really Just don t like navigating their website Rather go to amazon tbh Plus B H tends to never have anything in stock Like things that are always in stock on Amazon or other retailers NEVER are on B H It just gets annoying is all
You must ve missed my other comments I like B H Like I ve said already Just not gonna scour it for motherboards and Ram If they have a monitor or a GPU I want of course I ll buy it
I sure hope he does face with tears of joy
2 to 5 years earliest Just enough time to get some domestic chip production going
I've actually thought the same thing The fact though that Taiwan is the leader in chip production by such a wide margin Is the only reason China hasn't made a move against them
People need to stop saying this The USA is actively invested in defending Taiwan and has said multiple times that an attack on Taiwan is an attack on the US China is not going to destory its entire economy and everything it has built ip by going to war with the entire western world over Taiwan which in turn would lead to billions of deaths globally Chinese leaders aren't stupid they have nothing to gain and only talk about Taiwan as a ploy for its own nationalism And before you say But Russia and Ukraine no country was in a pact with Ukraine or had any previously spoken agreement to protect it Thats why Russia was able to invade in the first place
No no luck how about yourself
Fat bot
I'm not holding a grudge so much as remembering which businesses happily took advantage of their customers when they had the opportunity to do so I'll grant that may be just semantics for some people though
This is not true at all do you have proof any of what you just said
Crediting someone for a pending charge is usually way more complicated than just sending a screenshot over The FI I used to work at requires the merchant themselves to fax a verification letter stating they will not collect the funds
So no buying from NVIDIA
I'm happy it worked out for you but what exactly do you not believe
I don t think Amazon sold a single 4090 card yet except on AM from scalpers They don t list the 13th gen Intel CPUs yet Not trying to defend Newegg I think all our options aren t great presently
Thats what ive been thinking since the plans for more domestic chip production were announced Once production ratches up Taiwan is gonna be less and less relevant theyll have quality and expertise but maybe in a couple years the US wont be talking direct intervention if China makes a move
Let s hope
It s not the only reason actually Another major reason it the fact that all the islands that surrounds the coast of China including Taiwan are a political barrier that prevent China ease of access to open sea for deploying it s nuclear submarines and exponentially growing military fleets That s why they ve been super aggressive in annexing tiny rocks in the middle of nowhere injecting massive quantities of concrete to build huge infrastructures on them the size of a Carrier or bigger to artificially enter the category of an island that gives access to legal claim of the surrounding 20 Nautical Miles And of course have a new spawn point for their Air Force to provide support for the next one Rince and repeat There is a lot of tension in these tiny islands for years with Japan mainly the Philippines Vietnam and a few other countries with belongings in the area If Taiwan falls its the end of that barrier The U S and all the countries in the region that righteously fears the Chinese expansionism don t want that
Am I misled or was there not an agreement with Ukraine US Russia over some nuclear weapons after WW2 I'm sure there's tons of misinformation out there pardon my ignorance
We don't suffer atrocious healthcare education poverty and workplace protections for nothing in the US Our military remains top notch
I have an MSI coming from Amazon by 11 1 but am gunning for an FE because it fits easier Looking at videos for my case I can rearrange it to take the MSI one and only lose 1 HDD so it's not much of a loss I also have a Gigabyte OC coming to Best Buy that I am going to cancel I am going to wait until it arrives at the store in Salem NH and see if I can find someone who wants to see if they can be at the store when I cancel and then talk to customer service to buy it I have no clue if that is possible but it seems like it should work
loudly crying face my code is super optimized tho
Yes that is how business works If you don't like what they're offering 't spend money on it Obviously Right now their offers are good at that point they were not Seems pretty simple
That is the way you truly feel and its not just a grudge against BB Then please cancel your ISP and never go online ever again I mean if any company is out to screw people its ISP's and I don't care who they are I have yet to ever hear about a ISP doing the right thing for the consumer unless there a mega benefit for them somewhere down the line or there forced by the legal system The same goes for Cellphone service and pretty much every utility in all truthfulness
I have had to fill out a form attesting that it was a real thing but they required evidence screenshots showing that the vendor acknowledged the charge was canceled but the hold was 's plenty of evidence
I don't follow you can't scalp your own product
Not yours But someone posted the other day an empty box they recieved
I agree I meant less about brand new Gen s current releases and more just like stock in general but You are absolutely correct
You are right Ukraine had some nuclear stock that belonged to Russia after the soviet collapse We promised Ukraine if they would give up their nukes that we would support them if their country was invaded I listened to one of the people that made that treaty happen on the BBC after the war started
You can read the full text on the UN website objid 0800000280401fbb objid 0800000280401fbb Russia has already broken the first 3 commitments in the Budapest Memorandum They could break the next two by nuking U
IPMed you
This is the textbook definition of a strawman
Imo it's a dance that doesn't have to happen This is both a failure of the merchant and the banking system in general
Semantics
Gotcha hard to know eh Did they have an unboxing video
You're not wrong But that doesn't make it any less of something we all get to deal with
SOoo what do you mean
