yeah Sapphire great
manufacturer try hit MSRP nVidia set have expensive component nVidia get GPU memory chip cost hit target explicitly inform target idea margin board design nVidia announce msrp publicly pretty terrible position
EVGA alert Nvidia decision April crypto crunch
kicker Nvidia simply squeeze AIB partner hard keep profit exactly new Nvidia common knowledge decade Nvidia act like dick partner AMD Sapphire AMD need EVGA getting kick Nvidia EVGA choose leave video card market focus product line motherboard keyboard power supply etc stop try push theory crypto mining near important video card maker video gamer buy production AMD Nvidia high end card year prior crypto continue long crypto fad footnote Wikipedia

reason go wait amd offer not worth 6900xt euro gaming near level
stop spread lie well ti average 4k raster 2x raytracing game nvidias marketing spread missinformation look like amazing deal trash value s
People think great look computer 1kw tilt pay hour play lmao
pointless comparison 3090ti place 3090ti start msrp compare equally price hardware vs 3080ti instead
good deal compare 40xx card performance dollar line good deal card generation performance gain come matching price increase
dislike NVIDIA greed high price outside non currency massacre exchange rate example Euro valuable usd usd actually slightly worth significantly increase price product strength currency entirely outside NVIDIA control price Europe go come Europeans etc hope quick end war
yep usd Turkey usd vat usd
know techboomer
hard find card stock
fast Ti NVIDIA late benchmark fast benchmark gigantic difference cost spend performance know spend buck extra get performance stead yea like say terrible value especially consider buy DLSS3 good think watch hwunboxe video
fanboy mentality Amd gpu past problem reason go NVidia Xplane open gl alot issue perfrmance tank radeon card vulkan ap sim xplane vulkan big deal amd good product cheap good value fit use case box mean
gray bar raw performance DLSS
yes try card look slow comparison rasterization high level dlss card offer see DLSS vs
focus gray card performance DLSS
true sell MSRP 3090s say wrong know Nvidia terrible financial quarter cite fall GPU sale conflict fact lot gpu sell inflated price situation defy basic fundamental supply demand
mean bear jump away
duopoly AMD similar perf shave top similar Nvidia perf perf lackluster entice pricing lot like Ryzen AMD competitive price hiking start shit happen Radeons good
exactly 90ti case fast cone shy great undercut heavily nvidia stay cocky inflation mining dead gamer not pay money mean unlaunche gb mix card lol need cut price heavily
give fact 3090ti fast 6950xt nearly fast launch AMD great driver fast close let real
like 3080ti yes basically gb nice 3080ti low power new feature probably bit well RT relatively well low resolution bad high one expect sheer difference mem b w way AMD able beat gb easily AMD goal well perf watt gen well 6900xt gb Nvidia number gb like well 3090ti
yeah base MSRP pricing exploitative obvious problem Ti 1000 brand new right GB GB
card embarrass win market share NVidia buy LOT prebuild people not care pc clue work furthermore lot non western country brand people know hear gpu AMD release GPU double power halft price buy trust market share not equal dominance performance
yes steam chart percentage picture historic sale current
yeah astroglide
EVGA finally learn d DLSS
feeling Ti come January March year AMD surprise NVIDIA response XT XT well NVIDIA expect cancel naming card humiliate
make hardware change close launch especially one drastic change maybe price drop
card manufacturer lmfao change like
eh NVIDIA x04 series die bit memory interface xx80 card Kepler suck outlier
general mood market right guy go to buy want buy mean push launch date sit shitload inventory mean AMD kinda Ryzen have pretty bad price performance ratio consider platform vast majority user mean affordable choice stuff year old Aka Ryzen feedback get retailer contact work sell base pc like crazy consumer be hope wait
want waste lol
make sense give timing announcement
People throw thing dramatic price MSRP sell totally understand people refuse buy card certain price point principle cash buy type card extreme enthusiast gamer content creator
interesting know truly sell pretend day sell marketing strategy
wow interesting different situation USA vs Europe Europe buy guess current 1 1 make expensive
think fast dlss depend game low super underwhelming
slightly slow RT raster performance case fast 3090ti use DLSS consider modder get DLSS series card go reason 2x fast 3090to Nvidia explicitly disable 3090ti ability generate pseudo frame config file price fine ok price performance stagnation artificial limitation
high price market decide price right small market idiot probably release few card usual sell shocker
make hilarious remove LHR mining effectively dead stop hold applause Nvidia
say right thing scam happen right thing correct shitty behavior
Nooo rtx free Nvidia bad allow profit base people pay product
fanboy justify Nvidia scummy marketing huh
Nvidia friend lmao company design money like pricing change
hate place card call line release
people live fanboy blind company defend shitty behavior
sorry downvote agree lol yes Nvidia friend decision goodness heart primary motivator profit end day go to praise company right thing say company long streak wrong thing Idk people expect company like well right decision
depend model fat margin GB well margin want maximize sale model
lol fr haha
think lot AIBs contract Foxconn etc actually produce card like NVIDIA FE card know EVGA expect probably happen AIBs allow cancel reserved production capacity find buy end NVIDIA actually plan TSMC let unreserve extra production capacity schedule misjudge long GPU crypto mining ridiculousness suspect AIBs lot RTX chip currently know put situation need use board production time gpu pay instead buy gob RTX chip leave NVIDIA unsold chip expect e g difference account solely increase order volume need board production capacity report investor ton expenditure expect revenue accompany tl dr NVIDIA fuck get greedy manufacturing way gpu see people actually willing pay take account people willing pay rich people shit cost people try use card ATM
purchase evga gtx SC euro sound ridiculous
factor operating cost example year operating cost high tariff war shortage etc Operating Income revenue say refer earning subtraction cost expense contrast operate income company profit subtract operating expense cost run daily business edit okay legitimately ask question know answer work nice hear vote Nvidia operating income year compare estimate card cost argue
inflation exist sure infinite growth possible
problem late stage capitalism problem People luxury product inflate way way way fast late final stage capitalism happen fall Rome nationalize nvidia amd intel big fail tech company point
honestly consider growth failure wall street projection right
AMD need card cam compete high end match time know time
sure bet insight supply chain feel free drop BOM cogs wait
sure mean try sue claim think know work
oh Tb instead gb lmao miss hear tb monster card rolling on the floor laughing
eh worth
event hang bunch like minded people day probably fun go camping hopefully GPU bring home souvenir
not actually cartell
agreed curious mid range card stack prior gen price optimistic
yeah wrongdoing try nearly double msrp card minor performance uplift accord benchmark gb slow 3090ti branding attempt sell card typically find prior series series GB double msrp card find 550 650 decade decent performance uplift entirely negate cost increase go take cleaner review
yeah gb
bit memory bus territory wonder cook think bit memory bus belong
think number cuda core supposedly gb 3x compare rest spec crank let hope tech reviewer hard release
3060ti beat gen
time unfortunately line offer terrible value perfomance
Sticker die
ga102 ga102 lol actually scratch one
increase price expensive comparable
nah kind people run buy limited supply go buy card day matter cost Nvidia happen lol maybe raise ti start work 10k people buy Titans day ti etc new financially irresponsible money let spend go buy card think pay kind limit comfortable spending truly need function graphic card system cash buy type money well spend real stuff like house car vet bill getaway emergency fund loan money family tight spot etc
make think launch success sell product sell easily manipulate regulate available stock actual unit sell tell success surprised sale great Nvidia damage control can card know sell

compare mining card price new Nvidia benchmark fast DLSS google look Dunno tiny tear overlay flight sim vs 2x frame rate good trade HU review negative latency native value look benchmark fast money benchmark DLSS stomp 3090ti mining like steal people wait good review clearly like flight sim bargain
face screaming in fearsmiling face with horn
time AMD beat Nvidia benchmark price people stop say know card necessarily beat hard beat lineup
allow anymore buy midrange Turing end pascal mining reason card raise time msrp finally dead live happen card maxwell nvidia want backlasche card actually insane people got fault bit nvidia want mega mining price normal gamer pay look 3090ti halfe price short time happen especially inflation rise cost play waiting game good deal bite ass month price half gb actually card lot room card like nvidia force card

guy day face with tears of joy
Nvidia go learn consumer will buy period use money essential good skyrocket result inflation like food energy wait badly Nvidia q4 earning
okay walk alternative relaunch rebrand currently moan
seriously performance drop drop hard
nah fat die series gpu

Nvidia right thing thought hate Nvidia king
People emotional lmao strawman recognize company take step right direction defend shitty behavior person facepalme
lol right Nvidia friend come obviously company friend lmao person facepalming
ahh talk dollar sale number fair
report income expense profit shareholder operate cost outpace income profit go shareholder income go actually account n increase profit expense depend type company have real profit fine long company grow income year year people think income decrease expense system kinda insane

Google search midrange card today clear midrange mid range
rx6600 go low
yeah psu want usb connection telemetry get tier 1000w version new connector sadly probably exact go drive 3090ti fe maybe little risk maybe
think case issue arise native cable atx ATX psu simply available people 4090s rig place order Ai1300p hopefully card fine matter throw base review see psu suppose excellent manage reach titanium efficiency certain wattage pass ATX test sweat
totally different series Ai1300p 80plus certificate mean different production line
old post refer think cause unknown great warranty support team care issue like ship load cable worldwide worry
yeah shit Sherlock understand perfectly clearly have difficulty comprehend say comment
People reproduce problem week agree deal fail pc fail official statement Nvidia courtesy advise card
difference bit hardware neglect like cpu absolutely bottleneck
unlaunch price drop
fuck care RT barely make difference make difference
AMD company company like money performance close price
base AMD marketing graph 1 7x etc vague performance improvement number match rasterization definitely RT 7900xtx vs interesting especially AMD big price advantage MSRP
git commit die
fuck headmate say go college America fix comma splice bet know
huh interesting guess microcenter sell early cuz def sell Seasonic ATX PSUs release sell TT psu time
failure create equal DoA different situation fire

dude you literally nit picking need spell mean statistic relate go high likelihood normally common fault burn cable adapter talk
say actually careful suspicious burn sus maybe read write carefully response try prove sense specifically say way know look man adapter burn people buy party cable party cable native cable burn think possibility correlation good cuz failure analysis work personally way know state burn willing bet common cause don t know sure

add Ti model make argument worse mid range say
personally use psu adapter direct line point potential failure

holy shit fuck stupid power connector literally literally difference Ti vs term 12vhpwr connection use aftermarket cable use Ti make difference
disagree major problem pr problem hold belief sale user have issue

fucking chill pill dude

Asus card common occurrence issue probably brand sell card
see trend aib card fes Asus MSI incident list Gigabyte likely coincidence large sample size sort trend
week release problem whatsoever thing adapter cable smooth plug trouble lose sag plug 300v wire mean give information
absolutely abuse windforce gpu work 3d Unreal Engine past year absolutely issue
yes ve vision suck cool EVGA card well cool degree run game load product gpu
gigabyte majority game OC card probably see game OC melt windforce say probably one sell produce
happen multiple model card see FE couple thing rule blame AIB partner design
day ve Gigabyte gaming OC max power volt check adapter twice issue tell thing sure adapter plug correctly
Gigabyte stop spread false news connector show problem melt close card 600w hot likely occur faulty cable include
card fan curve see 62c game
op far give definitive reason cable fail adapter decently build sub par independent tester unable recreate issue damage cable need account far statistically significant reported failure People believe happen cable plug way compound fact native pin cable melt theory good option know option truly safe ultimate cause issue good sure connection secure hope good
probably believe issue like keep defend adapter man shrugging light skin toneseriously tho pelle need stop adapter point cuz shit faulty hell
series
gold grade NZXT
watts volt 300w watt wire rate 300V 150V
heh
MSI PSU new point
Hyperbole
yeah warrant recall fast NZXT h1 class action lawsuit
yepp
noob come stuff know think cable come able handle
possible take long Cablemod great quality
error possible user accident standard design failure look case bend cable fire hazard
info plus awareness thing go word nVidia plus request return post
maybe people refuse believe issue post like well
know happen twice new atx psu right
wat pull
discuss melting rolling on the floor laughe
use connector think definitely issue man shrugging light skin tone
unconfirme strix far
honestly make sense actual connection look somewhat fine plastic ruin
stock dry
People die house fire post
wait house burn week
oppose bad see
literally face with tears of joy
thank dog make try well picture
bad cuticle help short nail bed
look like chew fingernail anxiety potentially have card melt maybe house catch fire
toefinger
maybe nice lawsuit go retire early force Nvidia finally statement go
mean injure smoke inhalation short power supply trip eventually like pc tower fill combustible material plasitc melt catch fire limited metal box guess set book paper pc potentially catch fire maybe
probably mean cooking

new video card build company instal system power connector overheat melt start house fire burn trap inside initiate recall number card field multiply probable rate failure B multiply average court settlement C times B time C equal X x cost recall
happen insane look 7900xtx heart set AMD reveal pricing add melt issue seriously consider move team red
ridiculous wait know infrastructure build receive card need release announcement customer mindful card leave run person present find happen
definitely recall post people say adapter case NVidia neglect Ohms law case pull current diameter cause excessive heat Aka push limit possible current safety net real life ton variation calculate fixable mean recall connector change expensive hell
apply formula number unit field b average rate failure c cost replace faulty unit pay damage axbxc x x cost recall
odd pin like PSUs connection
pray send DP
see plug think
go redesign note
recall adapter native pin power supply report
know real reason Jenson hold recall make statement recall pull shelf AMD fast card day approve slot card hold status
yup people say consider go AMD round run right Nvidia ordeal figure
yeah post day ago say
face with tears of joy
pathetic Nvidia come logo cable standard shift blame
like know mind sorry ya get to mess
expect tough time hear customer service pretty spotty
gb card seek warranty gb
thought exactly return store money cause stink raise hell burn place cite forum news site list fire hazard store oh sorry money want news x store knowingly sell potentially dangerous card burn customer house alternative deal Gigabyte AIB warranty likely ton headache maybe refurbish card week month later supply issue like poor choice
post see yesterday apparently country component mfgs like gigabyte msi accept RMA burn ridiculously scummy
probably tell warranty gigabyte return item gigabyte normal procedure easily interpret push blame gigabyte adapter logo Gigabyte send card adapter nvidia investigation
gigabyte card buy Ford truck capacitor component go maker capacitor replace responsibility Ford nvidia logo actually dchange thing nvidia sell connector box Gigabyte instal contact gigabyte gigabyte fix gigabyte go tell nvidia owe money contract state nvidia component melt
ok purchase time take start plug play burn
definitely bad new gen release thought new gen possible triple digit fps 4k sacrifice stick 1440p year totally fine
probably costly high rma rate drama continue talk people buy future month
use 2x eps12v connector like workstation card day
TI FE 3x8 pin 12vhpwr see mass failure burn cable non ti FE 2x8 pin sure need adpater 8pin power connector fine difference push power envolpe limit technically limit possible 12vhpwr standard test max support
know price develop maybe way cheap msrp month maybe new amd gpus sell way msrp mean look announcement like great deal take reach msrp non super month release get Euro msrp buck Mrsp set price stone
question know detail cable
hedge bet buy share AMD recall sell share buy xtx wait inevitable month s partially cluster fuck
Yep get

people say matter hard push click sound like design manufacture failure
Jonny corsair publicly apologize GN guru3d say stupid shit mistake say JG manage fail plug power connector correctly big problem nvidia problem
worry connector card way explain FE card survive aib card burn eventually heavy power load big recall industry history msi company follow EVGA Nvidia stock tank explain radio silence Nvidia AIBs issue start rich people lose lot money try delay
yeah cost spend 1600ish gpu risk burn use old fix adapter issue
start fire tho melt short go electrical fire
card 8pin connector rate low wattage cooler small card cost result win everybody
4x8 cable fix issue get liquid suprim arrive tomorrow wonder order

build SFF buy AMD time skin RX XT GPU AMD 5800x3d run gaming wise
point find new hobby cost price house mortgage yeah Nvidia justify GB FTC involve false advertising decide spend money euc instead later road AMD GPU want power hungry card require ATX power supply connector plug cycle limit time unplug replugge 8pin connector
better performance 3 time the size
TUF series joke 8pins whopping 375w power draw compare Strix OC 3090 3x8pin come 480w box show perf increase 4k card good component strix rate 1080w
yo ok
wonder go run hotter card work properly fire connector melt try supply thing power
drop stupid 12pin plug mind look backwards zany face
wow massive eh massive size massive price tag reach 2x perf

efficient efficiency high power draw exclusive
vote wallet buy low power option
1 5x 3090ti 450w efficient buy end card
effecient small low end skus card not mean
efficient people think see comment Ryzen undervolt low power draw buy xx90 card place btw remove SLI compare high end system past reasonable
start make thing efficient provide claim somewhat true gb 285w card well performance 3090ti
Nvidia hire insightful comment
amaze people understand powerful efficient efficient powerful head room
opt sensible power requirement efficiency slow die able justify charge stupid price people want product graphic card hardly buy sensible efficient option equally overpriced
Tbf Nvidia endgame sell physical hardware Enterprise Enthusiasts willing pay exorbitant price instead lease compute processing power tiered xaas model play game regular consumer
look AMD offer mile efficient vs Rx XT 6900xt beat pure rasterization watt
literally time able squeeze powerful pc barely benchmark accurate provide rasterization thermal design power increase repeat product range want electricity consumption decrease simply opt powerful model like

unfortunately blame user error give manufacture excuse deny RMA claim like happen card
sit connector clip click sound fully insert visible curious
failure rate honestly well expect expect 0 3 1 6 basically sure fully plug pull angle example case pull cable close pull plugged adapter angle understand taut wire mean pull cable hard direction leave leeway like adapter cable bent hard pull hard case aesthethic instead leave relaxed bend normally
risk factor

Err Corsair 12vhpwr cable bit build ATX pcie spec spec document literally provision sense pin hardwired lock specific configuration Corsair cable problem Nvidia apply spec different altogether unexpected way hardwire sense pin 600w like literally ic adapter sense number cable plug adjust sense pin dynamically configure adapter base number cable plug fact obvious technical communication vague consumer face infographic draw 450W 3x8 pin Jon sample product reasonable assumption Nvidia adapter hardwired diligence kind asshat certainly put blame past technical knowledge
maybe misremember think say video
oh yes way handle unacceptable consider little info Nvidia send AIBs pre launch doubt give PSU maker info brief handle adapter situation bad blood PSU folk Nvidia try pass launch RTX series transient crash bad PSUs lol
Nvidia send Corsair card test
like single car manufacturer vehicle change way wheel axle work tire manufacturer fully know overblown issue personal dm spec insanely confusing new
genuine question know Intersting pretty sure Steve Jonny collab vid past
think say impact addition IC adapter Corsairs power supply handle wattage say work adapter Corsairs 12vhpwr signal card deliver 600w power Jay test know Jay wrong lot mean testing testing think recommendation PSUs fine behavior uncalled look fool happy decision Corsair
comment like go Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lap stage want people speculate go when there EVGA ceo cV9QES FUAM t 490 source Tom news evga abandons gpu market reportedly cite conflict nvidia hard believe
moose fucker lol professional sound like get EVGA d suck
corsair confirm employee suspect employee impersonate head PSU R D
think Corsair release public apology statement fraudulent account okay lol man facepalming
let stick talk PSUs like cause damage talk gpu
get shit make perfectly reasonable assumption get shit diligence say people wrong work bullshit actually verify big difference
whew thank
skim video look closely cut sense wire power limit set 100 450w bar extend past certainly 133 600w cut 100 450w bar stop raise power limit like work correctly prior cut sense wire set power limit
disable pin test
Jayz video testing clear
IC require IC adjust sense pin ground need grind directly cable
GPU look sense pin care ground get 600W Corsair 600W cable ground sense pin cable connect hard wire GPU high power limit ability Nvidia adapter special small logic IC inside check number active input see set sense0 open sense1 ground tell GPU pull 450W see input set sense0 sense1 ground signal GPU use 600w
proper IC cable require GPU signal tell 450w Nvidia IC safety reason not use single 6pin 600w fuck plug 6pin connector 600w cable probably use daisy chain cable 600w plug 6pin 2pin separate connector Nvidia adapter want fire molex 6pin 6pin 2x 2pin 600w single 22awg cable let rip
say point poor analogy
nope associate tou certainly pay represent not shit
people think say dumb shit online ground company allegedly care fire surprised damn fiasco devolve armchair politic philosophy throw fancy greek word learn recently flex debating screen fucking monitor trust hr try fire fact stand despite genuinely brain ego quip fucking cable have entertaining meltdown probably little bit well inform power supply compare average redditor be throw away asset

theory wrong watch Gamers Nexus video know plenty video test theory able melt cable bad cause
probably coincidence brand company product reputation come brand livestock hot iron firebrand burn stick
Nvidia like mask happen good gpu
yeah mean close people buy nvidia launch get 7900xtx
lol outside give shit evga mention evgas dumb decision nvidia begin matter customer know evga thing people look end card issue way affect nvidia series problem
funny EVGA know problem actually decide stop make gpu leave wonder actual cause issue able recreate problem
Jensen know guy cult personality problem lol
agree
hold fix buy want try week success far jump 3090ti train new build think chew arm buy AMD GPU
posit theory dumbass people defend theory true understand small sample size draw conclusion definitively
perfect response ok hand
igorlab LN2 overclocke push 900wts connector mean cable spec paper theoretically able handle rate power load cable m inclined think way card pull load common power rail think debunk early pcb GPU
safety margin typical stock gaming load 150W easily 400W safety margin 12vhpwr connector x200B remember connector rate 680W load GPU rate max 450W overclocke gpu 600w begin optimize 4090s 360W x200B safety margin issue
defend Nvidia informed currently figure wrong guess release cuz fairly difficult actually reproduce melting
wonder odd sudden issue like user error wide spread
funny ppl buy 4090 issue fix burn wire know go happen
well way figure have issue pop development testing Nvidia choose cosplay CDPR come quality
connect card completely stock OC feel like blow pass 175hz monitor lol need OC

Windows design modern cpu thing intel
Windows consider e core low performance p core know core give frequency workload Windows combine instruction prioritization model Intel state Windows user expect lot well consistency performance come hybrid cpu design
Windows new cpu scheduler supposedly work well E p core new Intel chip say ea excuse bs let know know certainly difference os able work hardware primary function operating system manage hardware resource provide way run application hardware major os increment lot change hood os function
e cores work optimally Win11 game fuck optimization cpu bottleneck EA try blame user slightly decrease cpu performance short blame user new high end cpu play os essentially user possible blame user old cpu have gall modern GPU reveal shitty game cpu optimization look low GPU load
sweet sweet money spend stupid QA

publisher publish great game garbage game
EA get lot cool game Star Wars game particular good IMO care micro transaction factor hear game particular pretty good outside performance issue
Yo EA publisher personally like Respawn studio want close yeah blame want EA bad guy continue support Respawn tho money go EA tough price pay aware personally convinced respawn one blame poor state game
series good jedi survivor bar performance issue fantastic game bogge shit port
BF okay right come see broken day like EA mean hate EA kinda straw Star Wars game shock anymore
game trash EA adherence weird timeline properly optimize game release issue Fallen Order Jedi Survivor great game drag mud cause want extra month optimize well
not open crummy launcher remember fuckin credential
entirely assume EA pressure devs ship incomplete unoptimized game
publisher usually force relesase date product ready especially own EA like Respawn
remember game ship issue good job devs game ship issue blame publisher
lol hire work pretty simple
oh boy tell
case detail hand truth come eventually assume game ready ship EA force developer hand single soul Respawn want game ship poor state
funny tho
yeah quality mode 30fps ok performance mode borke inconsistant frametime stutter
play PS5 quality feel choppy easily tell imagine surprise switch performance get well
7800x3d bottleneck 1440p ultrawide fsr area
mean optimize W11 way know test kind thing
funny fall order time issue launch despite look bad have gameplay mechanic content
fps dip fps tier hardware fine clown pass
s pay EA play instead go to finish week uninstall game
think right comment see state read line config file verification run res subjectively disable FSR look 100x well run game 4k go need source pixel counter subscribe random comment
game cpu bottleneck DLSS damn thing aside maybe well aa till fix like FSR damn thing Frame Generation help say
depend X3D 7800X3D problem Windows chiplet core access V Cache effectively standard cpu high priority core eye os talk high core count X3D chip core access V Cache Windows scheduler improvement necessary
Intel real world final framerate difference average game like talk
yeah sure run line gen intel CPU Windows problem e core affect issue AM4 AMD cpu suffer low utilization window problem game problem
thread director work W10 optimize W11 mean practice difference
Afaik problem series ryzen win11
lot reviewer AMD hardware get performance issue doubt lot reviewer play game day patch available see tell people reality today
look QA
example game glare technical issue getting fix patch Jedi Fallen Order prequel game
game reportedly suffer cpu 3d cache e p core new schedule handle well plus Windows market software app windows 10 windows 10 windows 11 market share spike month here Windows grant office computer laptop good share idiotic EA little effort evaluate window performance circumstance
oh man suck run fine setup assume good port tend lucky one avoid problem come bad port
EA comparable balanced component totally fault
doubt denovu console probably respawn rush project EA work overtime fix platform
result actually W10 interested know accurate statement performance differ W11
actually village drm
lol people mad denuvo actually work stop day piracy invent fake news people mad
actually wrong Google Denuvo remove Villiage game get well

kid Diablo buggy mess officially release Word Blizzard face mass exodus pandemic restriction lift mind fact probably reel harassment scandal well have open beta week official release have single short live beta session
exactly open beta pre order d4 early access reward have open beta pre order year legitimately impressed game beta hopefully mistake
boat s funny get early year mind blow product like know like job
way anymore Xbox strip window machine run Radeon point Xbox architecture git port easy couple generation literally pc
sure
honestly pretty meta release game optimize include denuvo blame vs release unfinished product later release patch fix remove denuvo think denuvo shit
Denuvo fault
new Denuvo use gb vram
Idk help remove Denuvo ecosystem big win
let blame totally one blame botch drm implementation
game quality tank decade hit new low
completely break RT patch reflection display wrong texture texture allow wall shadow ultra act like wall half castle let light stream AO apparently bit fuck Shit ridiculous
crazy empress pirate version run like dream shocked encounter bug people buy encounter 1080ti old school ray trace eliminate bug time happen RDR2 constantly crash pirated version complain get free
vram texture quality use try turn setting possible
patch run like garbage texture randomly turn ps1 era mush apparent reason intentional fix low vram player
fix texture problem like day ago scour google day find way fix
pretty sure completely give texture load properly FPS reasonable GB vram GPU point dev team probably eh fps look good job good bye actually act honest tell GB VRAM GPU owner lower texture low medium fair play feel little bit dishonest personal experience game good have GB vram
patch money devs cost money money exec get bonus
symptom insufficient vram instead jarring stutter mushy texture terrible well
Hogwarts legacy run fine proper pc
people throw money pre order reason shit work long change
guess consumer allow away want product wish finish
PS1 mushy texture vram limitation pathetic fix force game unload texture memory seemingly random prevent stuttering lack vram vram gpu defend game developer shitty port
plus Denuvo attach game force install broken update game require internet connection
sad bootleg version stable
imagine go Cinemas see bunch wire people green suit fly onscreen lol
think go crazy patch absolutely solid way revert
usually wait year buy game price usually 20 30 lucky maybe catch sale great steal price patch DLC release package deal include get pillar eternity DLC
People buy happen point get to realise preordere game turn shit contribute problem fork buck AAA single player title dev need possible abandon game waste money people buy obviously gross oversimplifaction valid point nonetheless
People buy day wait decent review free money company
ERP software qa tech production machine niche
hope update alongside gen release
well test patch confirm performance improve example
Forspoken run well actually reach fps lauch not FPS run 4k DLSS 5600x

ald lake Ryzen well performance window well cpu scheduler test confirm true bad developer bottleneck
video online reputable hardware reviewer show difference test come gaming great difference window Windows strongly encourage new hardware cpu schedule well delegate task thread somewhat well window cripple performance overall thing make assumption see lot report people happen late hardware window window read excuse
right miss point read line say people new hardware window instead window assume hint scheduler window cause issue new hardware game Windows fine Intel gen Ryzen window scheduler play well new cpu big little core
come window not buggy pos remote evidence improve gaming performance
forever ago good bet skip Windows release skip XP skip Vista skip skip Microsoft notorious release garbage version Windows half time consider list
respawn ea
recommend enterprise Microsoft Azure Cloud Server plan
get suggest window instead
plus Win98 like mb installation Super thin resource bet ya single thread cpu give time

true devs fuck port lol
happen build QA test internally denuvo push directly devs final build usually fly fast time add say case happen studio work couple friend major studio
wonder hire people Reddit shill course fall apart soon call blatant bullshit like claim Denuvo use vram cause low cpu utilization lol
cool point post
drm implementation performance problem see game far
AAA studio gaming
AAA corporately produce game mean squeeze dollar user ton independent small studio make incredible game brand recognition ip like starwar million dollar marketing push game face second
hit Atari level
yeah refund thing publisher like stop people refund miss time window
far bad take Redditors
yeah completely give game fix buy high end video card look half bake broken raytracing implementation
1080ti gb VRAM probably play 1080p 1440p card lot people gb gpu low 1080p run vram cause stuttery mess texture pop etc
getting downvote look like right hardware unboxed video show
gb not consider low vram MID
symptom insufficient optimization
hardware unboxed video expose issue texture pop show gb card low resolution
hmm Windows
res setting curious pick eventually
reason refund Jedi Survivor play controller deal shite frame look forward fresh narrative experience fuck go to watch cutscene compilation
XD crack read gen i5 safe will play game release want
nope 1080p
way happy play good performance weekend wish
